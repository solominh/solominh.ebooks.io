<h3 class="h1" id="ch17"><a id="page_101" class="calibre2"></a>CHAPTER 17<br class="calibre8"/>Panama Canal Negotiations and Graham Greene</h3>
<p class="noindent">Saudi Arabia made many careers. Mine was already well on the way, but my successes in the desert kingdom certainly opened new doors for me. By 1977, I had built a small empire that included a staff of around twenty professionals headquartered in our Boston office, and a stable of consultants from MAIN’s other departments and offices scattered across the globe. I had become the youngest partner in the firm’s hundred-year history. In addition to my title of Chief Economist, I was named manager of Economics and Regional Planning. I was lecturing at Harvard and other venues, and newspapers were soliciting articles from me about current events.<sup class="calibre7"><a id="ch17note1"></a><a class="nounder" href="not.html#ch17_note1">1</a></sup> I owned a sailing yacht that was docked in Boston Harbor next to the historic battleship <em class="calibre6">Constitution</em>, “Old Ironsides,” renowned for subduing the Barbary pirates not long after the Revolutionary War. I was being paid an excellent salary and I had equity that promised to elevate me to the rarified heights of millionaire well before I turned forty. True, my marriage had fallen apart, but I was spending time with beautiful and fascinating women on several continents.</p>
<p class="indent">Bruno came up with an idea for an innovative approach to forecasting: an econometric model based on the writings of a turn-of-the-century Russian mathematician. The model involved assigning subjective probabilities to predictions that certain specific sectors of an economy would grow. It seemed an ideal tool to justify the inflated rates of increase we liked to show in order to obtain large loans, and Bruno asked me to see what I could do with the concept.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_102"></a>I brought a young MIT mathematician, Dr. Nadipuram Prasad, into my department and gave him a budget. Within six months he developed the Markov method for econometric modeling. Together we hammered out a series of technical papers that presented Markov as a revolutionary method for forecasting the impact of infrastructure investment on economic development.</p>
<p class="indent">It was exactly what we wanted: a tool that scientifically “proved” we were doing countries a favor by helping them incur debts they would never be able to pay off. In addition, only a highly skilled econometrician with lots of time and money could possibly comprehend the intricacies of Markov or question its conclusions. The papers were published by several prestigious organizations, and we formally presented them at conferences and universities in a number of countries. The papers—and we—became famous throughout the industry.<sup class="calibre7"><a id="ch17note2"></a><a class="nounder" href="not.html#ch17_note2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Omar Torrijos and I honored our secret agreement. I made sure our studies were honest and that our recommendations took into account the poor. Although I heard grumbling that my forecasts in Panama were not up to their usual inflated standards, and even that they smacked of socialism, the fact was that MAIN kept winning contracts from the Torrijos government. These contracts included a first—to provide innovative master plans that involved agriculture along with the more traditional infrastructure sectors. I also watched from the sidelines as Torrijos and Jimmy Carter set out to renegotiate the Canal Treaty.</p>
<p class="indent">The Canal negotiations generated great interest and great passions around the world. People everywhere waited to see whether the United States would do what most of the rest of the world believed was the right thing—allow the Panamanians to take control—or would instead try to reestablish our global version of Manifest Destiny, which had been shaken by our Vietnam debacle. For many, it appeared that a reasonable and compassionate man had been elected to the U.S. presidency at just the right time. However, the conservative bastions of Washington and the pulpits of the religious right rang with indignation. How could we give up this bulwark of national defense, this symbol of U.S. ingenuity, this ribbon of water that tied South America’s fortunes to the whims of U.S. commercial interests?</p>
<p class="indent">During my trips to Panama, I became accustomed to staying at <a id="page_103"></a>the Hotel Continental. However, on my fifth visit I moved across the street to the Hotel Panama because the Continental was undergoing renovations and the construction was very noisy. At first, I resented the inconvenience—the Continental had been my home away from home. But now the expansive lobby where I sat, with its rattan chairs and paddle-bladed wooden ceiling fans, was growing on me. It could have been the set of <em class="calibre6">Casablanca,</em> and I fantasized that Humphrey Bogart might stroll in at any moment. I set down the copy of the <em class="calibre6">New York Review of Books,</em> in which I had just finished reading a Graham Greene article about Panama, and stared up at those fans, recalling an evening almost two years earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">“Ford is a weak president who won’t be reelected,” Omar Torrijos predicted in 1975. He was speaking to a group of influential Panamanians. I was one of the few foreigners who had been invited to the elegant old club with its whirring ceiling fans. “That’s the reason I decided to accelerate this Canal issue. It’s a good time to launch an all-out political battle to win it back.”</p>
<p class="indent">The speech inspired me. I returned to my hotel room and scratched out a letter that I eventually mailed to the <em class="calibre6">Boston Globe</em>. Back in Boston, an editor responded by calling me at my office to request that I write an Op-Ed piece. “Colonialism in Panama Has No Place in 1975” took up nearly half the page opposite the editorials in the September 19, 1975, edition.</p>
<p class="indent">The article cited three specific reasons for transferring the Canal to Panama. First, “the present situation is unjust—a good reason for any decision.” Second, “the existing treaty creates far graver security risks than would result from turning more control over to the Panamanians.” I referenced a study conducted by the Interoceanic Canal Commission, which concluded that “traffic could be halted for two years by a bomb planted—conceivably by one man—in the side of Gatun Dam,” a point General Torrijos himself had publicly emphasized. And third, “the present situation is creating serious problems for already-troubled United States–Latin American relations.” I ended with the following:</p>
<p class="blockquote">The best way of assuring the continued and efficient operation of the Canal is to help Panamanians gain control over and responsibility for it. In so doing, we could take <a id="page_104"></a>pride in initiating an action that would reaffirm commitments to the cause of self-determination to which we pledged ourselves 200 years ago…</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Colonialism was in vogue at the turn of the century (early 1900s) as it had been in 1775. Perhaps ratification of such a treaty can be understood in the context of those times. Today it is without justification. Colonialism has no place in 1975. We, celebrating our bicentennial, should realize this, and act accordingly.<sup class="calibre7"><a id="ch17note3"></a><a class="nounder" href="not.html#ch17_note3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Writing that piece was a bold move on my part, especially since I had recently been made a partner at MAIN. Partners were expected to avoid the press and certainly to refrain from publishing political diatribes on the editorial pages of New England’s most prestigious newspaper. I received through interoffice mail a pile of nasty, mostly anonymous notes stapled to copies of the article. I was certain that I recognized the handwriting on one as that of Charlie Illingworth. My first project manager had been at MAIN for over ten years (compared to less than five for me) and was not yet a partner. A fierce skull and crossbones figured prominently on the note, and its message was simple: “Is this Commie really a partner in our firm?”</p>
<p class="indent">Bruno summoned me to his office and said, “You’ll get loads of grief over this. MAIN’s a pretty conservative place. But I want you to know I think you’re smart. Torrijos will love it; I do hope you’re sending him a copy. Good. Well, these jokers here in this office, the ones who think Torrijos is a Socialist, really won’t give a damn as long as the work flows in.”</p>
<p class="indent">Bruno had been right—as usual. Now it was 1977, Carter was in the White House, and serious Canal negotiations were under way. Many of MAIN’s competitors had taken the wrong side and had been turned out of Panama, but our work had multiplied. And I was sitting in the lobby of the Hotel Panama, having just finished reading an article by Graham Greene in the <em class="calibre6">New York Review of Books.</em></p>
<p class="indent">The article, “The Country with Five Frontiers,” was a gutsy piece that included a discussion of corruption among senior officers in Panama’s National Guard. The author pointed out that the general himself admitted to giving many of his staff special privileges, such as superior housing, because “If I don’t pay them, the CIA will.” The clear implication was that the U.S. intelligence community was <a id="page_105"></a>determined to undermine the wishes of President Carter and, if necessary, would bribe Panama’s military chiefs into sabotaging the treaty negotiations.<sup class="calibre7"><a id="ch17note4"></a><a class="nounder" href="not.html#ch17_note4">4</a></sup> I could not help but wonder if the jackals had begun to circle Torrijos.</p>
<p class="indent">I had seen a photograph in the “People” section of <em class="calibre6">TIME</em> or <em class="calibre6">Newsweek</em> of Torrijos and Greene sitting together; the caption indicated that the writer was a special guest who had become a good friend. I wondered how the general felt about this novelist, whom he apparently trusted, writing such a critique.</p>
<p class="indent">Graham Greene’s article raised another question, one that related to that day in 1972 when I had sat across a coffee table from Torrijos. At the time, I had assumed that Torrijos knew the foreign aid game was there to make him rich while shackling his country with debt. I had been sure he knew that the process was based on the assumption that men in power are corruptible, and that his decision not to seek personal benefit—but rather to use foreign aid to truly help his people—would be seen as a threat that might eventually topple the entire system. The world was watching this man; his actions had ramifications that reached far beyond Panama and would therefore not be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="indent">I had wondered how the corporatocracy would react if loans made to Panama helped the poor without contributing to impossible debts. Now I wondered whether Torrijos regretted the deal he and I had struck that day—and I wasn’t quite sure how I felt about those deals myself. I had stepped back from my EHM role. I had played his game instead of mine, accepting his insistence on honesty in exchange for more contracts. In purely economic terms, it had been a wise business decision for MAIN. Nonetheless, it had been inconsistent with what Claudine had instilled in me; it was not advancing the global empire. Had it now unleashed the jackals?</p>
<p class="indent">I recalled thinking, when I left Torrijos’s bungalow that day, that Latin American history is littered with dead heroes. A system based on corrupting public figures does not take kindly to public figures who refuse to be corrupted.</p>
<p class="indent">Then I thought my eyes were playing tricks. A familiar figure was walking slowly across the lobby. At first, I was so confused that I believed it was Humphrey Bogart, but Bogart was long deceased. Then I recognized the man ambling past me as one of the great figures in modern English literature, author of <em class="calibre6">The Pride and the Glory, The</em> <a id="page_106"></a><em class="calibre6">Comedians</em>, <em class="calibre6">Our Man in Havana</em>, and of the article I had just set down on the table next to me. Graham Greene hesitated a moment, peered around, and headed for the coffee shop.</p>
<p class="indent">I was tempted to call out or to run after him, but I stopped myself. An inner voice said he needed his privacy; another warned that he would shun me. I picked up the <em class="calibre6">New York Review of Books</em> and was surprised a moment later to discover that I was standing in the doorway to the coffee shop.</p>
<p class="indent">I had breakfasted earlier that morning, and the maitre d’ gave me an odd look. I glanced around. Graham Greene sat alone at a table near the wall. I pointed to the table beside him.</p>
<p class="indent">“Over there,” I told the maitre d’. “Can I sit there for another breakfast?”</p>
<p class="indent">I was always a good tipper; the maitre d’ smiled knowingly and led me to the table.</p>
<p class="indent">The novelist was absorbed in his newspaper. I ordered coffee and a croissant with honey. I wanted to discover Greene’s thoughts about Panama, Torrijos, and the Canal affair, but had no idea how to initiate such a conversation. Then he looked up to take a sip from his glass.</p>
<p class="indent">“Excuse me,” I said.</p>
<p class="indent">He glared at me—or so it seemed. “Yes?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I hate to intrude. But you are Graham Greene, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Why, yes indeed.” He smiled warmly. “Most people in Panama don’t recognize me.”</p>
<p class="indent">I gushed that he was my favorite novelist, and then gave him a brief life history, including my work at MAIN and my meetings with Torrijos. He asked if I was the consultant who had written an article about the United States getting out of Panama. “In the <em class="calibre6">Boston Globe</em>, if I recall correctly.”</p>
<p class="indent">I was flabbergasted.</p>
<p class="indent">“A courageous thing to do, given your position,” he said. “Won’t you join me?”</p>
<p class="indent">I moved to his table and sat there with him for what must have been an hour and a half. I realized as we chatted how very close to Torrijos he had grown. He spoke of the general at times like a father speaking about his son.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_107"></a>“The general,” he said, “invited me to write a book about his country. I’m doing just that. This one will be nonfiction—something a bit off the line for me.”</p>
<p class="indent">I asked him why he usually wrote novels instead of nonfiction.</p>
<p class="indent">“Fiction is safer,” he said. “Most of my subject matter is controversial. Vietnam. Haiti. The Mexican Revolution. A lot of publishers would be afraid to publish nonfiction about these matters.” He pointed at the <em class="calibre6">New York Review of Books,</em> where it lay on the table I had vacated. “Words like those can cause a great deal of damage.” Then he smiled. “Besides, I like to write fiction. It gives me much greater freedom.” He looked at me intensely. “The important thing is to write about things that matter. Like your <em class="calibre6">Globe</em> article about the Canal.”</p>
<p class="indent">His admiration for Torrijos was obvious. It seemed that Panama’s head of state could impress a novelist every bit as much as he impressed the poor and dispossessed. Equally obvious was Greene’s concern for his friend’s life.</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s a huge endeavor,” he exclaimed, “taking on the Giant of the North.” He shook his head sadly. “I fear for his safety.”</p>
<p class="indent">Then it was time for him to leave.</p>
<p class="indent">“Must catch a flight to France,” he said, rising slowly and shaking my hand. He peered into my eyes. “Why don’t you write a book?” He gave me an encouraging nod. “It’s in you. But remember, make it about things that matter.” He turned and walked away. Then he stopped and came back a few steps into the restaurant.</p>
<p class="indent">“Don’t worry,” he said. “The general will prevail. He’ll get the Canal back.”</p>
<p class="indent">Torrijos did get it back. In that same year, 1977, he successfully negotiated new treaties with President Carter that transferred the Canal Zone and the Canal itself over to Panamanian control. Then the White House had to convince the U.S. Congress to ratify it. A long and arduous battle ensued. In the final tally, the Canal Treaty was ratified by a single vote. Conservatives swore revenge.</p>
<p class="indent">When Graham Greene’s nonfiction book <em class="calibre6">Getting to Know the General</em> came out many years later, it was dedicated, “To the friends of my friend, Omar Torrijos, in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama.”<sup class="calibre7"><a id="ch17note5"></a><a class="nounder" href="not.html#ch17_note5">5</a></sup></p>
