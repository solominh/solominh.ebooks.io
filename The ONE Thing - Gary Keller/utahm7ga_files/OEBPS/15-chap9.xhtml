	<p class="right1"><big class="sanspink1">“We are kept from our goal, not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal.”</big></p>

</div>
<p class="first">The Big Bad Wolf. Big Bad John. From folktales to folk songs, the suggestion that big and bad go together has been a common theme across history—so much so that many think they’re synonymous. They’re not. Big can be bad and bad can be big, but they’re not one and the same. They aren’t inherently related.</p>
<p class="ind">A big opportunity is better than a small one, but a small problem is better than a big one. Sometimes you want the biggest<a id="page85" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> present under the tree and sometimes you want the smallest. Often a big laugh or a big cry is just what you need, and every so often a small chuckle and a few tears will do the trick. Big and bad are no more tied together than small and good.</p>
<p class="ind"><span class="grayunderline">Big is bad is a lie.</span></p>
<p class="ind">It’s quite possibly the worst lie of all, for if you fear big success, you’ll either avoid it or sabotage your efforts to achieve it.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">WHO’S AFRAID OF THE BIG BAD BIG?</h3>
<p class="noind1">Place big and results in the same room and a lot of people balk or walk. Mention big with achievement and their first thoughts are <i class="calibre6">hard, complicated,</i> and <i class="calibre6">time-consuming. Difficult to get there</i> and <i class="calibre6">complex once you do</i> pretty much sums up their views. <i class="calibre6">Overwhelming</i> and <i class="calibre6">intimidating</i> is what they feel. For some reason there is the fear that big success brings crushing pressure and stress, that the pursuit of it robs them of not only time with family and friends but eventually their health. Uncertain of the right to achieve big, or fearful of what might happen if they try and fall short, their head spins just thinking about it and they immediately doubt they have a head for heights.</p>
<p class="ind">All of this reinforces a “dis-ease” with the very idea of big. To invent a word, call it <i class="calibre6">megaphobia</i>—the irrational fear of big.</p>
<p class="ind">When we connect big with bad, we trigger shrinking thinking. Lowering our trajectory feels safe. Staying where we are feels prudent. But the opposite is true: When big is believed to be bad, small thinking rules the day and big never sees the light of it.</p>
<h3 class="subhead" id="page86">FLAT WRONG</h3>
<p class="noind1">How many ships didn’t sail because of the belief that the earth was flat? How much progress was impeded because man wasn’t supposed to breathe underwater, fly through the air, or venture into outer space? Historically, we’ve done a remarkably poor job of estimating our limits. The good news is that science isn’t about guessing, but rather the art of progressing.</p>
<p class="ind">And so is your life.</p>
<p class="ind">None of us knows our limits. Borders and boundaries may be clear on a map, but when we apply them to our lives, the lines aren’t so apparent. I was once asked if I thought thinking big was realistic. I paused to reflect on this and then said, “Let me ask you a question first: Do you know what your limits are?” “No,” was the reply. So I said that it seemed the question was irrelevant. <span class="grayunderline">No one knows their ultimate ceiling</span> for achievement, so worrying about it is a waste of time. What if someone told you that you could never achieve above a certain level? That you were required to pick an upper limit which you could never exceed? What would you pick? A low one or a high one? I think we know the answer. Put in this situation, we would all do the same thing—go big. Why? Because you wouldn’t want to limit yourself.</p>
<p class="ind">When you allow yourself to accept that big is about who you can become, you look at it differently.</p>
<p class="ind">In this context, big is a placeholder for what you might call a leap of possibility. It’s the office intern visualizing the boardroom or a penniless immigrant imagining a business revolution. It’s about bold ideas that might threaten your comfort zones but simultaneously reflect your greatest<a id="page87" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> opportunities. Believing in big frees you to ask different questions, follow different paths, and try new things. This opens the doors to possibilities that until now only lived inside you.</p>
<p class="ind">Sabeer Bhatia arrived in America with only $250 in his pocket, but he wasn’t alone. Sabeer came with big plans and the belief that he could grow a business faster than any business in history. And he did. He created Hotmail. Microsoft, a witness to Hotmail’s meteoric rise, eventually bought it for $400 million.</p>
<p class="ind">According to his mentor, Farouk Arjani, Sabeer’s success was directly related to his ability to think big. “What set Sabeer apart from the hundreds of entrepreneurs I’ve met is the gargantuan size of his dream. Even before he had a product, before he had any money behind him, he was completely convinced that he was going to build a major company that would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He had an unrelenting conviction that he was not just going to build a run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley company. But over time I realized, by golly, he was probably going to pull it off.”</p>
<p class="ind">As of 2011, Hotmail ranked as one of the most successful webmail service providers in the world, with more than 360 million active users.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">GOING BIG</h3>
<p class="noind1">Thinking big is essential to extraordinary results. Success requires action, and action requires thought. But here’s the catch—<span class="grayunderline">the only actions that become springboards to succeeding big are those informed by big thinking to begin with.</span> Make this connection, and the importance of how big you think begins to sink in.</p>
<p class="figimage" id="page88"><img alt="image" src="TheOneThing00871.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="fig" id="fig13"><span class="fignum">FIG. 13</span> Thinking informs actions and actions determine outcomes.</p>
<p class="ind">Everyone has the same amount of time, and hard work is simply hard work. As a result, what you do in the time you work determines what you achieve. And since what you do is determined by what you think, how big you think becomes the launching pad for how high you achieve.</p>
<p class="ind">Think of it this way. Every level of achievement requires its own combination of what you do, how you do it, and who you do it with. The trouble is that the combination of what, how, and who that gets you to one level of success won’t naturally evolve to a better combination that leads to the next level of success. Doing something one way doesn’t always lay the foundation for doing something better, nor does a relationship with one person automatically set the stage for a more successful relationship with another. It’s unfortunate,<a id="page89" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> but these things don’t build on each other. If you learn to do something one way, and with one set of relationships, that may work fine until you want to achieve more. It’s then that you’ll discover you’ve created an artificial ceiling of achievement for yourself that may be too hard to break through. In effect, you’ve boxed yourself in when there is a simple way to avoid it. Think as big as you possibly can and base what you do, how you do it, and who you do it with on succeeding at that level. It just might take you more than your lifetime to run into the walls of a box this big.</p>
<p class="ind">When people talk about “reinventing” their career or their business, small boxes are often the root cause. <span class="grayunderline">What you build today will either empower or restrict you tomorrow.</span> It will either serve as a platform for the next level of your success or as a box, trapping you where you are.</p>

</div>
<p class="ind">Big gives you the best chance for extraordinary results today and tomorrow. When Arthur Guinness set up his first brewery, he signed a 9,000-year lease. When J. K. Rowling conceived Harry Potter, she thought big and envisioned seven years at Hogwarts before she penned the first chapter of the first of seven books. Before Sam Walton opened the first Wal-Mart, he envisioned a business so big that he felt he needed to go ahead and set up his future estate plan to minimize inheritance taxes. By thinking big, long before he made it big, he was able to save his family an estimated $11 to $13 billion in estate taxes. Transferring the wealth of one of the greatest companies ever built as tax-free as possible requires thinking big from the beginning.</p>
<p class="ind">Thinking big isn’t just about business. Candace Lightner started Mothers Against Drunk Driving in 1980 after her daughter was killed in a hit-and-run accident by a drunk driver. Today, MADD has saved more than 300,000 lives. As a six-year-old in 1998, Ryan Hreljac was inspired by stories told by his teacher to help bring clean water to Africa. Today his foundation, Ryan’s Well, has improved conditions and helped bring safe water to over 750,000 people in 16 countries. Derreck Kayongo recognized both the waste and hidden value in getting new soap into hotels every day. So in 2009 he created the Global Soap Project, which has provided more than 250,000 bars of soap in 21 countries, helping combat child mortality by simply giving impoverished people the chance to wash their hands.</p>
<p class="ind" id="page91">Asking big questions can be daunting. Big goals can seem unattainable at first. Yet how many times have you set out to do something that seemed like a real stretch at the time, only to discover it was much easier than you thought? Sometimes things are easier than we imagine, and truthfully sometimes they’re a lot harder. That’s when it’s important to realize that on the journey to achieving big, you get bigger. Big requires growth, and by the time you arrive, you’re big too! What seemed an insurmountable mountain from a distance is just a small hill when you arrive—at least in proportion to the person you’ve become. Your thinking, your skills, your relationships, your sense of what is possible and what it takes all grow on the journey to big.</p>
<p class="ind">As you experience big, you become big.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">THE BIG DEAL</h3>
<p class="noind1">For more than four decades, Stanford psychologist Carol S. Dweck has studied the science of how our self-conceptions influence our actions. Her work offers great insight into why thinking big is such a big deal.</p>
<p class="ind">Dweck’s work with children revealed two mindsets in action—a “growth” mindset that generally thinks big and seeks growth and a “fixed” mindset that places artificial limits and avoids failure. Growth-minded students, as she calls them, employ better learning strategies, experience less helplessness, exhibit more positive effort, and achieve more in the classroom than their fixed-minded peers. They are less likely to place limits on their lives and more likely to reach for their potential. Dweck points out that mindsets can and do change. Like any other habit, you set your mind to it until the right mindset becomes routine.</p>
<p class="ind" id="page92">When Scott Forstall started recruiting talent to his newly formed team, he warned that the top-secret project would provide ample opportunities to “make mistakes and struggle, but eventually we may do something that we’ll remember the rest of our lives.” He gave this curious pitch to superstars across the company, but only took those who <i class="calibre6">immediately</i> jumped at the challenge. He was looking for “growth-minded” people, as he later shared with Dweck after reading her book. Why is this significant? While you’ve probably never even heard of Forstall, you’ve certainly heard of what his team created. Forstall was a senior vice president at Apple, and the team he formed created the iPhone.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">BLOWING UP YOUR LIFE</h3>
<p class="noind1">Big stands for greatness—extraordinary results. Pursue a big life and you’re pursuing the greatest life you can possibly live. To live great, you have to think big. You must be open to the possibility that your life and what you accomplish can become great. Achievement and abundance show up because they’re the natural outcomes of doing the right things with no limits attached.</p>
<p class="ind">Don’t fear big. Fear mediocrity. Fear waste. Fear the lack of living to your fullest. When we fear big, we either consciously or subconsciously work against it. We either run toward lesser outcomes and opportunities or we simply run away from the big ones. If courage isn’t the absence of fear, but moving past it, then thinking big isn’t the absence of doubts, but moving past them. <span class="grayunderline">Only living big will let you experience your true life and work potential.</span></p>

	<h3 class="subheadpink" id="page93">BIG IDEAS</h3>
</div>
<ol class="calibre10">
	<li class="calibre9"><b class="sans1">Think big</b>. Avoid incremental thinking that simply asks, “What do I do next?” This is at best the slow lane to success and, at worst, the off ramp. Ask bigger questions. A good rule of thumb is to double down everywhere in your life. If your goal is ten, ask the question: “How can I reach 20?” Set a goal so far above what you want that you’ll be building a plan that practically guarantees your original goal.</li>
	<li class="calibre9"><b class="sans1">Don’t order from the menu.</b> Apple’s celebrated 1997 “Think Different” ad campaign featured icons like Ali, Dylan, Einstein, Hitchcock, Picasso, Gandhi, and others who “saw things differently” and who went on to transform the world we know. The point was that they didn’t choose from the available options; they imagined outcomes that no one else had. They ignored the menu and ordered their own creations. As the ad reminds us, <i class="calibre6">“People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the only ones who do.”</i></li>
	<li class="calibre9"><b class="sans1">Act bold</b>. Big thoughts go nowhere without bold action. Once you’ve asked a big question, pause to imagine what life looks like with the answer. If you still can’t imagine it, go study people who have already achieved it. What are the models, systems, habits, and relationships of other people who have found the answer? As much as we’d like to believe we’re all different, what consistently works for others will almost always work for us.</li>
	<li class="calibre9"><b class="sans1">Don’t fear failure.</b> It’s as much a part of your journey to extraordinary results as success. Adopt a growth<a id="page94" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> mindset, and don’t be afraid of where it can take you. Extraordinary results aren’t built solely on extraordinary results. They’re built on failure too. In fact, it would be accurate to say that we fail our way to success. When we fail, we stop, ask what we need to do to succeed, learn from our mistakes, and grow. Don’t be afraid to fail. See it as part of your learning process and keep striving for your true potential.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ind">Don’t let small thinking cut your life down to size. Think big, aim high, act bold. And see just how big you can blow up your life.</p>
