<h3 class="subhead">GARY KELLER</h3>
<p class="noind1">Professionally, Gary’s ONE Thing is teaching. He excelled as a real estate salesperson by teaching clients how to make great home buying-and-selling decisions. As a real estate sales manager, he recruited agents through training and helped them build their careers the same way. As cofounder and chairman of the board, he built Keller Williams Realty International from a single office in Austin, Texas, to the largest real estate company in North America by using his skills as a teacher, trainer, and coach. Gary defines leadership as “teaching people how to think the way they need to think so they<a id="page237" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> can do what they need to do when they need to do it, so they can get what they want when they want it.”</p>
<p class="ind">An Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year and finalist for <i class="calibre6">Inc.</i> magazine’s Entrepreneur of the Year, Keller is recognized as one of the most influential leaders in the real estate industry. He has also helped many small business owners and entrepreneurs find success through three nationally bestselling books: <i class="calibre6">The Millionaire Real Estate Agent, The Millionaire Real Estate Investor,</i> and <i class="calibre6">SHIFT: How Top Real Estate Agents Tackle Tough Times.</i> A book, after all, is just another way to<a id="page238" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> teach, but one with an infinitely large classroom. As a business coach and national trainer, Gary has helped countless others realize extraordinary results by narrowing their focus to their own ONE Thing.</p>
<p class="ind">Unsurprising to those who know him, Gary believes that his single greatest achievement is the life he’s built with his wife Mary and their son John.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">JAY PAPASAN</h3>
<p class="noind1">Jay is the executive editor and vice president of publishing at Keller Williams Realty and president of Rellek Publishing. Professionally, his ONE Thing is writing. He attempted to write his first book on an electric typewriter in junior high and was hooked. At least one high school teacher thought his writing had promise and circulated one of his essays to the entire staff. Jay paid the bills in college by working in a bookstore. He got his undergraduate degree in writing and later, his Master’s. After graduation, Jay took a job in publishing. During his years at HarperCollins in New York he worked on bestselling titles like <i class="calibre6">Body for Life</i> by Bill Phillips and <i class="calibre6">Go for the Goal</i> by Mia Hamm. More recently, in the ten years he’s worked with Gary, Jay has coauthored numerous award-winning or bestselling titles, including the Millionaire Real Estate series.</p>
<p class="ind">Jay is passionate about sharing the ideas in his books and regularly speaks at conventions and training events. He is a member of the Keller Williams University International Master Faculty.</p>
<p class="ind">Outside of work, Jay co-owns a successful real estate investment business and sales team with his wife Wendy. They enjoy life in Austin, Texas, with their children Gus and Veronica.</p>
