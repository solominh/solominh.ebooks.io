<h1 class="chaptitle" id="chap4"><a id="page32" class="pcalibre3 calibre5 pcalibre pcalibre1 pcalibre2"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span> EVERYTHING MATTERS EQUALLY</h1>
<div class="float_first">
	<p class="right1"><big class="sanspink1">“Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.”</big></p>
	<p class="right1"><i class="sansgray2">—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Equality is a worthy ideal pursued in the name of justice and human rights. In the real world of results, however, things are never equal. No matter how teachers grade—two students are not equal. No matter how fair officials try to be—contests are not equal. No matter how talented people are—no two are ever equal. A dime equals ten cents and people must absolutely be treated fairly, but in the world of achievement everything doesn’t matter equally.</p>
<p class="ind" id="page33"><span class="grayunderline">Equality is a lie.</span></p>
<p class="ind">Understanding this is the basis of all great decisions.</p>
<p class="ind">So, how do you decide? When you have a lot to get done in the day, how do you decide what to do first? As kids, we mostly did things we needed to do when it was time to do them. <i class="calibre6">It’s breakfast time. It’s time to go to school, time to do homework, time to do chores, bath time, bedtime.</i> Then, as we got older, we were given a measure of discretion. <i class="calibre6">You can go out and play as long as you get your homework done before dinner.</i> Later, as we became adults, everything became discretionary. It all became our choice. And when our lives are defined by our choices, the all-important question becomes, How do we make good ones?</p>
<p class="ind">Complicating matters, the older we get, it seems there is more and more piled on that we believe “simply must get done.” Overbooked, overextended, and overcommitted. “In the weeds” overwhelmingly becomes our collective condition.</p>
<p class="ind">That’s when the battle for the right of way gets fierce and frantic. Lacking a clear formula for making decisions, we get reactive and fall back on familiar, comfortable ways to decide what to do. As a result, we haphazardly select approaches that undermine our success. Pinballing through our day like a confused character in a B-horror movie, we end up running up the stairs instead of out the front door. The best decision gets traded for any decision, and what should be progress simply becomes a trap.</p>
<p class="ind">When everything feels urgent and important, everything seems equal. We become active and busy, but this doesn’t actually move us any closer to success. Activity is often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business.</p>
<div class="float" id="page34">
	<p class="right1"><big class="sanspink1">“The things which are most important don’t always scream the loudest.”</big></p>
	<p class="right1"><i class="sansgray2">—Bob Hawke</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind">As Henry David Thoreau said, “It’s not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about?” Knocking out a hundred tasks for whatever the reason is a poor substitute for doing even one task that’s meaningful. Not everything matters equally, and success isn’t a game won by whoever does the most. Yet that is exactly how most play it on a daily basis.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">MUCH TO-DO ABOUT NOTHING</h3>
<p class="noind1">To-do lists are a staple of the time-management-and-success industry. With our wants and others’ wishes flying at us right and left, we impulsively jot them down on scraps of paper in moments of clarity or build them methodically on printed notepads. Time planners reserve valuable space for daily, weekly, and monthly task lists. Apps abound for taking to-dos mobile, and software programs code them right into their menus. It seems that everywhere we turn we’re encouraged to make lists—and though lists are invaluable, they have a dark side.</p>
<p class="ind">While to-dos serve as a useful collection of our best intentions, they also tyrannize us with trivial, unimportant stuff that we feel obligated to get done—because it’s on our list. Which is why most of us have a love-hate relationship with our to-dos. If allowed, they set our priorities the same way an inbox can dictate our day. Most inboxes overflow with unimportant e-mails masquerading as priorities. Tackling these tasks in the order we receive them is behaving as if the squeaky wheel immediately deserves the grease. But, as Australian prime minister Bob Hawke duly noted, “The things which are most important don’t always scream the loudest.”</p>
<p class="ind" id="page35">Achievers operate differently. They have an eye for the essential. They pause just long enough to decide what matters and then allow what matters to drive their day. Achievers do sooner what others plan to do later and defer, perhaps indefinitely, what others do sooner. The difference isn’t in intent, but in right of way. <span class="grayunderline">Achievers always work from a clear sense of priority.</span></p>
<p class="ind">Left in its raw state, as a simple inventory, a to-do list can easily lead you astray. A to-do list is simply the things you think you need to do; the first thing on your list is just the first thing you thought of. To-do lists inherently lack the intent of success. In fact, most to-do lists are actually just survival lists—getting you through your day and your life, but not making each day a stepping-stone for the next so that you sequentially build a successful life. Long hours spent checking off a to-do list and ending the day with a full trash can and a clean desk are not virtuous and have nothing to do with success. Instead of a to-do list, you need a success list—a list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results.</p>
<p class="ind">To-do lists tend to be long; success lists are short. One pulls you in all directions; the other aims you in a specific direction. One is a disorganized directory and the other is an organized directive. If a list isn’t built around success, then that’s not where it takes you. If your to-do list contains everything, then it’s probably taking you everywhere but where you really want to go.</p>
<p class="ind">So how does a successful person turn a to-do list into a success list? With so many things you <i class="calibre6">could</i> do, how do you decide what matters most at any given moment on any given day?</p>
<p class="ind">Just follow Juran’s lead.</p>
<h3 class="subhead" id="page36">JURAN CRACKS THE CODE</h3>
<p class="noind1">In the late ’30s a group of managers at General Motors made an intriguing discovery that opened the door for an amazing breakthrough. One of their card readers (input devices for early computers) started producing gibberish. While investigating the faulty machine, they stumbled on a way to encode secret messages. This was a big deal at the time. Since Germany’s infamous Enigma coding machines first appeared in World War I, both code making and code breaking were the stuff of high national security and even higher public curiosity. The GM managers quickly became convinced that their accidental cipher was unbreakable. One man, a visiting Western Electric consultant, disagreed. He took up the code-breaking challenge, worked into the night, and cracked the code by three o’clock the following morning. His name was Joseph M. Juran.</p>
<p class="ind">Juran later cited this incident as the starting point for cracking an even bigger code and making one of his greatest contributions to science and business. As a result of his deciphering success, a GM executive invited him to review research on management compensation that followed a formula described by a little-known Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto. In the 19th century, Pareto had written a mathematical model for income distribution in Italy that stated that 80 percent of the land was owned by 20 percent of the people. Wealth was not evenly distributed. In fact, according to Pareto, it was actually concentrated in a highly predictable way. A pioneer of quality-control management, Juran had noticed that a handful of flaws would usually produce a majority of the defects. This imbalance not only rang true to his experience, but he suspected it might even be a universal<a id="page37" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> law—and that what Pareto had observed might be bigger than even Pareto had imagined.</p>
<p class="ind">While writing his seminal book <i class="calibre6">Quality Control Handbook,</i> Juran wanted to give a short name to the concept of the “vital few and trivial many.” One of the many illustrations in his manuscript was labeled “Pareto’s principle of unequal distribution... .” Where another might have called it Juran’s Rule, he called it Pareto’s Principle.</p>
<p class="ind">Pareto’s Principle, it turns out, is as real as the law of gravity, and yet most people fail to see the gravity of it. It’s not just a theory—it is a provable, predictable certainty of nature and one of the greatest productivity truths ever discovered. Richard Koch, in his book <i class="calibre6">The 80/20 Principle,</i> defined it about as well as anyone: “The 80/20 Principle asserts that a minority of causes, inputs, or effort usually lead to a majority of the results, outputs, or rewards.” In other words, in the world of success, things aren’t equal. A small amount of causes creates most of the results. Just the right input creates most of the output. Selected effort creates almost all of the rewards.</p>
<p class="figimage"><img alt="image" src="TheOneThing00361.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="fig" id="fig3"><span class="fignum">FIG. 3</span> The 80/20 Principle says the minority of your effort leads to the majority of your results.</p>
<p class="ind" id="page38">Pareto points us in a very clear direction: <span class="grayunderline">the majority of what you want will come from the minority of what you do.</span> Extraordinary results are disproportionately created by fewer actions than most realize.</p>
<p class="ind">Don’t get hung up on the numbers. Pareto’s truth is about inequality, and though often stated as an 80/20 ratio, it can actually take a variety of proportions. Depending on the circumstances, it can easily play out as, say, 90/20, where 90 percent of your success comes from 20 percent of your effort. Or 70/10 or 65/5. But understand that these are all fundamentally working off the same principle. Juran’s great insight was that not everything matters equally; some things matter more than others—a lot more. A to-do list becomes a success list when you apply Pareto’s Principle to it.</p>
<p class="figimage"><img alt="image" src="TheOneThing00371.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="fig" id="fig4"><span class="fignum">FIG. 4</span> A to-do list becomes a success list when you prioritize it.</p>
<p class="ind">The 80/20 Principle has been one of the most important guiding success rules in my career. It describes the<a id="page39" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> phenomenon which, like Juran, I’ve observed in my own life over and over again. A few ideas gave me most of my results. Some clients were far more valuable than others; a small number of people created most of my business success; and a handful of investments put the most money in my pocket. Everywhere I turned, the concept of unequal distribution popped up. The more it showed up, the more I paid attention—and the more I paid attention, the more it showed up. Finally I quit thinking it was a coincidence and began to apply it as the absolute principle of success that it is—not only to my life, but also in working with everyone else, as well. And the results were extraordinary.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">EXTREME PARETO</h3>
<p class="noind1">Pareto proves everything I’m telling you—but there’s a catch. He doesn’t go far enough. I want you to go further. I want you to take Pareto’s Principle to an extreme. I want you to go small by identifying the 20 percent, and then I want you to go even smaller by finding the vital few of the vital few. The 80/20 rule is the first word, but not the last, about success. What Pareto started, you’ve got to finish. Success requires that you follow the 80/20 Principle, but you don’t have to stop there.</p>
<p class="figimage"><img alt="image" src="TheOneThing00381.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="fig" id="fig5"><span class="fignum">FIG. 5</span> No matter how many to-dos you start with, you can always narrow it to one.</p>
<p class="ind" id="page40">Keep going. You can actually take 20 percent of the 20 percent of the 20 percent and continue until you get to the single most important thing! (See figure 5.) No matter the task, mission, or goal. Big or small. Start with as large a list as you want, but develop the mindset that you will whittle your way from there to the critical few and not stop until you end with the essential ONE. The imperative ONE. The ONE Thing.</p>
<p class="ind">In 2001, I called a meeting of our key executive team. As fast as we were growing, we were still not acknowledged by the very top people in our industry. I challenged our group to brainstorm 100 ways to turn this situation around. It took us all day to come up with the list. The next morning, we narrowed the list down to ten ideas, and from there we chose just one big idea. The one that we decided on was that I would write a book on how to become an elite performer in our industry. It worked. Eight years later that one book had not only become a national bestseller, but also had morphed into a series of books with total sales of over a million copies. In an industry of about a million people, one thing changed our image forever.</p>
<p class="ind">Now, again, stop and do the math. One idea out of 100. That is Pareto to the extreme. That’s thinking big, but going very small. That’s applying the ONE Thing to a business challenge in a truly powerful way.</p>
<p class="ind">But this doesn’t just apply to business. On my 40th birthday, I started taking guitar lessons and quickly discovered I could give only 20 minutes a day to practice. This wasn’t much, so I knew I had to narrow down what I learned. I asked my friend Eric Johnson (one of the greatest guitarists<a id="page41" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a> ever) for advice. Eric said that if I could do only one thing, then I should practice my scales. So, I took his advice and chose the minor blues scale. What I discovered was that if I learned that scale, then I could play many of the solos of great classic rock guitarists from Eric Clapton to Billy Gibbons and, maybe someday, even Eric Johnson. That scale became my ONE Thing for the guitar, and it unlocked the world of rock ’n’ roll for me.</p>
<p class="ind">The inequality of effort for results is everywhere in your life if you will simply look for it. And if you apply this principle, it will unlock the success you seek in anything that matters to you. There will always be just a few things that matter more than the rest, and out of those, one will matter most. Internalizing this concept is like being handed a magic compass. Whenever you feel lost or lacking direction, you can pull it out to remind yourself to discover what matters most.</p>

	<h3 class="subheadpink">BIG IDEAS</h3>
</div>
<ol class="calibre10">
	<li class="calibre9"><b class="sans1">Go small.</b> Don’t focus on being busy; focus on being productive. Allow what matters most to drive your day.</li>
	<li class="calibre9"><b class="sans1">Go extreme.</b> Once you’ve figured out what actually matters, keep asking what matters most until there is only one thing left. That core activity goes at the top of your success list.</li>
	<li class="calibre9"><b class="sans1">Say no.</b> Whether you say “later” or “never,” the point is to say “not now” to anything else you could do until your most important work is done.</li>
	<li class="calibre9"><a id="page42" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3 pcalibre2"></a><b class="sans1">Don’t get trapped in the “check off” game.</b> If we believe things don’t matter equally, we must act accordingly. We can’t fall prey to the notion that everything has to be done, that checking things off our list is what success is all about. We can’t be trapped in a game of “check off” that never produces a winner. The truth is that things don’t matter equally and success is found in doing what matters most.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ind">Sometimes it’s the first thing you do. Sometimes it’s the only thing you do. Regardless, <span class="grayunderline">doing the most important thing is always the most important thing.</span></p>
