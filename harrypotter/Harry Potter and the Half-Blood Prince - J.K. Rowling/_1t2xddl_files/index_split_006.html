<p class="calibre1">Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all . . . and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” he said. “Really excellent. Right . . . I’m going down to Hagrid’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Harry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry confidently. “I’m going to Hagrid’s, I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked Ron, looking stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 477  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p492"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This  <i class="calibre3">is</i> Felix Felicis, I suppose?” said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. “You haven’t got another little bottle full of— I don’t know —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Essence of Insanity?” suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trust me,” he said. “I know what I’m doing . . . or at least” — </p>
<p class="calibre1">he strolled confidently to the door — “Felix does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you doing up there with  <i class="calibre3">her</i>?” shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys’ dormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Don’t</i> push me, please, Dean,” she said, sounding annoyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort. . . . His feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest: This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why he knew that going to Hagrid’s was the right thing to do, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 478  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p493"></a>AFTER  THE  BURIAL </p>
<p class="calibre1">he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time: He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid’s. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,” Slughorn was saying courteously, “most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I quite agree,” said Professor Sprout warmly. “That enough for you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plenty, plenty,” said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. “This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 479  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p494"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Professor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merlin’s beard, Harry, you made me jump,” said Slughorn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. “How did you get out of the castle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think Filch must’ve forgotten to lock the doors,” said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll be reporting that man, he’s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out here, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wel ,  sir,  it’s  Hagrid,”  said  Harry,  who  knew  that  the  right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. “He’s pretty upset. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But you won’t tell anyone, Professor? I don’t want trouble for him. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn’s curiosity was evidently aroused. “Well, I can’t promise that,” he said gruffly. “But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I’m sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s this giant spider, he’s had it for years. . . . It lived in the forest. . . . It could talk and everything —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,” said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. “It’s true, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. “But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He’s devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said I’d go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Touching, touching,” said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid’s cabin. “But  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 480  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p495"></a>AFTER  THE  BURIAL </p>
<p class="calibre1">acromantula venom is very valuable . . . If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn’t want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset . . . but if there was any way to procure some . . . I mean, it’s almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it’s alive. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . seems an awful waste not to collect it . . . might get a hundred Galleons a pint. . . . To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, “well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better send-off, you know . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm. “I tell you what, Harry, I’ll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . We’ll drink the poor beast’s — well — not health — but we’ll send it off in style, anyway, once it’s buried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I’ll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occasion. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid’s, delighted with himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh came,” croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re really sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’ — don’ matter . . . He’d’ve bin touched yeh’re here, though, Harry. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 481  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p496"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO </p>
<p class="calibre1">were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are we burying him?” he asked. “The forest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, no,” said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt. “The other spiders won’ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog’s gone. Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” said Hagrid, shaking his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give ’im a nice burial . . . a proper send-off . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), “Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 482  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p497"></a>AFTER  THE  BURIAL </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said Hagrid in a choked voice. “I’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave. Jus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">thought we’d say a few nice things over him — happy memories, yeh know —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid,” he said, in a deep, grave voice. “So very sorry to hear of your loss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tha’s very nice of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Thanks a lot. An’ thanks fer not givin’ Harry detention neither. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said Slughorn. “Sad night, sad night . . . Where is the poor creature?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out here,” said Hagrid in a shaking voice. “Shall we — shall we do it, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 483  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p498"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO </p>
<p class="calibre1">with the light spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spider’s head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” said Hagrid to Slughorn’s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. “I didn’ know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said Slughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. “Now . . . shall we proceed to the burial?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid started to cry again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” said Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid’s elbow, but patted it all the same. “Why don’t I say a few words?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget! Though your body will decay, your  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 484  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p499"></a>AFTER  THE  BURIAL </p>
<p class="calibre1">spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tha’ was . . . tha’ was . . . beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. “Let’s get inside and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry. . . . That’s it. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry’s lap as usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have had it  <i class="calibre3">all</i> tested for poison,” he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid’s bucket-sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. “Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw, in his mind’s eye, the expression on Hermione’s face if she ever heard about this abuse of house-elves, and decided never to mention it to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One for Harry . . .” said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two mugs, “. . . and one for me. Well” — he raised his mug high — “to Aragog.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 485  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p500"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO </p>
<p class="calibre1">must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. ’Bout the size of a Pekingese.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sweet,” said Slughorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">well . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright white hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yeah,” said Hagrid indifferently. “Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an’ stuff in the forest, yeh know . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s  <i class="calibre3">worth</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I use it fer bindin’ on bandages an’ stuff if a creature gets injured,” said Hagrid, shrugging. “It’s dead useful . . . very strong, see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak-matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smoking jackets. He refilled Hagrid’s mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and Slughorn’s flattering interest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 486  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p501"></a>AFTER  THE  BURIAL </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extrav-agant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elf-made wine, and to — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry  Potter!”  bel owed  Hagrid,  slopping  some  of  his  fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, indeed,” cried Slughorn a little thickly, “Parry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who — well — something of that sort,” he mumbled, and drained his mug too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaargh, the good die young,” muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while Slughorn continued to war-ble the refrain. “Me dad was no age ter go . . . nor were yer mum an’ dad, Harry. . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid’s crinkled eyes again; he grasped Harry’s arm and shook it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 487  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p502"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bes’ wiz and witchard o’ their age I never knew . . . terrible thing . . . terrible thing . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And Odo the hero, they bore him back home</i> <i class="calibre3">To the place that he’d known as a lad,</i> sang Slughorn plaintively. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">They laid him to rest with his hat inside out</i> <i class="calibre3">And his wand snapped in two, which was sad. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . terrible,” Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,” said Slughorn with a hiccup. “Can’t carry a tune to save my life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said Harry quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was talking about my mum and dad dying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. “Oh dear. Yes, that was — was terrible indeed. Terrible . . . terrible . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their mugs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry?” he asked awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid’s heavy snores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I’ve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 488  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p503"></a>AFTER  THE  BURIAL </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harry’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He told her to get out of the way,” said Harry remorselessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He told me she needn’t have died. He only wanted me. She could have run.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh dear,” breathed Slughorn. “She could have . . . she needn’t </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . That’s awful. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is, isn’t it?” said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But she didn’t move. Dad was already dead, but she didn’t want me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort . . . but he just laughed. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s enough!” said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking hand. “Really, my dear boy, enough . . . I’m an old man . . . I don’t need to hear . . . I don’t want to hear . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I forgot,” lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. “You liked her, didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liked her?” said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more. “I don’t imagine anyone who met her wouldn’t have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funny . . . It was the most horrible thing. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you won’t help her son,” said Harry. “She gave me her life, but you won’t give me a memory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily into Slughorn’s tear-filled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t say that,” he whispered. “It isn’t a question . . . If it were to help you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It can,” said Harry clearly. “Dumbledore needs information. I need information.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  <i class="calibre3">are</i> the Chosen One?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course I am,” said Harry calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then . . . my dear boy . . . you’re asking a great deal . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, Harry, of course I do, but —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be brave like my mother, Professor. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not proud . . .” he whispered through his fingers. “I am ashamed of what — of what that memory shows. . . . I think I may have done great damage that day. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Harry. “It would be a very brave and noble thing to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harry’s eyes, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p505"></a>AFTER  THE  BURIAL </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much, Professor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re a good boy,” said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache. “And you’ve got her eyes. . . . Just don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep. </p>

The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What sort of time do you call this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m really sorry — I had to go out for something important —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, the password changed at midnight, so you’ll just have to sleep in the corridor, won’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re joking!” said Harry. “Why did it have to change at midnight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s the way it is,” said the Fat Lady. “If you’re angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he’s the one who’s tightened security.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p507"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fantastic,” said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he’s the one who wanted me to —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He is here,” said a voice behind Harry. “Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,” said Nick. “He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is he?” said Harry, his heart leaping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it’s a favorite pastime of his —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh — in his office,” said Nick. “I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, he has,” said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The password’s still ‘tapeworm’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying “toffee éclairs” to Dumbledore’s gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enter,” said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore’s office, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 493  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p508"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good gracious, Harry,” said Dumbledore in surprise. “To what do I owe this very late pleasure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn’s memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And now,” said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. “Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn’s office many years before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo’s gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 494  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p509"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, “Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the boys tittered again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have  <i class="calibre3">excellent</i> contacts at the Ministry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know that politics would suit me, sir,” he said when the laughter had died away. “I don’t have the right kind of background, for one thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader’s famous ancestor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense,” said Slughorn briskly, “couldn’t be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you’ll go far, Tom, I’ve never been wrong about a student yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 495  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p510"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock behind him and he looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good gracious, is it that time already? You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look sharp, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not exactly, sir,” said Riddle. “I came across the term while reading and I didn’t fully understand it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No . . . well . . . you’d be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that’ll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,” said Slughorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you — sorry, I mean, if you can’t tell me, obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could — so I just thought I’d ask —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 496  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p511"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t quite understand how that works, though, sir,” said Riddle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn’s face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: “<i class="calibre3">I was ripped from</i> <i class="calibre3">my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost </i>. . .  <i class="calibre3"> but still,</i> <i class="calibre3">I was alive. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Riddle’s hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you split your soul?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must understand </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 497  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p512"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how do you do it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creat-ing a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Encase? But how — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry . . . I didn’t mean to offend . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn gruffly. “It’s natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, though — just out of curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn’t  it  be  better,  make  you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn’t seven — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merlin’s beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Seven! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 498  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p513"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” he muttered, “this is all hypothetical, what we’re discussing, isn’t it? All academic . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir, of course,” said Riddle quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I’ve told — that’s to say, what we’ve discussed. People wouldn’t like to think we’ve been chatting about Horcruxes. It’s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I won’t say a word, sir,” said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Let us go. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,” said Dumbledore at last. “It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tel s me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 499  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p514"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think he succeeded then, sir?” asked Harry. “He made a Horcrux? And that’s why he didn’t die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A bit . . . or more,” said Dumbledore. “You heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No book would have given him that information. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then said, “Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” asked Harry “How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You handed it to me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “The diary, Riddle’s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t understand, sir,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 500  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p515"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I still don’t understand,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin’s monster would be unleashed again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, he didn’t want his hard work to be wasted,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He wanted people to know he was Slytherin’s heir, because he couldn’t take credit at the time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite correct,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “But don’t you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blasé about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else’s path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. ‘ <i class="calibre3">I, who have gone further than</i> <i class="calibre3">anybody along the path that leads to immortality. </i>’ That was what you told me he said. ‘ <i class="calibre3">Further than anybody, </i>’ And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 501  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p516"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’ . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?” said Harry. “Why couldn’t he make a Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,” said Dumbledore. “But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer’s Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain their immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to  continue  to  rely  on  his  Horcruxes:  He  would  need  nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You heard him, Harry: ‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 502  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p517"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number . . .’  <i class="calibre3">Isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He made  <i class="calibre3">seven</i> Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. “But they could be anywhere in the world — </p>
<p class="calibre1">hidden — buried or invisible —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Dumbledore calmly “But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But the six Horcruxes, then,” said Harry, a little desperately, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“how are we supposed to find them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I have destroyed another.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have?” said Harry eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. “The ring, Harry. Marvolo’s ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape’s timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort’s soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 503  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p518"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how did you find it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort’s past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts’ house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And they could be anything?” said Harry. “They could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The diary wasn’t that special.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know what they are, sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff’s cup!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — </p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw’s. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think that’s why he real y wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?” said Harry. “To try and find something from one of the other founders?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My thoughts precisely,” said Dumbledore. “But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 505  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p520"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders’ objects. He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of Gryffindor’s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,” said Harry, counting on his fingers. “Unless he got both?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore. “I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The snake?” said Harry, startled. “You can use animals as Horcruxes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it is inadvisable to do so,” said Dumbledore, “because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calcula-tions are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents’ house with the intention of killing you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort’s mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 506  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p521"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,” said Dumbledore, bowing his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you’ve been going when you’ve been leaving the school?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Correct,” said Dumbledore. “I have been looking for a very long time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And if you do,” said Harry quickly, “can I come with you and help get rid of it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, “Yes, I think so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can?” said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I think you have earned that right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore’s decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?” Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 507  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p522"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort’s say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master’s soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley’s daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort’s fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort  <i class="calibre3">could </i> be killed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 508  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p523"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said Harry, before he could stop himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, you have,” said Dumbledore firmly. “You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know!” said Harry impatiently. “I can love!” It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, “Big deal!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Harry, you can love,” said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. “Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, when the prophecy says that I’l  have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not,’ it just means — love?” asked Harry, feeling a little let down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — </p>
<p class="calibre1">and in doing so, he  <i class="calibre3">made</i> you the person who would be most dangerous to him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it comes to the same —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it doesn’t!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, “You are setting too much store by the prophecy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 509  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p524"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” said Harry, bewildered, “but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is essential that you understand this!” said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. “By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort’s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 510  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p525"></a>HORCRUXES </p>
<p class="calibre1">language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort’s world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort’s followers!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course I haven’t!” said Harry indignantly. “He killed my mum and dad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said Dumbledore loudly. “The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort’s! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort’s mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argu-mentative, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn’t it? I’ve got to try and kill him, or —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you’ve got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you’ve tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 511  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p526"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE </p>
<p class="calibre1">that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I’d want to do it.” “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you  <i class="calibre3">have</i> to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to  <i class="calibre3">mark you as his equal. </i>. . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew —  <i class="calibre3">and so do I, </i> thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride,  <i class="calibre3">and so did my parents</i> — that there was all the difference in the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">xhausted but delighted with his night’s work, Harry told E Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during next morning’s Charms lesson (having first cast the  <i class="calibre3">Muffliato</i> spell upon those nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemort’s Horcruxes and Dumbledore’s promise to take Harry along, should he find another one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,” said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing. “Wow. You’re actually going to go with Dumbledore </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . and try and destroy . . . wow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, you’re making it snow,” said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender </p>

<p class="calibre1">Brown, Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Hermione immediately let go of Ron’s arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah,” said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. “Sorry . . . looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff now. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione’s shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn’t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Harry. “Well — you don’t mind it’s over, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” Ron admitted. “It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. “Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldn’t climb in herself . . . but they’ve been a bit rocky for ages.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He certainly looked unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 514  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p529"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn’t it?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Quidditch team,” said Hermione. “If Ginny and Dean aren’t speaking . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh — oh yeah,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Flitwick,” said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry’s and Ron’s were still murky brown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, now, boys,” squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. “A little less talk, a little more action . . . Let me see you try. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Harry’s vinegar turned to ice; Ron’s flask exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes . . . for homework,” said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, “<i class="calibre3">practice. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, “It’s a nice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harry’s brain: </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">She’s Ron’s sister. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But she’s ditched Dean! </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p530"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">She’s still Ron’s sister. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m his best mate! </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">That’ll make it worse. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I talked to him first — </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He’d hit you. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What if I don’t care? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He’s your best mate</i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, “Katie! You’re back! Are you okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m really well!” she said happily. “They let me out of St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mungo’s on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match, Harry. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, “well, now you’re back and Ron’s fit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as Katie’s friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. “Everyone’s been asking me, but I haven’t got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies’ in the Three Broomsticks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You definitely went into the bathroom, then?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 516  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p531"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I know I pushed open the door,” said Katie, “so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my memory’s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo’s. Listen, I’d better go, I wouldn’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,” said Hermione, “to be in the ladies’ bathroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got stolen. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“and have a go at the Room of Requirement again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said Hermione flatly, putting down the copy of  <i class="calibre3">Spellman’s Syllabary</i> she had just taken out of her bag. “Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luck isn’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion! You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him . . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione. “It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 517  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p532"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled his copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making</i> out of his bag and looked up Felix Felicis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. “And it takes six months . . . You’ve got to let it stew. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Typical,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the  <i class="calibre3">Sectumsempra</i> spell, captioned “For Enemies,” that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fil  her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imita-tions of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 518  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p533"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">innocent  reason  to  look  at  Ginny;  he  had  received  several  more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle still raged inside his head:  <i class="calibre3">Ginny or Ron</i>? Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron’s expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around — but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione’s help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, “tweaking the circumstances”? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry’s shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer </p>

<p class="calibre1">than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry’s mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what  Malfoy  was  up  to  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 520  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p535"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder’s Map, and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder’s Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy’s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of the cubicles. “Don’t . . . tell me what’s wrong . . . I can help you. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 521  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p536"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one can help me,” said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. “I can’t do it. . . . I can’t. . . . It won’t work . . . and unless I do it soon . . . he says he’ll kill me. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying — actually crying — tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy’s hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought  <i class="calibre3">Levicorpus</i>! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No! No! Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. “Stop! STOP!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoy’s ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, “<i class="calibre3">Cruci</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">SECTUMSEMPRA</i>!” bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood spurted from Malfoy’s face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No —” gasped Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 522  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p537"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No — I didn’t —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: “MURDER! </p>
<p class="calibre1">MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Harry’s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy’s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy into a standing position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that. . . . Come. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, “And you, Potter . . . You wait here for me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 523  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p538"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go,” he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t mean it to happen,” said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. “I didn’t know what that spell did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Snape ignored this. “Apparently I underestimated you, Potter,” he said quietly. “Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — read about it somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was — a library book,” Harry invented wildly. “I can’t remember what it was call —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liar,” said Snape. Harry’s throat went dry. He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block out all thought, but try as he might, the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making</i> swam hazily to the fore-front of his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into Snape’s black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring me your schoolbag,” said Snape softly, “and all of your schoolbooks.  <i class="calibre3">All</i> of them. Bring them to me here. Now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 524  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p539"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walking the other way; they gaped at him, drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly  savage;  what  had  the  Prince  been  thinking  to  copy  such  a spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would he tell Slughorn — Harry’s stomach churned — how Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could not let it happen. . . . He could not . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’ve you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that  <i class="calibre3">blood</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at the sight of Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need your book,” Harry panted. “Your Potions book. Quick </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . give it to me . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what about the Half-Blood —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll explain later!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron pulled his copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making</i> out of his bag and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I need a place to hide my book. </i> . . .  <i class="calibre3"> I need a place to hide my book. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">. . .  <i class="calibre3"> I need a place to hide my book. </i> . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 525  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p540"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung himself inside, and slammed it shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-proud house-elves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard’s creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 526  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p541"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Half-Blood Prince’s book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue’s head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ron’s copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making</i> into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand wordlessly for Harry’s schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One by one, Snape extracted Harry’s books and examined them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is your copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making, </i> is it, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry, still breathing hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry, with a touch more defiance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is the copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making</i> that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then why,” asked Snape, “does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s heart missed a beat. “That’s my nickname,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 527  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p542"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your nickname,” repeated Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah . . . that’s what my friends call me,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand what a nickname is,” said Snape. The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harry’s; he tried not to look into them.  <i class="calibre3">Close your mind. </i> . . .  <i class="calibre3">Close your mind. </i> . . . But he had never learned how to do it properly. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know what I think, Potter?” said Snape, very quietly. “I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. What do you think, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — I don’t agree, sir,” said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape’s eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,” said Snape. “Ten o’clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But sir . . .” said Harry, looking up desperately. “Quidditch . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">the last match of the . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. “Poor Gryffindor . . . fourth place this year, I fear . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I won’t say ‘I told you so,’ ” said Hermione, an hour later in the common room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leave it, Hermione,” said Ron angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 528  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p543"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape’s punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. “And I was right, wasn’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I don’t think you were,” said Harry stubbornly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team’s faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could feel Ginny’s eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the post-match euphoria. . . . The thought went through Harry like an icy knife. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up for that book when that spell —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Prince only copied it out! It’s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 529  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p544"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without the Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione nastily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. “By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said Hermione, clearly stung. “But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it’s landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing what this has done to your chances in the match —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, don’t start acting as though you understand Quidditch,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped Ginny, “you’ll only embarrass yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 530  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p545"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Potter,” said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cob-webbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,” said Snape softly. “They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 531  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p546"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You will not use magic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right, Professor,” said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought you could start,” said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, “with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, “ ‘ <i class="calibre3">James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an</i> <i class="calibre3">illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubrey’s head twice normal size. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Double detention. </i>’ ”  <i class="calibre3">  </i> Snape sneered. “It must be such a comfort to think that, though they are gone, a record of their great achieve-ments remains. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach  that  meant  he  had  just  read  his  father  or  Sirius’s  names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wal . It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an hour . . . an hour . . . an hour and a half. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 532  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p547"></a>SECTUMSEMPRA </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think that will do,” he said coldly. “Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o’clock next Saturday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. . . . It was over, then. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Quid agis</i>?” he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her expression was unreadable as she replied, “You’ll see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she swung forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We won!” yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. “We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. The </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 533  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p548"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry’s eyes sought Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean,  <i class="calibre3">Well  </i>—   <i class="calibre3">if you</i> <i class="calibre3">must. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which — if they had time — they might discuss the match. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE SEER OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">he fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny T Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervi-ous to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d think people had better things to gossip about,” said Ginny, as she sat on the common room floor, leaning against Harry’s legs and reading the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet. </i> “Three dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What did you tell her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told her it’s a Hungarian Horntail,” said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. “Much more macho.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning. “And what did you tell her Ron’s got?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Watch it,” he said, pointing warningly at Harry and Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just because I’ve given my permission doesn’t mean I can’t withdraw it —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘ <i class="calibre3">Your permission, </i>’ ”  <i class="calibre3"> </i> scoffed Ginny. “Since when did you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself you’d rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I would,” said Ron grudgingly. “And just as long as you don’t start snogging each other in public —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place?” demanded Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Ron’s tolerance was not to be  tested  much  as  they  moved into June, for Harry and Ginny’s time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginny’s O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to study for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library, and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunch-time, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to talk to you, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about?” said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 536  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p551"></a>THE  SEER  OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The so-called Half-Blood Prince.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, not again,” he groaned. “Will you please drop it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince’s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until you’ve heard me out. Now, I’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He didn’t make a hobby of it —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He, he — who says it’s a he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly. “<i class="calibre3">Prince, </i> Hermione,  <i class="calibre3">Prince</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right!” said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry. “Look at that! Look at the picture!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face. Underneath the photograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 537  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p552"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?” said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her name was Eileen Prince.  <i class="calibre3">Prince, </i> Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think  <i class="calibre3">she</i> was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,” said Hermione angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It’s the way he writes, I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it. Where did you get this anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a whole collection of old  <i class="calibre3">Prophets</i> up there. Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” she shot </p>

<p class="calibre1">at him, as she reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron, returning to his copy of  <i class="calibre3">A Thousand Magical Herbs and</i> <i class="calibre3">Fungi. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t think I’m mad, wanting that book back, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Course not,” said Ron robustly. “He was a genius, the Prince. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway . . . without his bezoar tip . . .” He drew his finger significantly across his own throat. “I wouldn’t  be  here  to  discuss  it, would I? I mean, I’m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nor am I,” said Harry quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in no time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same. “Thanks to Snape . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?” Ron continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">sighed Harry. “And he’s hinting now that if I don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we’ll carry on next year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 539  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p554"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, Jimmy . . . Hey, it’s from Dumbledore!” said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. “He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stared at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey,” whispered Ron. “You don’t reckon . . . he hasn’t found . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said Harry, jumping to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry’s defensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How —  <i class="calibre3">dare</i> — you — aaaaargh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted toward it, his wand at the ready, hurtled around another corner, and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hurried forward and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccuped loudly, patted her hair, and pulled herself up on Harry’s helping arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 540  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p555"></a>THE  SEER  OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What happened, Professor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You may well ask!” she said shrilly. “I was strolling along, brooding upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry was not paying much attention. He had just noticed where they were standing: There on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls, and on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . omens I have been vouchsafed — what?” She looked suddenly shifty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Room of Requirement,” repeated Harry. “Were you trying to get in there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — well — I didn’t know students knew about —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not all of them do,” said Harry. “But what happened? You screamed. . . . It sounded as though you were hurt. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — well,” said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. “I wished to — ah — deposit certain — um — personal items in the room. . . .” And she muttered something about “nasty accusations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. “But you couldn’t get in and hide them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He found this very odd; the room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince’s book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I got in all right,” said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. “But there was somebody already in there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Somebody in — ? Who?” demanded Harry. “Who was in there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 541  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p556"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have no idea,” said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry’s voice. “I walked into the room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding — of using the room, I mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A voice? Saying what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know that it was saying anything,” said Professor Trelawney. “It was . . . whooping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Whooping</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gleefully,” she said, nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was it male or female?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would hazard a guess at male,” said Professor Trelawney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And it sounded happy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very happy,” said Professor Trelawney sniffily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As though it was celebrating?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most definitely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then I called out ‘Who’s there?’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You couldn’t have found out who it was without asking?” Harry asked her, slightly frustrated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Inner Eye,” said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, “was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney’s Inner Eye all too often before. “And did the voice say who was there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it did not,” she said. “Everything went pitch-black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the room!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 542  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p557"></a>THE  SEER  OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  you  didn’t  see  that  coming?”  said  Harry,  unable  to  help himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch —” She stopped and glared at him suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you’d better tell Professor Dumbledore,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He ought to know Malfoy’s celebrating — I mean, that someone threw you out of the room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,” she said coldly. “I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show —” Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harry’s wrist. “Again and again, no matter how I lay them out —” And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls. “— the lightning-struck tower,” she whispered. “Calamity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disaster. Coming nearer all the time . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry again. “Well . . . I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice, and everything going dark and being thrown out of the room. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think so?” Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to see him right now,” said Harry. “I’ve got a meeting with him. We could go together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, well, in that case,” said Professor Trelawney with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles, and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue-and-white vase standing in a nearby niche. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 543  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p558"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I miss having you in my classes, Harry,” she said soulfully as they set off together. “You were never much of a Seer . . . but you were a wonderful Object . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney’s continual predictions of doom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am afraid,” she went on, “that the nag — I’m sorry, the centaur — knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him — one Seer to another — had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice rose rather hysterically, and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother’s gift. Those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry mumbled something indistinct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,” went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. “He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed. . . . I was staying at the Hog’s Head, which I do not advise, incidentally — bedbugs, dear boy — </p>
<p class="calibre1">but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room. He questioned me. . . . I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed toward Divination . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day . . . but then . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 544  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p559"></a>THE  SEER  OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I’m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been ap-prehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore — </p>
<p class="calibre1">you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes — Harry, dear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked back over her shoulder, having only just realized that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” she repeated uncertainly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps his face was white to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 545  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p560"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing else mattered to Harry just now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” said Professor Trelawney again. “Harry — I thought we were going to see the headmaster together?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You stay here,” said Harry through numb lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But dear . . . I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You stay here!” Harry repeated angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked alarmed as he ran past her, around the corner into Dumbledore’s corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore’s door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered, “Enter” after Harry had already flung himself into the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black traveling cloak in his arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the conversation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come . . . with you . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only if you wish it, of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledore’s office in the first place. “You’ve found one? You’ve found a Horcrux?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 546  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p561"></a>THE  SEER  OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: For several moments, Harry could not speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is natural to be afraid,” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not scared!” said Harry at once, and it was perfectly true; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. “Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not sure which it is — though I think we can rule out the snake — but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. “How is it protected?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore hesitated, then said, “Harry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m coming,” said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to show on Harry’s face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window and looked more closely at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What has happened to you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,” lied Harry promptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What has upset you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not upset.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you were never a good Occlumens —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 547  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p562"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">The word was the spark that ignited Harry’s fury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape!” he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. “Snape’s what’s happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was  <i class="calibre3">him, </i> he listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s expression did not change, but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing. “When did you find out about this?” he asked at last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just now!” said Harry, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself. “AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD </p>
<p class="calibre1">VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathing hard as though he was fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exer-cising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Please listen to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledore’s lined face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Snape made a terrible —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t tel  me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please let me finish.” Dumbledore waited until Harry had </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 548  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p563"></a>THE  SEER  OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">nodded curtly, then went on. “Professor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Voldemort’s employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawney’s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know — he had no possible way of knowing — which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven’t you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  <i class="calibre3">he’s</i> a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir?” said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. “And isn’t Voldemort convinced that Snape’s on his side, even now? Professor </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . how can you be  <i class="calibre3">sure</i> Snape’s on our side?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. At last he said, “I am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I don’t!” he said, as loudly as before. “He’s up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have discussed this, Harry,” said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again. “I have told you my views.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 549  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p564"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you haven’t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To what?” asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. “What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I . . . they’re up to something!” said Harry, and his hands curled into fists as he said it. “Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping, celebrating! He’s trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me, he’s fixed it at last and you’re about to just walk out of school without —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. “Do you think that I have once left the school un-protected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t —” mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, “Do you wish to come with me tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well, then: Listen.” Dumbledore drew himself up to his full height. “I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 550  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p565"></a>THE  SEER  OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">even such orders as ‘run,’ ‘hide,’ or ‘go back.’ Do I have your word?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — yes, of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I tell you to hide, you will do so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I tell you to flee, you will obey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I tell you to leave me and save yourself, you will do as I tell you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They looked at each other for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes’ time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby red glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. “What does he want?” Hermione said at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, are you okay?” she added anxiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m fine,” said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder’s Map and a pair of balled-up socks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got to be quick,” Harry panted. “Dumbledore thinks I’m getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 551  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p566"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly he told them where he was going and why. He did not pause either for Hermione’s gasps of horror or for Ron’s hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . so you see what this means?” Harry finished at a gallop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore won’t be here tonight, so Malfoy’s going to have another clear shot at whatever he’s up to.  <i class="calibre3">No, listen to me</i>!” he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. “I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here —” He shoved the Marauder’s Map into Hermione’s hands. “You’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to watch Snape too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the D.A., Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says he’s put extra protection in the school, but if Snape’s involved, he’ll know what Dumbledore’s protection is, and how to avoid it — but he won’t be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry —” began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t got time to argue,” said Harry curtly. “Take this as well —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He thrust the socks into Ron’s hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,” said Ron. “Er — why do I need socks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You need what’s wrapped in them, it’s the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say good-bye to her for me. I’d better go, Dumbledore’s waiting —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. “We don’t want it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to be facing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore,” said Harry. “I want to know you lot are okay. . . . Don’t look like that, Hermione, I’ll see you later. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 552  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p567"></a>THE  SEER  OVERHEARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out onto the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would like you to wear your cloak, please,” said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, “Very good. Shall we go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own traveling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still panting and sweating rather a lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?” Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,” said Dumbledore lightly. “I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog’s Head . . . or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one’s true destination.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water, and wood smoke from Hagrid’s cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor,” said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, “will we be Apparating?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “You can Apparate now, I believe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry, “but I haven’t got a license.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No matter,” said Dumbledore, “I can assist you again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 553  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p568"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked, and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and stay out!” shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. “Oh, hello, Albus . . . You’re out late . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening . . . forgive me, I’m off to the Hog’s Head. . . . No offense, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog’s Head’s sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will not be necessary for us to enter,” muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. “As long as nobody sees us go . . . now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three . . . One . . . two . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">three . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">arry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, H chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moon-lit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you think?” asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harry’s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They brought the kids from the orphanage here?” asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not here, precisely,” said Dumbledore. “There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 555  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p570"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Lumos, </i>” said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You will not object to getting a little wet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 556  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p571"></a>THE  CAVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore’s wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore’s wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the stil  and freezing air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 557  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p572"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” said Dumbledore after a moment or two. “We need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve d-done it!” said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harry’s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 558  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p573"></a>THE  CAVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledore’s concentration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, surely not. So crude.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it, Professor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I rather think,” said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, “that we are required to make payment to pass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Payment?” said Harry. “You’ve got to give the door something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Blood, if I am not much mistaken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Blood</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore expected. “The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .” said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,” said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor!” protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife. “I’ll do it, I’m —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not know what he was going to say — younger, fitter? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 559  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p574"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are very kind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy’s wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered rock  within  it  simply  vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After me, I think,” said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 560  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p575"></a>THE  CAVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor?” he said final y. “Do you think the Horcrux is here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, I’m sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We couldn’t . . . we couldn’t just try a Summoning Charm?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly we could,” said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. “Why don’t you do it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me? Oh . . . okay . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, “<i class="calibre3">Accio Horcrux</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry’s heart, however, was still pounding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you think that would happen, sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 561  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p576"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought  <i class="calibre3">something</i> would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we don’t know what the thing was,” said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What the things  <i class="calibre3">are, </i> you mean,” said Dumbledore. “I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh no . . . I think the Horcrux is in the  <i class="calibre3">middle. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I think so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha,” said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. “So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 562  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p577"></a>THE  CAVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oho,” said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore’s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore’s clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, “sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is . . . is this boat safe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort’s boat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 563  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p578"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why have they let us?” asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,” said Dumbledore. “I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he is right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It doesn’t look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?” </p>
