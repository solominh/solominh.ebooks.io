<p class="calibre1">“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girls’ dormitory without another word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn’s party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the Burrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed  </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron’s just now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls’ bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He held out her books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case. “Thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about that Ron Weasley. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” said Luna, as they set off down the corridor together. “But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 310  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a>THE  UNBREAKABLE  VOW </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. “So have you had a good term?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slughorn’s party? With you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry. “We’re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like . . . I mean . . .” He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. “I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don’t want to . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. “Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed right underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 311  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Potty asked Loony to go to the party</i>!  <i class="calibre3"> Potty lurves Loony</i>!  <i class="calibre3"> Potty</i> <i class="calibre3">luuuuurves Looooooony</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty loves Loony!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn’s party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You could’ve taken  <i class="calibre3">anyone</i>!” said Ron in disbelief over dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Anyone</i>! And you chose Loony Lovegood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t call her that, Ron,” snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. “I’m really glad you’re taking her, Harry, she’s so excited.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you have to imitate her for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She laughed at my mustache!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron’s neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,” said Harry. “How’re you? You’re staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 312  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a>THE  UNBREAKABLE  VOW </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” said Parvati. “That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn’t been anything since . . . Oh, hi, Hermione!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. “Are you going to Slughorn’s party tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, though, it sounds like it’s going to be really good. . . . You’re going, aren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— we’re going up to the party together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who  <i class="calibre3">almost</i>” — </p>
<p class="calibre1">she put a great deal of emphasis on the word — “became Gryffindor Keeper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, wide-eyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece of gossip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow, you like your Quidditch players, don’t you? First Krum, then McLaggen . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I like  <i class="calibre3">really good</i> Quidditch players,” Hermione corrected her, still smiling. “Well, see you . . . Got to go and get ready for the party. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 313  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. “Did you hear, there’s supposed to be a vampire coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the Minister of Magic?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. “Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father’s bizarre </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 314  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p329"></a>THE  UNBREAKABLE  VOW </p>
<p class="calibre1">views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn’s office was much larger than the usual teacher’s study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. “Come in, come in, so many people I’d like you to meet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of  <i class="calibre3">Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires</i> — </p>
<p class="calibre1">and, of course, his friend Sanguini.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 315  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry’s face. “I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, ‘ <i class="calibre3">Where is the biography of Harry Potter</i> <i class="calibre3">for which we have all been waiting</i>?’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er,” said Harry, “were you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. “But seriously” — his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t quite —  <i class="calibre3">Sanguini, stay here</i>!” added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. “Here, have a pasty,” said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand before turning his attention back to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and I’ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione!  <i class="calibre3">Hermione</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 316  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a>THE  UNBREAKABLE  VOW </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left Cormac,” she said. “Under the mistletoe,” she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her severely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione dispassionately. “I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">You considered Smith</i>?” said Harry, revolted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let’s go this way, we’ll be able to see him coming, he’s so tall. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. “I haven’t seen you in my classes lately. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. “Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">we share classes. . . . It’s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 317  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, “Let’s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think I’d stoop that low?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can ask out McLaggen —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. “I’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall apart again, and we’ll lose the next match —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys care about? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cormac hasn’t asked me one single question about myself, no, I’ve just been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen’ nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna’s conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. “The rumors! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stories! ‘The Chosen One’! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 318  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a>THE  UNBREAKABLE  VOW </p>
<p class="calibre1">have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most important!” said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney’s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I don’t think I’ve ever known such a natural at Potions!” said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you know — like his mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” hiccuped Slughorn happily. “I was just talking about Harry’s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. “You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death — </p>
<p class="calibre1">never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even you, Severus —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, Harry?” asked Slughorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 319  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said Snape, with the faintest sneer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry defiantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. “The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They’re working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, “I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did you issue him with an invitation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch’s grip, looking furious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “I was trying to gate-crash, happy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. “You’re in trouble, you are! Didn’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling’s out, unless you’ve got permission, didn’t he, eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said Slughorn, waving a </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 320  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a>THE  UNBREAKABLE  VOW </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and . . . was it possible? . . . a little afraid? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy’s thanks. “I did know your grandfather, after all. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Said you were the best potion-maker he’d ever known. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, “it’s Christmas, don’t be too hard —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,” said Snape curtly. “Follow me, Draco.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 321  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn’s office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons . . . or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who  suspects  me?”  said  Malfoy  angrily.  “For  the  last  time,  I didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had an enemy no one knows about — don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid, but it won’t work — I can stop you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not trying to conceal anything from  <i class="calibre3">him, </i> I just don’t want <i class="calibre3">you</i> butting in!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 322  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a>THE  UNBREAKABLE  VOW </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this — </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” jeered Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was another pause. Then Snape said, “You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. “I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks like you’ll have to break it, then, because I don’t need your protection! It’s my job, he gave it to me and I’m doing it, I’ve got a plan and it’s going to work, it’s just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is your plan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s none of your business!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not alone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn’t put them in detention!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 323  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice had risen excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark Arts — it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my side, better people!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then why not confide in me, and I can —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my glory!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, “You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your father’s capture and imprisonment has upset you, but —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard Malfoy’s footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfath-omable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“If you ask that once more,” said Harry, “I’m going to stick this sprout —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m only checking!” said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Yes, Snape was offering to help him</i>!” said Harry. “He said he’d promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An Unbreakable Vow?” said Ron, looking stunned. “Nah, he can’t have. . . . Are you sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry. “Why, what does it mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d  worked  that  much  out  for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“You die,” said Ron simply. “Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,” said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. “Only time I’ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins entered the kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bless them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said Ron grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do it by magic!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But meanwhile,” said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, “we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a — whoops-a-daisy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You made me do that!” said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. “You wait, when I’m seventeen —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,” yawned Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,” said George, “what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a snappy retort,” said Fred. “I really don’t know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was . . . how did it happen?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did she have an accident or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Ron</i>!” she said furiously. “Don’t you ever let me see you throwing knives again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No problem,” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves Harry and Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas —” muttered Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have a bed, anyway,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?” asked Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. “No, he’s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. “One of the two. Well, let’s get going, then, George.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Can’t you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we’ll be free too!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"> 327  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. “It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added George, throwing  the  paper  airplane  at  him,  “I  wouldn’t  chuck  knives  at them. Just a little hint. We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous . . . almost like real magic. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. “Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  couldn’t,”  said  Harry.  “I  promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, “Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, “ ’Course, you know what they’ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They’ll say Snape isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They didn’t hear him,” said Harry flatly. “No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah . . . I’m just saying, though,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 328  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>A  VERY  FROSTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned to face him, frowning. “You think I’m right, though?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now:  <i class="calibre3">Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer</i> <i class="calibre3">help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing. </i> . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn’s parry before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying “I told you so,” which he had done several times to Ron already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 329  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasley’s favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh, come and stir my cauldron, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And if you do it right, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’ll boil you up some hot strong love</i> <i class="calibre3">To keep you warm tonight. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. “Do you remember, Arthur?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh yes . . . marvelous tune . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 330  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p345"></a>A  VERY  FROSTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. “Be over soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy at the Ministry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we’ve made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater — only don’t repeat that, Harry,” he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know Dumbledore’s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. . . . I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they’re making some progress, and ‘three arrests’ sounds better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases’. . . but again, this is all top secret. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what  he  wanted  to  say;  as  he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went and searched the Malfoys’ house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn’t have been there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I know, I saw in the  <i class="calibre3">Prophet</i> that you’d looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 331  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin’s head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina’s crooning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">It’s left me for a spell . . . </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, “that Snape was simply pretending — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy’s up to?” said Harry quickly. “Yeah, I thought you’d say that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how do we know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley. “It’s Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledore’s wrong about Snape —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued Harry. “He says it himself. And you” — he looked Lupin straight in the eye — “do you honestly like Snape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin. “No, Harry, I am speaking the truth,” he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expression. “We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at </p>

<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, so you had to leave!” said Harry angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out anyway. We both  know  he  wanted  my  job,  but  he  could  have  wreaked  much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin with a faint smile. “And I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tel  him. It might have been on Dumbledore’s orders that Severus questioned Draco.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">. . . and now you’ve torn it quite apart</i> <i class="calibre3">I’ll thank you to give back my heart! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, what an ’orrible —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. “Who wants eggnog?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 333  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked Lupin, as Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I’ve been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost literally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s why I haven’t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s look of incomprehension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nearly all of them are on Voldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, “I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing — and sometimes killing — to eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How come they like Voldemort?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Lupin. “And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s Greyback?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed convulsively in his lap. “Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 334  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p349"></a>A  VERY  FROSTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who bit me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry, astonished. “When — when you were a kid, you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback’s insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Half-Blood what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 335  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of them was Levicorpus —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Lupin reminiscently. “There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  it  sounds  like  it  was  invented  while  you  were  at  school,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, “James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Prince.’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How old is this book, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno, I’ve never checked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wel ,  perhaps  that  wil   give  you  some  clue  as  to  when  the Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making</i> before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father’s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s got to be joking. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted. “She can’t honestly think I’d wear . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words: My Sweet heart </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, “I — I — I’ll —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning. “Come on, would I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How could she think I’d like something like that, though?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, think back,” said Harry. “Have you ever let it slip that you’d like to go out in public with the words ‘My Sweetheart’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">round your neck?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well . . . we don’t really talk much,” said Ron. “It’s mainly . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snogging,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wel ,  yeah,”  said  Ron.  He  hesitated a moment, then said, “Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno,” said Harry. “They were at Slughorn’s party together, but I don’t think it went that well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p353"></a>A  VERY  FROSTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading To Master, From Kreacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still being searched at the Ministry,” replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?” asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very thoughtful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they beautiful?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we’re washing our own socks,” said George, waving an airy hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Parsnips, Remus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 339  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p354"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Ow ’orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little shudder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. “She is always knocking —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I invited  <i class="calibre3">dear</i> Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But she wouldn’t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said Lupin. “But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn’t she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. “Snape said so anyway. I didn’t know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, “Sometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional upheaval . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. “Hey . . . it couldn’t be — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 340  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p355"></a>A  VERY  FROSTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. “Arthur — it’s Percy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> was following along in Percy’s wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, “Merry Christmas, Mother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  <i class="calibre3">Percy</i>!” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You must forgive this intrusion,” he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. “Percy and I were in the vicinity — working, you know — and he couldn’t resist dropping in and seeing you all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else’s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 341  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, come in, sit down, Minister!” fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. “Have a little purkey, or some tooding. . . . I mean —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, my dear Molly,” said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want to intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t wanted to see you all so badly. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . We’ve only looked in for five minutes, so I’ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t he take a stroll with me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know Harry’s name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. “Fine,” he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 342  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p357"></a>A  VERY  FROSTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">through the door ahead of him. “We’ll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I’ll be off. Carry on, everyone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys’ overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Charming,” said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Charming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. “Did you know that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry truthfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,” said Scrimgeour. “Natural, of course, natural, after what you’ve been through. . . . Especially what happened at the Ministry . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, so he went on, “I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has — most understandably, as I say — prevented this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, Harry said nothing, waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The rumors that have flown around!” said Scrimgeour. “Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted . . . all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being ‘the Chosen One’. . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 343  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, and the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, he decided on the truth . . . or a bit of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you, have you . . .” said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of  the  corner  of  his  eye,  Scrimgeour  squinting  at  him,  so  he  pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. “And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant  as  he  could,  and  Scrimgeour’s tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, “Oh, of course, if it’s a question of confidences, I wouldn’t want you to divulge . . . no, no . . . and in any case, does it really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One’ or not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding. “I don’t really know what you mean, Minister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, of course, to  <i class="calibre3">you</i> it will matter enormously,” said Scrimgeour with a laugh. “But to the Wizarding community at large . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s what people believe that’s important.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People believe you  <i class="calibre3">are</i> ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” said Scrimgeour. “They think you quite the hero — which, of course, you </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 344  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a>A  VERY  FROSTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHRISTMAS </p>
<p class="calibre1">are, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,” he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, “the point is, you are a symbol of hope for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be  <i class="calibre3">destined, </i> to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named — well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, “Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said Harry slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘Stand alongside the Ministry’ . . . What does that mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,” said Scrimgeour. “If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, “you’d like to give the impression that I’m working for the Ministry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 345  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cot-toned on so quickly. “ ‘The Chosen One,’ you know . . . It’s all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, “won’t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry’s up to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, that’s partly why we’d like —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly. “You see, I don’t like some of the things the Ministry’s doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. “I would not expect you to understand,” he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. “These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t think Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said Harry. “You’re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, “I see. You prefer — like your hero, Dumbledore — to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want to be used,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the Ministry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,” said Harry, his temper rising now. “You’re doing what Barty Crouch </p>

<p class="calibre1">did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we’ve got Fudge, pretending everything’s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we’ve got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said Harry, with a bitter laugh. “Not to you anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly. “It was tactless —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it was honest,” said Harry. “One of the only honest things you’ve said to me. You don’t care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you’re winning the war against Voldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh:  <i class="calibre3">I must not tell lies. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is Dumbledore up to?” said Scrimgeour brusquely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No idea,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said Scrimgeour, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“would you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 347  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I wouldn’t,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out by other means.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can try,” said Harry indifferently. “But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he’s not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a long pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses. “Dumbledore’s man through and through, aren’t you, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A SLUGGISH MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">ate in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, L and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. “It’s okay. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or about Percy. He’s such a prat, it’s not really a loss, is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 349  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p364"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Promise me you’ll look after yourself. . . . Stay out of trouble. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet life, you know me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, then, all of you. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted “Hogwarts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley’s tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagall’s office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Professor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall’s office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” she said. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p365"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean, ‘no’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is a new password,” she said. “And please don’t shout.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! Ginny!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she said breathlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you have a good Christmas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. “Oh, hang on — password.  <i class="calibre3">Abstinence. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s up with her?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore’s writing on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,” said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got loads to tell him — and you. Let’s sit down —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at that moment there was a loud squeal of “Won-Won!” and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron’s arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 351  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p366"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinkling laugh and said, “There’s a table over here. . . . Coming, Ginny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So how was your Christmas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Nothing special. How was it at Won-Won’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry. “Look, Hermione, can’t you — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I can’t,” she said flatly. “So don’t even ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yes,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said grudgingly. “But this definitely proves Malfoy’s planning something, you can’t deny that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I can’t,” she answered slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I said!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 352  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p367"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention Voldemort’s name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry frowned, trying to remember. “I’m not sure . . . Snape definitely said ‘your master,’ and who else would that be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “Maybe his father?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. “How’s Lupin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not great,” said Harry, and he told her all about Lupin’s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. “Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sounding startled. “And so have you, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!” said Hermione. “Back in Knockturn Alley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry gaped at her. “I forgot! But this  <i class="calibre3">proves</i> Malfoy’s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is pretty suspicious,” breathed Hermione. “Unless . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, come on,” said Harry in exasperation, “you can’t get round this one!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re unbelievable, you are,” said Harry, shaking his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’l  see who’s right. . . . You’ll be eating your words, Hermione, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p368"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">APPARITION LESSONS </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">If you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on</b> <b class="calibre4">or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a</b> <b class="calibre4">twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor. Please sign below if</b> <b class="calibre4">you would like to participate. Cost: 12 Galleons. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 354  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. “Should be a laugh, eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno,” said Harry. “Maybe it’s better when you do it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I forgot you’d already done it. . . . I’d better pass my test first time,” said Ron, looking anxious. “Fred and George did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George didn’t go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When can we take the actual test?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I  <i class="calibre3">could</i> Apparate if I wanted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How cool will it be when we can just —” Seamus clicked his fingers to indicate disappearance. “Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I can do it back . . . He’ll never have another peaceful moment. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 355  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p370"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: “<i class="calibre3">I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick. </i>” “Dum — er — someone took him. Side-Along-Apparition, you know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lamps in Dumbledore’s office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledore’s hands lay on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s not very happy with me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 356  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p371"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” sighed Dumbledore. “He is not very happy with me either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry’s doing a wonderful job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your support —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry angrily. “After <i class="calibre3">Umbridge</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left office. Within hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out. “It was in the <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The   <i class="calibre3">Prophet</i> is bound to report the truth occasionally,” said Dumbledore, “if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore’s man through and through.’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How very rude of him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told him I was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry’s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 357  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p372"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">that Dumbledore’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am very touched, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. “He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there’s anything else — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is, actually, sir,” said Harry. “It’s about Malfoy and Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Professor</i> Snape, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">well, I followed them, actually. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore listened to Harry’s story with an impassive face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously. “Professor, did you understand — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 358  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p373"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">understood everything you told me,” said Dumbledore, a little sharply. “I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not to be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, sir,” said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“you definitely still trust — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My answer has not changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir,” said Harry stiffly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 359  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p374"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said Dumbledore briskly. “I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, I think, the most important I have collected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the re-ception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. “How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 360  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p375"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him at the orphanage?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledore’s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you didn’t  <i class="calibre3">really</i> trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said, ‘Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trust-worthy,” said Dumbledore. “I had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my col eagues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 361  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p376"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the fore-runners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfac-torily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. “Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 362  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p377"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">mother’s family — the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shame-ful human weakness of death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name. Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts’ house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 363  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome — the teenage Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“YOU!” he bellowed. “YOU!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Stop. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The man broke it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">You speak it</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Yes, I speak it, </i>” said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of fear. His face merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Where is Marvolo</i>?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Dead, </i>” said the other. “<i class="calibre3">Died years ago, didn’t he</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riddle frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Who are you, then</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I’m Morfin, ain’t I</i>?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Marvolo’s son</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’ <i class="calibre3">Course I am, then</i> . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on his right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I thought you was that Muggle, </i>” whispered Morfin. “<i class="calibre3">You look</i> <i class="calibre3">mighty like that Muggle. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What Muggle</i>?” said Riddle sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives</i> <i class="calibre3">in the big house over the way, </i>” said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. “<i class="calibre3">You look right like him. Riddle. But</i> <i class="calibre3">he’s older now, in ’e? He’s older’n you, now I think on it. </i> . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching the edge of the table for support. “<i class="calibre3">He come back, see, </i>” he added stupidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, “<i class="calibre3">Riddle came back</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth</i>!” said Morfin, spitting on the floor again. “<i class="calibre3">Robbed us, mind, before she ran off! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Where’s the locket, eh, where’s Slytherin’s locket</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, “<i class="calibre3">Dishonored us,</i> <i class="calibre3">she did, that little slut! And who’re you, coming here and asking questions about all that? It’s over, innit. . . . It’s over. </i> . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin’s candle, extinguishing everything. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around Harry’s arm and  </p>

<p class="calibre1"> 365  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p380"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light in Dumbledore’s office seemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that impenetrable darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that all?” said Harry at once. “Why did it go dark, what happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,” said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvolo’s ring had gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the  <i class="calibre3">Avada</i> <i class="calibre3">Kedavra</i> curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The exception sits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harry’s scar. “The Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard’s murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand, which  was  proved  at  once  to  have  been  used  to  kil   the  Riddles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 366  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p381"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">All that disturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had disappeared. ‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his captors over and over again. ‘He’ll kill me for losing his ring.’ And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Harry, sitting up straight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to ‘the big house over the way’ There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind, laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he had this real memory in him all the time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,” said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime? </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 367  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p382"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked angrily. “He was underage at the time, wasn’t he? I thought they could detect underage magic!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry’s face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring’s obedience while within their walls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what happened here, look what happened to Morfin!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he had finally </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 368  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p383"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">emptied the phial. “We shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn’s office. Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, al  on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s gold-and-black ring; he had already killed his father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 369  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p384"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, “<i class="calibre3">You’ll go wrong, boy, mark my words. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn. “You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. “You don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 370  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p385"></a>A  SLUGGISH  MEMORY </p>
<p class="calibre1">so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice boomed out again, just as it had done before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t tell you if I</i> <i class="calibre3">did! Now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you mentioning</i> <i class="calibre3">them again</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s that,” said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time to go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Harry’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the rug in front of Dumbledore’s desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As you might have noticed,” said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, “that memory has been tampered with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tampered with?” repeated Harry, sitting back down too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why would he do that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,” said Dumbledore. “He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 371  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p386"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It wil  be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, “you don’t need me — you could use Legilimency . . . or Veritaserum. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck . . . and good night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly. “Good night, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry. </p>

<p class="calibre1">he next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione T the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron’s presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He loves you,” he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. “Won’t refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione, however, took a gloomier view. “He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn’t get it out of him,” she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. “Horcruxes . . .  <i class="calibre3">Horcruxes</i> . . . I’ve never even heard of them. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You haven’t?” Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 373  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p388"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They  must  be  real y  advanced  Dark  Magic,  or  why  would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it’s going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you’ll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, well, if  <i class="calibre3">Won-Won</i> thinks that, you’d better do it,” she said, flaring up at once. “After all, when has  <i class="calibre3">Won-Won’s</i> judgment ever been faulty?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, can’t you — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">No</i>!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’ve  <i class="calibre3">you</i> done?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione’s haughty profile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott’s Third Law . . . who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger can, of course!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione recited at top speed: “Golpalott’s-Third-Law-states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 374  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p389"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely!” beamed Slughorn. “Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott’s Third Law as true . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was going to have to take Slughorn’s word for it that Golpalott’s Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion’s ingredients by Scarpin’s Revel-aspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open, doo-dling absently on his new copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making. </i> Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . and so,” finished Slughorn, “I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don’t forget your protective gloves!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward Slughorn’s desk before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron, and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a shame that the Prince won’t be able to help you much with this, Harry,” she said brightly as she straightened up. “You have to understand the principles involved this time. No shortcuts or cheats!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 375  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p390"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slughorn’s desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron, and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced around at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” Ron muttered to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled out his trusty copy of  <i class="calibre3">Advanced Potion-Making</i> and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott’s Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince’s hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, “<i class="calibre3">Specialis Revelio</i>!” over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione’s expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously sepa-</p>
<p class="calibre1"> 376  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">rated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince’s book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes: Just shove a bezoar down their throats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn’t he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn’t Snape mentioned them in their first-ever Potions lesson? “<i class="calibre3">A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which</i> <i class="calibre3">will protect from most poisons. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He opened the box just as Slughorn called, “Two minutes left, everyone!” Inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to his cauldron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time’s . . . UP!” called Slughorn genially. “Well, let’s see how you’ve done! Blaise . . . what have you got for me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 377  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie’s potion and passed on to Ron’s with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron’s cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you, Harry,” he said. “What have you got to show me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got nerve, boy!” he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. “Oh, you’re like your mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . Well, I can’t fault you. . . . A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she asked through gritted teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!” said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. “Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it. . . . Yes, Harry, yes, if you’ve got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . although as they don’t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it’s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 378  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like cat-sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time to pack up!” said Slughorn. “And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, now, Harry, you’ll be late for your next lesson,” said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon-skin briefcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, “I wanted to ask you something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, “What did you say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered Slughorn. His voice had changed completely. It was not genial anymore, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. “Dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory. Well? Hasn’t he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 379  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p394"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. “Of course . . . well, if you’ve seen that memory, Harry, you’ll know that I don’t know anything —  <i class="calibre3">anything</i>” — he repeated the word forcefully — “about Horcruxes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket, and marched to the dungeon door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,” said Harry desperately, “I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you?” said Slughorn. “Then you were wrong, weren’t you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">WRONG!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was resentful that Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it!” said Harry irritably. “Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn’t I? Oh, wil  you  <i class="calibre3">get a grip</i>!” he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infuriated by his failure and by Ron’s and Hermione’s attitudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 380  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she told him. “Not a single one! I’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most  <i class="calibre3">horrible</i> books, where they tell you how to brew the most  <i class="calibre3">gruesome</i> potions — nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to  <i class="calibre3">Magick Moste Evile</i> — listen — </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction. . . .’ I mean, why mention it then?” she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. “Oh, shut up,” she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth years’ first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 381  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p396"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout — the Heads of Houses </p>
<p class="calibre1">— and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good morning,” said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shal  be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy’s rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his House. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—  by  which  time,  many  of  you may be ready to take your tests,” Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The headmaster has lifted this en-</p>
<p class="calibre1"> 382  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p397"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">chantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practice. May I emphasize that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of Houses moved among the students, marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, where are you going?” demanded Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. “It’s taking longer than I thought it would.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say. “Look, it’s none of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,” Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 383  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p398"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy  spun  around  on  the  spot,  his  hand  flying  to  his  wand, but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quiet!” and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said Twycross. “Now then . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D’s!” said Twycross. “Destination, Determination, Deliberation! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired  <i class="calibre3">destination, </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Twycross. “In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn’t stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Step two,” said Twycross, “focus your  <i class="calibre3">determination</i> to occupy the visualized space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Step three,” called Twycross, “and only when I give the com- </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 384  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p399"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">mand . . . Turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness, moving with  <i class="calibre3">deliberation</i>! On my command, now . . . one —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— two —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three D’s stood for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— THREE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never mind, never mind,” said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. “Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second attempt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,” said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, “occurs when the mind is insufficiently  <i class="calibre3">determined. </i> You must concentrate continuously upon your  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> 385  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p400"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">destination, </i> and move, without haste, but with  <i class="calibre3">deliberation</i> . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">thus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember the three D’s,” he said, “and try again . . . one — </p>
<p class="calibre1">two — three —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, “Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget:  <i class="calibre3">Destination. Determination. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Deliberation. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you do?” asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry. “I think I felt something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my feet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,” said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t feel anything,” said Harry, ignoring this interruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I don’t care about that now —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean, you don’t care? Don’t you want to learn to Apparate?” said Ron incredulously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall. “Look, hurry up, will you, there’s something I want to do. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 386  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p401"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?” asked Ron, panting slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up here,” said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys’ staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. I want to know — aha.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I solemnly swear that I am up to no good</i> . . . or Malfoy is anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At once, the Marauder’s Map appeared on the parchment’s surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle’s floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the castle’s occupants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned over it, searching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">There</i>!” said Ron, after a minute or so. “He’s in the Slytherin common room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 387  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p402"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now on,” he said firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he’s —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high level of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older — Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">February moved toward March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 388  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p403"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">a sign went up on al  common room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled. Ron was furious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was on my birthday!” he said. “I was looking forward to that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not a big surprise, though, is it?” said Harry. “Not after what happened to Katie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had still not returned from St. Mungo’s. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet, </i> including several relatives of students at Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron grumpily. “Big birthday treat . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling toward Wilkie Twycross and his three D’s, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Happy birthday, Ron,” said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. “Have a present.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He threw the package across onto Ron’s bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cheers,” said Ron drowsily and, as he ripped off the paper, Harry got out of bed, opened his own trunk, and began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 389  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p404"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly and murmuring, “<i class="calibre3">I solemnly swear that I am up to no</i> <i class="calibre3">good, </i>” so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves Harry had given him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. “Hey . . . I don’t think he’s in his bed. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously good haul this year!” he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. “See what Mum and Dad got me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blimey, I think I’ll come of age next year too. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool,” muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study. . . . He wasn’t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No thanks,” said Harry, looking up. “Malfoy’s gone again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t have done,” said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. “Come on, if you don’t hurry up, you’ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach. . . . Might make it easier, I suppose . . .” Ron looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 390  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p405"></a>BIRTHDAY  SURPRISES </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, “Mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy’s periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, but even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea: Harry had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?” he said to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron? Breakfast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not hungry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought you just said — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, “but I don’t want to eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry scrutinized him suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not that,” Ron sighed again. “You . . . you wouldn’t understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” said Ron suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I can’t stand it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> 391  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p406"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starting to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t stop thinking about her!” said Ron hoarsely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender “Lav-Lav,” he would have to put his foot down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why does that stop you having breakfast?” Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think she knows I exist,” said Ron with a desperate gesture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She definitely knows you exist,” said Harry, bewildered. “She keeps snogging you, doesn’t she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron blinked. “Who are you talking about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are  <i class="calibre3">you</i> talking about?” said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Romilda Vane,” said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, “This is a joke, right? You’re joking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think . . . Harry, I think I love her,” said Ron in a strangled voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, “okay. . . Say that again with a straight face.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I love her,” repeated Ron breathlessly. “Have you seen her hair, it’s all black and shiny and silky . . . and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her —” </p>
