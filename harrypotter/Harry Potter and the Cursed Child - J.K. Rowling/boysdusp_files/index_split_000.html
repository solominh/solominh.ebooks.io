<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	Don’t	stop	and	don’t	be	scared	you’ll	crash	into	it,	that’s	very important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Best	to	do	it	at	a	run	if	you’re	nervous. </p>

<p class="calibre1">RON:	Because	of	me!	I’m	extremely	famous.	My	nose	experiments	are legendary! </p>

<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	Parked	all	right,	then? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>RON:	I	did.	Hermione	didn’t	believe	I	could	pass	a	Muggle	driving	test,	did you? </p>

<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	And	what	would	be	wrong	with	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	Slytherin	is	the	House	of	the	snake,	of	Dark	Magic	.	.	.	It’s	not	a	House of	brave	wizards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	Albus	Severus,	you	were	named	after	two	headmasters	of	Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	them	was	a	Slytherin	and	he	was	probably	the	bravest	man	I	ever	knew. </p>

<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	If	it	matters	to	you,  <i class="calibre3">you</i>,	the	Sorting	Hat	will	take	your	feelings	into account. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>ALBUS:	I	thought	they	were	invisible! </p>
<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	Listen	to	your	professors,  <i class="calibre3">don’t</i>	listen	to	James,	and	remember	to	enjoy yourself.	Now,	if	you	don’t	want	this	train	to	leave	without	you,	you	should	leap on	.	.	. </p>
<p class="calibre1">LILY:	I’m	going	to	chase	the	train	out. </p>

<p class="calibre1">GINNY:	They’re	going	to	be	okay,	right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HERMIONE:	Hogwarts	is	a	big	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RON:	Big.	Wonderful.	Full	of	food.	I’d	give	anything	to	be	going	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	Strange,	Al	being	worried	he’ll	be	sorted	into	Slytherin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HERMIONE:	That’s	nothing,	Rose	is	worried	whether	she’ll	break	the Quidditch	scoring	record	in	her	first	or	second	year.	And	how	early	she	can	take her	O.W.L.s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RON:	I	have	no	idea	where	she	gets	her	ambition	from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GINNY:	And	how	would	you	feel,	Harry,	if	Al	—	if	he	is? </p>
<p class="calibre1">RON:	You	know,	Gin,	we	always	thought	there	was	a	chance	you	could	be sorted	into	Slytherin. </p>

<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	Good.	Third	question:	Did	Cedric	need	to	be	killed?	Easy	question, easy	answer:	No.	The	words	Voldemort	said	were	“Kill	the	spare.”	The	spare.	He died	only	because	he	was	with	my	father	and	my	father	couldn’t	save	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	we	can.	A	mistake	has	been	made	and	we’re	going	to	right	it.	We’re	going	to use	a	Time-Turner.	We’re	going	to	bring	him	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SCORPIUS:	Albus,	for	obvious	reasons,	I’m	not	a	massive	fan	of	Time-Turners	. </p>
<p class="calibre1">.	. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	When	Amos	Diggory	asked	for	the	Time-Turner	my	father	denied	they even	existed.	He	lied	to	an	old	man	who	just	wanted	his	son	back	—	who	just</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a><img src="index-48_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">loved	his	son.	And	he	did	it	because	he	didn’t	care	—	because	he	doesn’t	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	talks	about	all	the	brave	things	Dad	did.	But	he	made	some	mistakes too.	Some	big	mistakes,	in	fact.	I	want	to	set	one	of	those	mistakes	right.	I	want us	to	save	Cedric. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SCORPIUS:	Okay,	whatever	was	holding	your	brain	together	seems	to	have snapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	I’m	going	to	do	this,	Scorpius.	I	need	to	do	this.	And	you	know	as	well as	I	do,	I’ll	entirely	mess	it	up	if	you	don’t	come	with	me.	Come	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He	grins.	And	then	disappears	ever	up.	SCORPIUS	hesitates	for	a	moment.	He</i> <i class="calibre3">makes	a	face.	And	then	hoists	himself	up	and	disappears	after	ALBUS. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	As	I	calculate	it	we	should	be	approaching	the	viaduct	soon	and	then it’ll	be	a	short	hike	to	St.	Oswald’s	Home	for	Old	Witches	and	Wizards	.	.	. </p>

Welcome	to	this	Extraordinary	General Meeting.	I’m	so	pleased	so	many	of	you	could	make	it.	The	wizarding	world	has been	living	in	peace	now	for	many	years.	It’s	twenty-two	years	since	we defeated	Voldemort	at	the	Battle	of	Hogwarts,	and	I’m	delighted	to	say	there	is	a new	generation	being	brought	up	having	known	only	the	slightest	conflict.	Until</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>now.	Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	Voldemort’s	allies	have	been	showing	movement	for	a	few	months now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve	followed	trolls	making	their	way	across	Europe,	giants	starting	to	cross the	seas,	and	the	werewolves	—	well,	I’m	distressed	to	say	we	lost	sight	of	them some	weeks	ago.	We	don’t	know	where	they’re	going	or	who’s	encouraged	them to	move	—	but	we	are	aware	they	are	moving	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	we	are	concerned	what	it	might	mean.	So	we’re	asking	—	if	anyone	has	seen anything?	Felt	anything?	If	you	could	raise	a	wand,	we	will	hear	everyone	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor	McGonagall	—	thank	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PROFESSOR	McGONAGALL:	It	did	look	like	the	potions	stores	had	been interfered	with	when	we	returned	from	summer	break,	but	not	a	huge	amount	of ingredients	were	missing,	some	Boomslang	skin	and	lacewing	flies,	nothing	on the	Restricted	Register.	We	put	it	down	to	Peeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HERMIONE:	Thank	you,	Professor.	We	shall	investigate.  <i class="calibre3">(She	looks	around	the</i> <i class="calibre3">room.)</i>	Nobody	else?	Fine,	and	—	gravest	of	all	—	and	this	hasn’t	been	the	case since	Voldemort	—	Harry’s	scar	is	hurting	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DRACO:	Voldemort	is	dead,	Voldemort	is	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HERMIONE:	Yes,	Draco,	Voldemort	is	dead,	but	these	things	all	lead	us	to	think that	there	is	a	possibility	that	Voldemort	—	or	some	trace	of	Voldemort	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	be	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">This	gets	a	reaction. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">DRACO:	You	know	what	this	is	about?	Harry	just	wants	his	face	back	in	the newspapers	again.	We’ve	had	rumors	of	Voldemort	coming	back	from	the	 <i class="calibre3">Daily</i> <i class="calibre3">Prophet</i>	once	a	year	every	year	—</p>

<p class="calibre1">But	no,	what’s	this	.	.	.	Cedric	Diggory	is	ascending	out	of	the	water	and seemingly	out	of	the	competition.	Oh,	ladies	and	gentlemen,	we	don’t	have	our winner	but	we	certainly	have	our	loser.	Cedric	Diggory	is	turning	into	a	balloon, and	this	balloon	wants	to	fly.	Fly,	ladies	and	gentlemen,	fly.	Fly	out	of	the	task and	out	of	the	tournament	and	—	oh	my,	it	gets	wilder	still,	around	Cedric, fireworks	 <i class="calibre3">explode</i>	declaiming	—	“Ron	loves	Hermione”	—</p>

<p class="calibre1">It’s	quite	some	picture,	it’s	quite	some	sight,	it’s	quite	some	tragedy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	a	humiliation,	there’s	no	other	word	for	it. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	world	becomes	darker.	The	world	becomes	almost	black,	in	fact. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">SCORPIUS	suddenly	emerges,	shooting	up	through	the	water.	And	he’s</i> <i class="calibre3">triumphant. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">SCORPIUS:	Woooo-hoooooo! </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He	looks	around,	surprised.	Where’s	ALBUS?	He	puts	his	arms	into	the	air. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And	there’s	a	whisper	in	Parseltongue.	Which	travels	fast	around	the</i>	 <i class="calibre3">audience. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">DOLORES	UMBRIDGE:	I	am	the	headmistress,	and	however	important	your family	may	be	—	it	doesn’t	give	you	an	excuse	to	dillydally,	to	mess	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SCORPIUS:	There’s	a	boy	in	this	lake.	You	need	to	get	help.	I’m	looking	for	my friend,	Miss.	Professor.	Headmaster.	One	of	Hogwarts’s	students,	Miss.	I’m looking	for	Albus	Potter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DOLORES	UMBRIDGE:	Potter?	Albus	Potter?	There’s	no	such	student.	In	fact, there	hasn’t	been	a	Potter	at	Hogwarts	for	years	—	and	that	boy	didn’t	turn	out so	well.	Not	so	much	rest	in	peace,	Harry	Potter,	more	rest	in	perpetual	despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Total	troublemaker. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	wind	continues.	This	is	hell.	And	then,	right	from	the	back	of	the	room,</i> <i class="calibre3">whispering	around	everyone. </i></p>
