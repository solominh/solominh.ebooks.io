Valued	by	the	faculty.	Valued	especially	by	me.	I’ve	positively	glowed about	you	in	dispatches	to	the	Augurey.	Our	work	together	flushing	out	the	more dilettante	students	has	made	this	school	a	safer,	purer	place	—</p>

<p class="calibre1">HARRY:	You	know,	it	wasn’t	until	we	thought	Albus	had	gone	that	I	truly understood	what	my	mother	was	able	to	do	for	me.	A	countercharm	so	powerful that	it	was	able	to	repel	the	spell	of	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GINNY:	And	the	only	spell	Voldemort	couldn’t	understand	—	love. </p>

<p class="calibre1">GINNY:	Delphi’s	picked	tonight	because	he’s	here	—	because	her	father	is coming.	She	wants	to	meet	him.	Be	with	him,	the	father	she	loves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">HERMIONE:	Of	course,	Ginny.	Delphi’s	not	trying	to	kill	Harry	—	she’s stopping	Voldemort	trying	to	kill	Harry.	Brilliant. </p>

<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	Does	she	know	when	he	does	turn	up?	Hasn’t	she	come	here	twenty-four	hours	early	because	she	isn’t	sure	when	he’ll	arrive	and	in	what	direction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	history	books	—	correct	me	if	I’m	wrong,	Scorpius	—	show	nothing	about when	and	how	he	arrived	in	Godric’s	Hollow? </p>

<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	In	an	alternate	reality	where	you	were	significantly	—	really significantly	more	popular	—	a	different	girl	asked	you	out	—	and	that	means	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">SCORPIUS:	And	yes,	logic	would	dictate	I	should	be	pursuing	Polly	—	or allowing	her	to	pursue	me	—	she’s	a	notorious	beauty,	after	all	—	but	a	Rose	is	a Rose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	You	know	logic	would	dictate	that	you’re	a	freak?	Rose	hates	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SCORPIUS:	Correction,	she	used	to	hate	me,	but	did	you	see	the	look	in	her eyes	when	I	asked?	That	wasn’t	hate,	that	was	pity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">SCORPIUS:	A	walk? </p>
<p class="calibre1">ALBUS:	I	know,	I	think	it’s	a	bonding	thing	or	something	similarly	vomit-inducing.	Still,	you	know,	I	think	I’ll	go. </p>

I’ve	got nothing	—	or	very	little.	So	I’m	learning,	okay?	And	I’m	going	to	try	with everything	I’ve	got	—	to	be	a	good	dad	for	you. </p>
