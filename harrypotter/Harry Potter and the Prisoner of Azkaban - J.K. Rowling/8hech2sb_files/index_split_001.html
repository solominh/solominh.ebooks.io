<p class="calibre1">were  sitting  in  a  very  bright  spotlight;  the  rest  of  the  class  kept  shooting</p>
<p class="calibre1">furtive  glances  at  him,  as  though  he  were  about  to  drop  dead  at  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment.  He  hardly  heard  what  Professor  McGonagall  was  telling  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  Animagi  (wizards  who  could  transform  at  will  into  animals),  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t  even  watching  when  she  transformed  herself  in  front  of  their  eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really,  what  has  got  into  you  all  today?”  said  Professor  McGonagall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">turning  back  into  herself  with  a  faint   <i class="calibre3">pop, </i>  and  staring  around  at  them  all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>“Not  that  it  matters,  but  that’s  the  first  time  my  transformation’s  not  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">applause from a class.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody’s heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione raised her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, Professor, we’ve just had our first Divination class, and we were</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading the tea leaves, and —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, of course,” said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. “There</p>
<p class="calibre1">is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be</p>
<p class="calibre1">dying this year?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone stared at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,” said Harry, finally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  see,”  said  Professor  McGonagall,  fixing  Harry  with  her  beady  eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then  you  should  know,  Potter,  that  Sibyll  Trelawney  has  predicted  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">has  died  yet.  Seeing  death  omens  is  her  favorite  way  of  greeting  a  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">white. She went on, more calmly, “Divination is one of the most imprecise</p>
<p class="calibre1">branches  of  magic.  I  shall  not  conceal  from  you  that  I  have  very  little</p>
<p class="calibre1">patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, “You look</p>
<p class="calibre1">in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don’t let you off</p>
<p class="calibre1">homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Trelawney’s  classroom.  Not  everyone  was  convinced,  however. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  still  looked  worried,  and  Lavender  whispered,  “But  what  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville’s cup?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  Transfiguration  class  had  finished,  they  joined  the  crowd</p>
<p class="calibre1">thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron,  cheer  up,”  said  Hermione,  pushing  a  dish  of  stew  toward  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You heard what Professor McGonagall said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn’t start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” he said, in a low, serious voice, “you  <i class="calibre3">haven’t</i> seen a great black</p>
<p class="calibre1">dog anywhere, have you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I have,” said Harry. “I saw one the night I left the Dursleys’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron let his fork fall with a clatter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>“Probably a stray,” said Hermione calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, if Harry’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s bad,” he said. “My —</p>
<p class="calibre1">my uncle Bilius saw one and — and he died twenty-four hours later!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coincidence,”  said  Hermione  airily,  pouring  herself  some  pumpkin</p>
<p class="calibre1">juice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  don’t  know  what  you’re  talking  about!”  said  Ron,  starting  to  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">angry. “Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There you are, then,” said Hermione in a superior tone. “They see the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grim  and  die  of  fright.  The  Grim’s  not  an  omen,  it’s  the  cause  of  death! </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  Harry’s  still  with  us  because  he’s  not  stupid  enough  to  see  one  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her</p>
<p class="calibre1">new Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think Divination seems very woolly,” she said, searching for her page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!” said Ron hotly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheep,” said Hermione coolly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Trelawney said you didn’t have the right aura! You just don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">like being bad at something for a change!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a lump of tea leaves, I’m not sure I’ll be studying it much longer! That</p>
<p class="calibre1">lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She snatched up her bag and stalked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron frowned after her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  she  talking  about?”  he  said  to  Harry.  “She  hasn’t  been  to  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arithmancy class yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  pleased  to  get  out  of  the  castle  after  lunch.  Yesterday’s  rain</p>
<p class="calibre1">had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy and</p>
<p class="calibre1">damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical Creatures</p>
<p class="calibre1">class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione weren’t speaking to each other. Harry walked beside</p>
<p class="calibre1">them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid’s hut on the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted three only-too-</p>
<p class="calibre1">familiar  backs  ahead  of  them  that  he  realized  they  must  be  having  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew what they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">talking about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking impatient</p>
<p class="calibre1">to start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon, now, get a move on!” he called as the class approached. “Got a</p>
<p class="calibre1">real  treat  for  yeh  today!  Great  lesson  comin’  up!  Everyone  here?  Right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">follow me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last</p>
<p class="calibre1">him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  five  minutes  later,  they  found  themselves  outside  a  kind  of  paddock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was nothing in there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone gather ’round the fence here!” he called. “That’s it — make</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure yeh can see — now, firs’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh?” said Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The Monster Book of Monsters, </i> which he had bound shut with a length of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rope.  Other  people  took  theirs  out  too;  some,  like  Harry,  had  belted  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">book  shut;  others  had  crammed  them  inside  tight  bags  or  clamped  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">together with binder clips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hasn’  —  hasn’  anyone  bin  able  ter  open  their  books?”  said  Hagrid, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking crestfallen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The class all shook their heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh’ve  got  ter   <i class="calibre3">stroke</i>  ’em,”  said  Hagrid,  as  though  this  was  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">obvious thing in the world. “Look —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took Hermione’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  how  silly  we’ve  all  been!”  Malfoy  sneered.  “We  should  have</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">stroked</i> them! Why didn’t we guess!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — I thought they were funny,” Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>“Oh, tremendously funny!” said Malfoy. “Really witty, giving us books</p>
<p class="calibre1">that try and rip our hands off!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wanted Hagrid’s first lesson to be a success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Righ’ then,” said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, “so — so</p>
<p class="calibre1">yeh’ve got yer books an’ — an’ — now yeh need the Magical Creatures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah. So I’ll go an’ get ’em. Hang on …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God,  this  place  is  going  to  the  dogs,”  said  Malfoy  loudly.  “That  oaf</p>
<p class="calibre1">teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when I tell him —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Careful, Potter, there’s a dementor behind you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oooooooh!”  squealed  Lavender  Brown,  pointing  toward  the  opposite</p>
<p class="calibre1">side of the paddock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trotting  toward  them  were  a  dozen  of  the  most  bizarre  creatures  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, </p>
<p class="calibre1">steel-colored  beaks  and  large,  brilliantly  orange  eyes.  The  talons  on  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick leather collar around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  ends  of  all  of  these  were  held  in  the  vast  hands  of  Hagrid,  who  came</p>
<p class="calibre1">jogging into the paddock behind the creatures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gee up, there!” he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward  the  fence  where  the  class  stood.  Everyone  drew  back  slightly  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. “Beau’iful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’ they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">shock  of  seeing  something  that  was  half  horse,  half  bird,  you  started  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">appreciate the hippogriffs’ gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  hair,  each  of  them  a  different  color:  stormy  gray,  bronze,  pinkish  roan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">gleaming chestnut, and inky black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”  said  Hagrid,  rubbing  his  hands  together  and  beaming  around,  “if</p>
<p class="calibre1">yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  one  seemed  to  want  to.  Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione,  however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">approached the fence cautiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>“Now,  firs’  thing  yeh  gotta  know  abou’  hippogriffs  is,  they’re  proud,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said  Hagrid.  “Easily  offended,  hippogriffs  are.  Don’t  never  insult  one, </p>
<p class="calibre1">’cause it might be the last thing yeh do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy,  Crabbe,  and  Goyle  weren’t  listening;  they  were  talking  in  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">undertone  and  Harry  had  a  nasty  feeling  they  were  plotting  how  best  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">disrupt the lesson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh  always  wait  fer  the  hippogriff  ter  make  the  firs’  move,”  Hagrid</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued.  “It’s  polite,  see?  Yeh  walk  toward  him,  and  yeh  bow,  an’  yeh</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait. If he bows back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn’ bow, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">get away from him sharpish, ’cause those talons hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right — who wants ter go first?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  had  misgivings.  The  hippogriffs  were  tossing  their  fierce  heads</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  flexing  their  powerful  wings;  they  didn’t  seem  to  like  being  tethered</p>
<p class="calibre1">like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll do it,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good man, Harry!” roared Hagrid. “Right then — let’s see how yeh get</p>
<p class="calibre1">on with Buckbeak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  untied  one  of  the  chains,  pulled  the  gray  hippogriff  away  from  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">paddock  seemed  to  be  holding  its  breath.  Malfoy’s  eyes  were  narrowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">maliciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easy, now, Harry,” said Hagrid quietly. “Yeh’ve got eye contact, now try</p>
<p class="calibre1">not ter blink. … Hippogriffs don’ trust yeh if yeh blink too much. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  eyes  immediately  began  to  water,  but  he  didn’t  shut  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak  had  turned  his  great,  sharp  head  and  was  staring  at  Harry  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">one fierce orange eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tha’s it,” said Hagrid. “Tha’s it, Harry … now, bow …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn’t move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Hagrid, sounding worried. “Right — back away, now, Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">easy does it —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>But then, to Harry’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its</p>
<p class="calibre1">scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well done, Harry!” said Hagrid, ecstatic. “Right — yeh can touch him! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pat his beak, go on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the beak</p>
<p class="calibre1">several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though enjoying it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who were looking deeply disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Righ’ then, Harry,” said Hagrid. “I reckon he might’ let yeh ride him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  more  than  Harry  had  bargained  for.  He  was  used  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">broomstick; but he wasn’t sure a hippogriff would be quite the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said Hagrid, “an’ mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">yeh don’ pull any of his feathers out, he won’ like that. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  put  his  foot  on  the  top  of  Buckbeak’s  wing  and  hoisted  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto  its  back.  Buckbeak  stood  up.  Harry  wasn’t  sure  where  to  hold  on; </p>
<p class="calibre1">everything in front of him was covered with feathers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s hindquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry; </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  just  had  time  to  seize  the  hippogriff  around  the  neck  before  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">soaring  upward.  It  was  nothing  like  a  broomstick,  and  Harry  knew  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">one he preferred; the hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on either side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare</p>
<p class="calibre1">get  a  stronger  grip;  instead  of  the  smooth  action  of  his  Nimbus  Two</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thousand,  he  now  felt  himself  rocking  backward  and  forward  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground;  this  was  the  bit  Harry  had  been  dreading;  he  leaned  back  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt  a  heavy  thud  as  the  four  ill-assorted  feet  hit  the  ground.  He  just</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed to hold on and push himself straight again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good work, Harry!” roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Goyle cheered. “Okay, who else wants a go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emboldened by Harry’s success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  bowing  nervously,  all  over  the  paddock.  Neville  ran  repeatedly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>backward from his, which didn’t seem to want to bend its knees. Ron and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is very easy,” Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to hear him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  knew  it  must  have  been,  if  Potter  could  do  it.  …  I  bet  you’re  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous  at  all,  are  you?”  he  said  to  the  hippogriff.  “Are  you,  you  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">ugly brute?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  happened  in  a  flash  of  steely  talons;  Malfoy  let  out  a  high-pitched</p>
<p class="calibre1">scream  and  next  moment,  Hagrid  was  wrestling  Buckbeak  back  into  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">collar  as  he  strained  to  get  at  Malfoy,  who  lay  curled  in  the  grass,  blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">blossoming over his robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  dying!”  Malfoy  yelled  as  the  class  panicked.  “I’m  dying,  look  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">me! It’s killed me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yer not dyin’!” said Hagrid, who had gone very white. “Someone help</p>
<p class="calibre1">me — gotta get him outta here —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  ran  to  hold  open  the  gate  as  Hagrid  lifted  Malfoy  easily.  As</p>
<p class="calibre1">they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy’s arm; </p>
<p class="calibre1">blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They should fire him straight away!” said Pansy Parkinson, who was in</p>
<p class="calibre1">tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was Malfoy’s fault!” snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed</p>
<p class="calibre1">their muscles threateningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to see if he’s okay!” said Pansy, and they all watched her run</p>
<p class="calibre1">up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">away  in  the  direction  of  their  dungeon  common  room;  Harry,  Ron,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you think he’ll be all right?” said Hermione nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“  ’Course  he  will.  Madam  Pomfrey  can  mend  cuts  in  about  a  second,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  was  a  really  bad  thing  to  happen  in  Hagrid’s  first  class,  though, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t it?” said Ron, looking worried. “Trust Malfoy to mess things up for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping</p>
<p class="calibre1">to see Hagrid, but he wasn’t there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They   <i class="calibre3">wouldn’t</i>  fire  him,  would  they?”  said  Hermione  anxiously,  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">touching her steak-and-kidney pudding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’d better not,” said Ron, who wasn’t eating either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  you  can’t  say  it  wasn’t  an  interesting  first  day  back,”  said  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">gloomily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried  to  do  the  homework  Professor  McGonagall  had  given  them,  but  all</p>
<p class="calibre1">three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a light on in Hagrid’s window,” Harry said suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked at his watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It’s still quite early. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  allowed  to  walk  across  the   <i class="calibre3">grounds, </i>”  he  said  pointedly.  “Sirius</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black hasn’t got past the dementors yet, has he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad to</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren’t entirely sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">they were supposed to be out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  grass  was  still  wet  and  looked  almost  black  in  the  twilight.  When</p>
<p class="calibre1">they reached Hagrid’s hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, “C’min.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid  was  sitting  in  his  shirtsleeves  at  his  scrubbed  wooden  table;  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">boarhound,  Fang,  had  his  head  in  Hagrid’s  lap.  One  look  told  them  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them</p>
<p class="calibre1">into focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Spect it’s a record,” he said thickly, when he recognized them. “Don’</p>
<p class="calibre1">reckon they’ve ever had a teacher who lasted on’y a day before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You haven’t been fired, Hagrid!” gasped Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not yet,” said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the tankard. “But ’s only a matter o’ time, i’n’t it, after Malfoy …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How is he?” said Ron as they all sat down. “It wasn’t serious, was it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said Hagrid dully, “but he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">sayin’ it’s still agony … covered in bandages … moanin’ …” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>“He’s  faking  it,”  said  Harry  at  once.  “Madam  Pomfrey  can  mend</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything. She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s worth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“School gov’nors have bin told, o’ course,” said Hagrid miserably. “They</p>
<p class="calibre1">reckon  I  started  too  big.  Shoulda  left  hippogriffs  fer  later  …  done</p>
<p class="calibre1">flobberworms or summat. … Jus’ thought it’d make a good firs’ lesson. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">’S all my fault. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all  <i class="calibre3">Malfoy’s</i> fault, Hagrid!” said Hermione earnestly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re witnesses,” said Harry. “You said hippogriffs attack if you insult</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. It’s Malfoy’s problem that he wasn’t listening. We’ll tell Dumbledore</p>
<p class="calibre1">what really happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, don’t worry, Hagrid, we’ll back you up,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,” said Hermione firmly. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ar, maybe she’s right,” said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">both  staggered  away,  rubbing  their  ribs.  Hagrid  heaved  himself  out  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud splash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s he done?” said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the empty tankard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stuck his head in the water barrel,” said Hermione, putting the tankard</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tha’s better,” he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them</p>
<p class="calibre1">all. “Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an’ see me, I really —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he’d only just realized he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WHAT D’YEH THINK YOU’RE DOIN’, EH?” he roared, so suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  jumped  a  foot  in  the  air.  “YEH’RE  NOT  TO  GO  WANDERIN’</p>
<p class="calibre1">AROUND AFTER DARK, HARRY! AN’ YOU TWO! LETTIN’ HIM!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon!” Hagrid said angrily. “I’m takin’ yer all back up ter school, an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’  let  me  catch  yeh  walkin’  down  ter  see  me  after  dark  again.  I’m  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">worth that!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Boggart in the Wardrobe</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy didn’t reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Slytherins  and  Gryffindors  were  halfway  through  double  Potions.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound</p>
<p class="calibre1">up  in  a  sling,  acting,  in  Harry’s  opinion,  as  though  he  were  the  heroic</p>
<p class="calibre1">survivor of some dreadful battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How is it, Draco?” simpered Pansy Parkinson. “Does it hurt much?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Settle down, settle down,” said Professor Snape idly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn’t have said “settle</p>
<p class="calibre1">down” if  <i class="calibre3">they’d</i> walked in late, he’d have given them detention. But Malfoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">had always been able to get away with anything in Snape’s classes; Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">was head of Slytherin House, and generally favored his own students above</p>
<p class="calibre1">all others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set</p>
<p class="calibre1">up  his  cauldron  right  next  to  Harry  and  Ron,  so  that  they  were  preparing</p>
<p class="calibre1">their ingredients on the same table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,”  Malfoy  called,  “sir,  I’ll  need  help  cutting  up  these  daisy  roots, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because of my arm —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him,” said Snape without looking up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>Ron went brick red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s nothing wrong with your arm,” he hissed at Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy smirked across the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  seized  his  knife,  pulled  Malfoy’s  roots  toward  him,  and  began  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor,” drawled Malfoy, “Weasley’s mutilating my roots, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, sir — !” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  had  spent  the  last  quarter  of  an  hour  carefully  shredding  his  own</p>
<p class="calibre1">roots into exactly equal pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Now, </i>” said Snape in his most dangerous voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at Malfoy, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">took up the knife again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And, sir, I’ll need this shrivelfig skinned,” said Malfoy, his voice full of</p>
<p class="calibre1">malicious laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter, you can skin Malfoy’s shrivelfig,” said Snape, giving Harry the</p>
<p class="calibre1">look of loathing he always reserved just for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took Malfoy’s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  roots  he  now  had  to  use.  Harry  skinned  the  shrivelfig  as  fast  as  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking. Malfoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">was smirking more broadly than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seen your pal Hagrid lately?” he asked them quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None of your business,” said Ron jerkily, without looking up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid he won’t be a teacher much longer,” said Malfoy in a tone of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mock sorrow. “Father’s not very happy about my injury —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep talking, Malfoy, and I’ll give you a real injury,” snarled Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—  he’s  complained  to  the  school  governors.  <i class="calibre3">And</i>  to  the  Ministry  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic. Father’s got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury like</p>
<p class="calibre1">this” — he gave a huge, fake sigh — “who knows if my arm’ll ever be the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s why you’re putting it on,” said Harry, accidentally beheading a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead  caterpillar  because  his  hand  was  shaking  in  anger.  “To  try  to  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid fired.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>“Well,” said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, “<i class="calibre3">partly, </i> Potter. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pieces  in  Potions  lessons;  it  was  his  worst  subject,  and  his  great  fear  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Snape  made  things  ten  times  worse.  His  potion,  which  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Orange,  Longbottom,”  said  Snape,  ladling  some  up  and  allowing  it  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see. “Orange. Tell me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn’t you hear me</p>
<p class="calibre1">say, quite clearly, that only one rat spleen was needed? Didn’t I state plainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand, Longbottom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, sir,” said Hermione, “please, I could help Neville put it right —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  remember  asking  you  to  show  off,  Miss  Granger,”  said  Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. “Longbottom, at the end of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help me!” he moaned to Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,  Harry,”  said  Seamus  Finnigan,  leaning  over  to  borrow  Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">brass scales, “have you heard?  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> this morning — they reckon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius Black’s been sighted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?”  said  Harry  and  Ron  quickly.  On  the  other  side  of  the  table, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy looked up, listening closely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not  too  far  from  here,”  said  Seamus,  who  looked  excited.  “It  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muggle who saw him. ’Course, she didn’t really understand. The Muggles</p>
<p class="calibre1">think  he’s  just  an  ordinary  criminal,  don’t  they?  So  she  phoned  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">telephone  hot  line.  By  the  time  the  Ministry  of  Magic  got  there,  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not too far from here … ,” Ron repeated, looking significantly at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. “What, Malfoy? Need</p>
<p class="calibre1">something else skinned?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Malfoy’s  eyes  were  shining  malevolently,  and  they  were  fixed  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry. He leaned across the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry offhandedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy’s thin mouth was curving in a mean smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of  course,  if  it  was  me,”  he  said  quietly,  “I’d  have  done  something</p>
<p class="calibre1">before now. I wouldn’t be staying in school like a good boy, I’d be out there</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking for him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you talking about, Malfoy?” said Ron roughly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you  <i class="calibre3">know, </i> Potter?” breathed Malfoy, his pale eyes narrowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Know what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck,” he said. “Want to leave it to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors, do you? But if it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What  are  you  talking  about</i>?”  said  Harry  angrily,  but  at  that  moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape called, “You should have finished adding your ingredients by now; </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  potion  needs  to  stew  before  it  can  be  drunk,  so  clear  away  while  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">simmers and then we’ll test Longbottom’s. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred</p>
<p class="calibre1">his potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner  of  her  mouth,  so  that  Snape  wouldn’t  see.  Harry  and  Ron  packed</p>
<p class="calibre1">away  their  unused  ingredients  and  went  to  wash  their  hands  and  ladles  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the stone basin in the corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did Malfoy mean?” Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle’s mouth. “Why would I want</p>
<p class="calibre1">revenge on Black? He hasn’t done anything to me — yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  making  it  up,”  said  Ron  savagely.  “He’s  trying  to  make  you  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">something stupid. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  end  of  the  lesson  in  sight,  Snape  strode  over  to  Neville,  who  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">cowering by his cauldron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone  gather  ’round,”  said  Snape,  his  black  eyes  glittering,  “and</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch what happens to Longbottom’s toad. If he has managed to produce a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don’t doubt, he has</p>
<p class="calibre1">done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked  up  Trevor  the  toad  in  his  left  hand  and  dipped  a  small  spoon  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville’s  potion,  which  was  now  green.  He  trickled  a  few  drops  down</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trevor’s throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>There  was  a  moment  of  hushed  silence,  in  which  Trevor  gulped;  then</p>
<p class="calibre1">there  was  a  small  pop,  and  Trevor  the  tadpole  was  wriggling  in  Snape’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he reappeared suddenly, fully grown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Five points from Gryffindor,” said Snape, which wiped the smiles from</p>
<p class="calibre1">every face. “I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  still  thinking  about  what  Malfoy  had  said,  while  Ron  was  seething</p>
<p class="calibre1">about Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Five  points  from  Gryffindor  because  the  potion  was  all  right!  Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t you lie, Hermione? You should’ve said Neville did it all by himself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione didn’t answer. Ron looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She was right behind us,” said Ron, frowning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There she is,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched</p>
<p class="calibre1">her  bag,  the  other  seemed  to  be  tucking  something  down  the  front  of  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you do that?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Hermione, joining them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the bottom of the stairs again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” Hermione looked slightly confused. “Oh — I had to go back for</p>
<p class="calibre1">something. Oh no —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  seam  had  split  on  Hermione’s  bag.  Harry  wasn’t  surprised;  he  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are you carrying all these around with you?” Ron asked her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know how many subjects I’m taking,” said Hermione breathlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Couldn’t hold these for me, could you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But —” Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the covers. “You haven’t got any of these subjects today. It’s only Defense</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into</p>
<p class="calibre1">her  bag  just  the  same.  “I  hope  there’s  something  good  for  lunch,  I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">starving,” she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you get the feeling Hermione’s not telling us something?” Ron asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Lupin  wasn’t  there  when  they  arrived  at  his  first  Defense</p>
<p class="calibre1">Against  the  Dark  Arts  lesson.  They  all  sat  down,  took  out  their  books, </p>
<p class="calibre1">quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  smiled  vaguely  and  placed  his  tatty  old  briefcase  on  the  teacher’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk.  He  was  as  shabby  as  ever  but  looked  healthier  than  he  had  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">train, as though he had had a few square meals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good afternoon,” he said. “Would you please put all your books back in</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  bags.  Today’s  will  be  a  practical  lesson.  You  will  need  only  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">wands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  had  never  had  a  practical  Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts  before, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unless  you  counted  the  memorable  class  last  year  when  their  old  teacher</p>
<p class="calibre1">had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right then,” said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. “If you’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Puzzled  but  interested,  the  class  got  to  its  feet  and  followed  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  out  of  the  classroom.  He  led  them  along  the  deserted  corridor  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the Poltergeist, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  was  floating  upside  down  in  midair  and  stuffing  the  nearest  keyhole</p>
<p class="calibre1">with chewing gum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peeves didn’t look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; then he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Loony, loopy Lupin,” Peeves sang. “Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rude  and  unmanageable  as  he  almost  always  was,  Peeves  usually</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed  some  respect  toward  the  teachers.  Everyone  looked  quickly  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was still</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d  take  that  gum  out  of  the  keyhole  if  I  were  you,  Peeves,”  he  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasantly. “Mr. Filch won’t be able to get in to his brooms.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>Filch  was  the  Hogwarts  caretaker,  a  bad-tempered,  failed  wizard  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">waged  a  constant  war  against  the  students  and,  indeed,  Peeves.  However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin’s words, except to blow a loud</p>
<p class="calibre1">wet raspberry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his shoulder. “Please</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch closely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He raised the wand to shoulder height, said, “<i class="calibre3">Waddiwasi</i>!” and pointed it</p>
<p class="calibre1">at Peeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  force  of  a  bullet,  the  wad  of  chewing  gum  shot  out  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">keyhole  and  straight  down  Peeves’s  left  nostril;  he  whirled  upright  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">zoomed away, cursing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool, sir!” said Dean Thomas in amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Dean,” said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall we proceed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  set  off  again,  the  class  looking  at  shabby  Professor  Lupin  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside the staffroom door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">empty  except  for  one  teacher.  Professor  Snape  was  sitting  in  a  low</p>
<p class="calibre1">armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were glittering</p>
<p class="calibre1">and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As Professor Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">came in and made to close the door behind him, Snape said, “Leave it open, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin. I’d rather not witness this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  got  to  his  feet  and  strode  past  the  class,  his  black  robes  billowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind  him.  At  the  doorway  he  turned  on  his  heel  and  said,  “Possibly  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">one’s  warned  you,  Lupin,  but  this  class  contains  Neville  Longbottom.  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  advise  you  not  to  entrust  him  with  anything  difficult.  Not  unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville  went  scarlet.  Harry  glared  at  Snape;  it  was  bad  enough  that  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">bullied  Neville  in  his  own  classes,  let  alone  doing  it  in  front  of  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">teachers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  was  hoping  that  Neville  would  assist  me  with  the  first  stage  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">operation,” he said, “and I am sure he will perform it admirably.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>Neville’s  face  went,  if  possible,  even  redder.  Snape’s  lip  curled,  but  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">left, shutting the door with a snap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, then,” said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept  their  spare  robes.  As  Professor  Lupin  went  to  stand  next  to  it,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing  to  worry  about,”  said  Professor  Lupin  calmly  because  a  few</p>
<p class="calibre1">people had jumped backward in alarm. “There’s a boggart in there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  people  seemed  to  feel  that  this   <i class="calibre3">was</i>  something  to  worry  about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville  gave  Professor  Lupin  a  look  of  pure  terror,  and  Seamus  Finnigan</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I’ve even met one that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  lodged  itself  in  a  grandfather  clock.  <i class="calibre3">This</i>  one  moved  in  yesterday</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my</p>
<p class="calibre1">third years some practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what  <i class="calibre3">is</i> a boggart?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione put up her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">will frighten us most.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">glowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a</p>
<p class="calibre1">form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most</p>
<p class="calibre1">fears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This  means,”  said  Professor  Lupin,  choosing  to  ignore  Neville’s  small</p>
<p class="calibre1">sputter of terror, “that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and</p>
<p class="calibre1">down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but Harry had a go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er  —  because  there  are  so  many  of  us,  it  won’t  know  what  shape  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely,”  said  Professor  Lupin,  and  Hermione  put  her  hand  down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking  a  little  disappointed.  “It’s  always  best  to  have  company  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re  dealing  with  a  boggart.  He  becomes  confused.  Which  should  he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>become,  a  headless  corpse  or  a  flesh-eating  slug?  I  once  saw  a  boggart</p>
<p class="calibre1">make that very mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is  <i class="calibre3">laughter. </i> What you need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  will  practice  the  charm  without  wands  first.  After  me,  please  …</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">riddikulus</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>!” said the class together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”  said  Professor  Lupin.  “Very  good.  But  that  was  the  easy  part, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you</p>
<p class="calibre1">come in, Neville.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward as though he were heading for the gallows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,  Neville,”  said  Professor  Lupin.  “First  things  first:  what  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville’s lips moved, but no noise came out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t catch that, Neville, sorry,” said Professor Lupin cheerfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin, however, looked thoughtful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor  Snape  …  hmmm  …  Neville,  I  believe  you  live  with  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandmother?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — yes,” said Neville nervously. “But — I don’t want the boggart to</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn into her either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, you misunderstand me,” said Professor Lupin, now smiling. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonder,  could  you  tell  us  what  sort  of  clothes  your  grandmother  usually</p>
<p class="calibre1">wears?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville looked startled, but said, “Well … always the same hat. A tall one</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress … green, normally … and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes a fox-fur scarf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And a handbag?” prompted Professor Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A big red one,” said Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right then,” said Professor Lupin. “Can you picture those clothes very</p>
<p class="calibre1">clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind’s eye?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>“Yes,”  said  Neville  uncertainly,  plainly  wondering  what  was  coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees you, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">will assume the form of Professor Snape,” said Lupin. “And you will raise</p>
<p class="calibre1">your wand — thus — and cry ‘ <i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>’ — and concentrate hard on your</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandmother’s  clothes.  If  all  goes  well,  Professor  Boggart  Snape  will  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red</p>
<p class="calibre1">handbag.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  great  shout  of  laughter.  The  wardrobe  wobbled  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  us  in  turn,”  said  Professor  Lupin.  “I  would  like  all  of  you  to  take  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and imagine how</p>
<p class="calibre1">you might force it to look comical. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  room  went  quiet.  Harry  thought  …  What  scared  him  most  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world? </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  first  thought  was  Lord  Voldemort  —  a  Voldemort  returned  to  full</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  boggart-Voldemort,  a  horrible  image  came  floating  to  the  surface  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  rotting,  glistening  hand,  slithering  back  beneath  a  black  cloak  …  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth … then a cold so penetrating it</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt like drowning. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  shivered,  then  looked  around,  hoping  no  one  had  noticed.  Many</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  had  their  eyes  shut  tight.  Ron  was  muttering  to  himself,  “Take  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">legs off.” Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron’s greatest fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">was spiders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone ready?” said Professor Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  felt  a  lurch  of  fear.  He  wasn’t  ready.  How  could  you  make  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor  less  frightening?  But  he  didn’t  want  to  ask  for  more  time; </p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville,  we’re  going  to  back  away,”  said  Professor  Lupin.  “Let  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a clear field, all right? I’ll call the next person forward. … Everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone beside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  wardrobe.  He  looked  pale  and  frightened,  but  he  had  pushed  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>“On the count of three, Neville,” said Professor Lupin, who was pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  own  wand  at  the  handle  of  the  wardrobe.  “One  —  two  —  three  —</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">now</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin’s wand and hit the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville  backed  away,  his  wand  up,  mouthing  wordlessly.  Snape  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">R</i> —  <i class="calibre3">r</i> —  <i class="calibre3">riddikulus</i>!” squeaked Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long,  lace-trimmed  dress  and  a  towering  hat  topped  with  a  moth-eaten</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin shouted, “Parvati! Forward!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati  walked  forward,  her  face  set.  Snape  rounded  on  her.  There  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">another  crack,  and  where  he  had  stood  was  a  bloodstained,  bandaged</p>
<p class="calibre1">mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>!” cried Parvati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A bandage unraveled at the mummy’s feet; it became entangled, fell face</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward, and its head rolled off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seamus!” roared Professor Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus darted past Parvati. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Crack</i>!  Where  the  mummy  had  been  was  a  woman  with  floor-length</p>
<p class="calibre1">black hair and a skeletal, green-tinged face — a banshee. She opened her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek</p>
<p class="calibre1">that made the hair on Harry’s head stand on end —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>!” shouted Seamus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Crack</i>!  The  banshee  turned  into  a  rat,  which  chased  its  tail  in  a  circle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then —  <i class="calibre3">crack</i>! — became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before</p>
<p class="calibre1">—  <i class="calibre3">crack</i>! — becoming a single, bloody eyeball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s confused!” shouted Lupin. “We’re getting there! Dean!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean hurried forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Crack</i>!  The  eyeball  became  a  severed  hand,  which  flipped  over  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">began to creep along the floor like a crab. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>“<i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>!” yelled Dean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent! Ron, you next!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron leapt forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Crack</i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered in</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>!” bellowed Ron, and the spider’s legs vanished; it rolled over</p>
<p class="calibre1">and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">halt at Harry’s feet. He raised his wand, ready, but —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here!” shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Crack</i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  legless  spider  had  vanished.  For  a  second,  everyone  looked  wildly</p>
<p class="calibre1">around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the air in front of Lupin, who said, “<i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>!” almost lazily. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Crack</i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forward, Neville, and finish him off!” said Lupin as the boggart landed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  floor  as  a  cockroach.  <i class="calibre3">Crack</i>!  Snape  was  back.  This  time  Neville</p>
<p class="calibre1">charged forward looking determined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>!” he shouted, and they had a split second’s view of Snape in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  lacy  dress  before  Neville  let  out  a  great  “Ha!”  of  laughter,  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent!”  cried  Professor  Lupin  as  the  class  broke  into  applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent, Neville. Well done, everyone. … Let me see … five points to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart — ten for Neville because</p>
<p class="calibre1">he did it twice … and five each to Hermione and Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I didn’t do anything,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">class, Harry,” Lupin said lightly. “Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me …</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talking  excitedly,  the  class  left  the  staffroom.  Harry,  however,  wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling  cheerful.  Professor  Lupin  had  deliberately  stopped  him  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">tackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he’d seen Harry collapse on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">train, and thought he wasn’t up to much? Had he thought Harry would pass</p>
<p class="calibre1">out again? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>But no one else seemed to have noticed anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted Seamus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the hand!” said Dean, waving his own around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And Snape in that hat!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And my mummy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  wonder  why  Professor  Lupin’s  frightened  of  crystal  balls?”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lavender thoughtfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we’ve ever had, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t it?” said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom</p>
<p class="calibre1">to get their bags. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He seems like a very good teacher,” said Hermione approvingly. “But I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wish I could have had a turn with the boggart —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  would  it  have  been  for  you?”  said  Ron,  sniggering.  “A  piece  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">homework that only got nine out of ten?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a><img src="index-105_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Flight of the Fat Lady</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">In  no  time  at  all,  Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts  had  become  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">people’s favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything bad to say about Professor Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at the state of his robes,” Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin passed. “He dresses like our old house-elf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  no  one  else  cared  that  Professor  Lupin’s  robes  were  patched  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">frayed.  His  next  few  lessons  were  just  as  interesting  as  the  first.  After</p>
<p class="calibre1">boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures that lurked</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherever  there  had  been  bloodshed:  in  the  dungeons  of  castles  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy water-dwellers that</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">waders in their ponds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst</p>
<p class="calibre1">of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  no  one  was  in  any  doubt  why.  The  story  of  the  boggart  assuming</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grandmother’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn’t seem to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin’s name, and he was bullying Neville worse than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>Harry  was  also  growing  to  dread  the  hours  he  spent  in  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney’s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous eyes filled with</p>
<p class="calibre1">tears every time she looked at him. He couldn’t like Professor Trelawney, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  class.  Parvati  Patil  and  Lavender  Brown  had  taken  to  haunting</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney’s tower room at lunchtimes, and always returned with</p>
<p class="calibre1">annoyingly  superior  looks  on  their  faces,  as  though  they  knew  things  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others  didn’t.  They  had  also  started  using  hushed  voices  whenever  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the action-</p>
<p class="calibre1">packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the most boring creatures</p>
<p class="calibre1">in existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why  would  anyone   <i class="calibre3">bother</i>  looking  after  them?”  said  Ron,  after  yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">another  hour  of  poking  shredded  lettuce  down  the  flobberworms’  slimy</p>
<p class="calibre1">throats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  start  of  October,  however,  Harry  had  something  else  to  occupy</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,  something  so  enjoyable  it  more  than  made  up  for  his  unsatisfactory</p>
<p class="calibre1">classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and Oliver Wood, Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting one Thursday evening to discuss</p>
<p class="calibre1">tactics for the new season. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  was  to  score  goals  by  putting  the  Quaffle  (a  red,  soccer-sized  ball)</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  one  of  the  fifty-foot-high  hoops  at  each  end  of  the  field;  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beaters,  who  were  equipped  with  heavy  bats  to  repel  the  Bludgers  (two</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavy  black  balls  that  zoomed  around  trying  to  attack  the  players);  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Keeper, who defended the goal posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest</p>
<p class="calibre1">job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized</p>
<p class="calibre1">ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker’s team an extra</p>
<p class="calibre1">one hundred and fifty points. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oliver  Wood  was  a  burly  seventeen-year-old,  now  in  his  seventh  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">final year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">edge of the darkening Quidditch field. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>“This is our last chance —  <i class="calibre3">my</i> last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he told them, striding up and down in front of them. “I’ll be leaving at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of this year. I’ll never get another shot at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gryffindor  hasn’t  won  for  seven  years  now.  Okay,  so  we’ve  had  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">worst luck in the world — injuries — then the tournament getting called off</p>
<p class="calibre1">last year. …” Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump</p>
<p class="calibre1">to his throat. “But we also know we’ve got the  <i class="calibre3">best</i> —  <i class="calibre3">ruddy</i> —  <i class="calibre3">team</i> —  <i class="calibre3">in</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">—  <i class="calibre3">the</i> —  <i class="calibre3">school, </i>” he said, punching a fist into his other hand, the old manic</p>
<p class="calibre1">glint back in his eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got three  <i class="calibre3">superb</i> Chasers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood pointed at Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got two  <i class="calibre3">unbeatable</i> Beaters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop it, Oliver, you’re embarrassing us,” said Fred and George Weasley</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, pretending to blush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And we’ve got a Seeker who has  <i class="calibre3">never failed to win us a match</i>!” Wood</p>
<p class="calibre1">rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. “And me,” he added</p>
<p class="calibre1">as an afterthought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We think you’re very good too, Oliver,” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spanking good Keeper,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The point is,” Wood went on, resuming his pacing, “the Quidditch Cup</p>
<p class="calibre1">should  have  had  our  name  on  it  these  last  two  years.  Ever  since  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined the team, I’ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven’t got it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and this year’s the last chance we’ll get to finally see our name on the thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood  spoke  so  dejectedly  that  even  Fred  and  George  looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">sympathetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oliver, this year’s our year,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll do it, Oliver!” said Angelina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three evenings a</p>
<p class="calibre1">week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no</p>
<p class="calibre1">amount  of  mud,  wind,  or  rain  could  tarnish  Harry’s  wonderful  vision  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  returned  to  the  Gryffindor  common  room  one  evening  after</p>
<p class="calibre1">training, cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find</p>
<p class="calibre1">the room buzzing excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>“What’s  happened?”  he  asked  Ron  and  Hermione,  who  were  sitting  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">two  of  the  best  chairs  by  the  fireside  and  completing  some  star  charts  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astronomy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First  Hogsmeade  weekend,”  said  Ron,  pointing  at  a  notice  that  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared on the battered old bulletin board. “End of October. Halloween.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait hole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need to visit Zonko’s. I’m nearly out of Stink Pellets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione seemed to read his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  I’m  sure  you’ll  be  able  to  go  next  time,”  she  said.  “They’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">bound to catch Black soon. He’s been sighted once already” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black’s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,” said Ron. “Ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for</p>
<p class="calibre1">ages —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Ron</i>!” said Hermione. “Harry’s supposed to stay  <i class="calibre3">in school</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  can’t  be  the  only  third  year  left  behind,”  said  Ron.  “Ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall, go on, Harry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I think I will,” said Harry, making up his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks</p>
<p class="calibre1">leapt  lightly  onto  her  lap.  A  large,  dead  spider  was  dangling  from  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does he have to eat that in front of us?” said Ron, scowling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks  slowly  chewed  up  the  spider,  his  yellow  eyes  fixed</p>
<p class="calibre1">insolently on Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just keep him over there, that’s all,” said Ron irritably, turning back to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his star chart. “I’ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own star</p>
<p class="calibre1">chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out parchment, ink, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and quill, and started work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can copy mine, if you like,” said Ron, labeling his last star with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione,  who  disapproved  of  copying,  pursed  her  lips  but  didn’t  say</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything.  Crookshanks  was  still  staring  unblinkingly  at  Ron,  flicking  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OY!”  Ron  roared,  seizing  his  bag  as  Crookshanks  sank  four  sets  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">claws  deep  inside  it  and  began  tearing  ferociously.  “GET  OFF,  YOU</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>STUPID ANIMAL!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung</p>
<p class="calibre1">on, spitting and slashing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, don’t hurt him!” squealed Hermione; the whole common room was</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers came flying out of the top —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“CATCH  THAT  CAT!”  Ron  yelled  as  Crookshanks  freed  himself  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the terrified</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">George  Weasley  made  a  lunge  for  Crookshanks  but  missed;  Scabbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">streaked  through  twenty  pairs  of  legs  and  shot  beneath  an  old  chest  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawers.  Crookshanks  skidded  to  a  halt,  crouched  low  on  his  bandy  legs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the middle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at him!” he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of her. “He’s skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crookshanks doesn’t understand it’s wrong!” said Hermione, her voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking. “All cats chase rats, Ron!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s something funny about that animal!” said Ron, who was trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. “It heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">me say that Scabbers was in my bag!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  what  rubbish,”  said  Hermione  impatiently.  “Crookshanks  could</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">smell</i> him, Ron, how else d’you think —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said Ron, ignoring the people around</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,  who  were  starting  to  giggle.  “And  Scabbers  was  here  first,  <i class="calibre3">and</i>  he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">ill!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the boys’ dormitories. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her  all  through  Herbology,  even  though  he,  Harry,  and  Hermione  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">working together on the same puffapod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s  Scabbers?”  Hermione  asked  timidly  as  they  stripped  fat  pink</p>
<p class="calibre1">pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>“He’s  hiding  at  the  bottom  of  my  bed,  shaking,”  said  Ron  angrily, </p>
<p class="calibre1">missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Careful,  Weasley,  careful!”  cried  Professor  Sprout  as  the  beans  burst</p>
<p class="calibre1">into bloom before their very eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance at the front of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lavender  Brown  seemed  to  be  crying.  Parvati  had  her  arm  around  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">and was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">were looking very serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Ron went to join the group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She got a letter from home this morning,” Parvati whispered. “It’s her</p>
<p class="calibre1">rabbit, Binky. He’s been killed by a fox.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, Lavender.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should have known!” said Lavender tragically. “You know what day it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The sixteenth of October! ‘That thing you’re dreading, it will happen on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sixteenth of October!’ Remember? She was right, she was right!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head  seriously.  Hermione  hesitated;  then  she  said,  “You  —  you  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreading Binky being killed by a fox?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, not necessarily by a  <i class="calibre3">fox, </i>” said Lavender, looking up at Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">with streaming eyes, “but I was  <i class="calibre3">obviously</i> dreading him dying, wasn’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Hermione. She paused again. Then —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was Binky an  <i class="calibre3">old</i> rabbit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N — no!” sobbed Lavender. “H — he was only a baby!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender’s shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then, why would you dread him dying?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati glared at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  look  at  it  logically,”  said  Hermione,  turning  to  the  rest  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">group. “I mean, Binky didn’t even die today, did he? Lavender just got the</p>
<p class="calibre1">news  today  —”  Lavender  wailed  loudly.  “—  and  she   <i class="calibre3">can’t</i>  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>“Don’t  mind  Hermione,  Lavender,”  said  Ron  loudly,  “she  doesn’t  think</p>
<p class="calibre1">other people’s pets matter very much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and didn’t talk to each other for the whole class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  still  hadn’t  decided  what  he  was  going  to  say  to  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One moment, please!” she called as the class made to leave. “As you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">all  in  my  House,  you  should  hand  Hogsmeade  permission  forms  to  me</p>
<p class="calibre1">before Halloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don’t forget!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville put up his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, Professor, I — I think I’ve lost —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your  grandmother  sent  yours  to  me  directly,  Longbottom,”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall. “She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that’s all, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you may leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask her now,” Ron hissed at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, but —” Hermione began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go for it, Harry,” said Ron stubbornly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed nervously</p>
<p class="calibre1">for Professor McGonagall’s desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took a deep breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor, my aunt and uncle — er — forgot to sign my form,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  McGonagall  looked  over  her  square  spectacles  at  him  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t say anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So — er — d’you think it would be all right — I mean, will it be okay if</p>
<p class="calibre1">I — if I go to Hogsmeade?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  McGonagall  looked  down  and  began  shuffling  papers  on  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  afraid  not,  Potter,”  she  said.  “You  heard  what  I  said.  No  form,  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">visiting the village. That’s the rule.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  —  Professor,  my  aunt  and  uncle  —  you  know,  they’re  Muggles, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  don’t  really  understand  about  —  about  Hogwarts  forms  and  stuff,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  said,  while  Ron  egged  him  on  with  vigorous  nods.  “If  you  said  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could go —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>“But I don’t say so,” said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling</p>
<p class="calibre1">her papers neatly into a drawer. “The form clearly states that the parent or</p>
<p class="calibre1">guardian  must  give  permission.”  She  turned  to  look  at  him,  with  an  odd</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression on her face. Was it pity? “I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s my final</p>
<p class="calibre1">word. You had better hurry, or you’ll be late for your next lesson.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of</p>
<p class="calibre1">names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an “all-for-the-</p>
<p class="calibre1">best”  expression  that  made  Ron  even  angrier,  and  Harry  had  to  endure</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry up. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  coming  to  it  after  a  day  in  Hogsmeade  with  everyone  else.  Nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone  said  made  him  feel  any  better  about  being  left  behind.  Dean</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas,  who  was  good  with  a  quill,  had  offered  to  forge  Uncle  Vernon’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall</p>
<p class="calibre1">he hadn’t had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedly suggested the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it’s not all</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s cracked up to be,” he said seriously. “All right, the sweetshop’s rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">good, and Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shack’s always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from that, you’re not</p>
<p class="calibre1">missing anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">On  Halloween  morning,  Harry  awoke  with  the  rest  and  went  down  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakfast,  feeling  thoroughly  depressed,  though  doing  his  best  to  act</p>
<p class="calibre1">normally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,” said Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking desperately sorry for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,  loads,”  said  Ron.  He  and  Hermione  had  finally  forgotten  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry’s difficulties. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>“Don’t  worry  about  me,”  said  Harry,  in  what  he  hoped  was  an  offhand</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  accompanied  them  to  the  entrance  hall,  where  Filch,  the  caretaker, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, </p>
<p class="calibre1">peering  suspiciously  into  every  face,  and  making  sure  that  no  one  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sneaking out who shouldn’t be going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Staying  here,  Potter?”  shouted  Malfoy,  who  was  standing  in  line  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  ignored  him  and  made  his  solitary  way  up  the  marble  staircase, </p>
<p class="calibre1">through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  portrait  swung  open  and  he  climbed  through  the  hole  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">common  room.  It  was  full  of  chattering  first  and  second  years,  and  a  few</p>
<p class="calibre1">older students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty</p>
<p class="calibre1">had worn off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and</p>
<p class="calibre1">never missed an opportunity to speak to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t  you  going  to  Hogsmeade,  Harry?  Why  not?  Hey”  —  Colin</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked eagerly around at his friends — “you can come and sit with us, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you like, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said Harry, who wasn’t in the mood to have a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. “I — I’ve got to go</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the library, got to get some work done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the portrait hole again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was the point waking me up?” the Fat Lady called grumpily after</p>
<p class="calibre1">him as he walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  wandered  dispiritedly  toward  the  library,  but  halfway  there  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed his mind; he didn’t feel like working. He turned around and came</p>
<p class="calibre1">face-to-face  with  Filch,  who  had  obviously  just  seen  off  the  last  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogsmeade visitors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing?” Filch snarled suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing!” spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. “A likely story! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sneaking  around  on  your  own  —  why  aren’t  you  in  Hogsmeade  buying</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your</p>
<p class="calibre1">nasty little friends?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  get  back  to  your  common  room  where  you  belong!”  snapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch, and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry didn’t go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking  vaguely  of  visiting  the  Owlery  to  see  Hedwig,  and  was  walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">along  another  corridor  when  a  voice  from  inside  one  of  the  rooms  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  doubled  back  to  see  who  had  spoken  and  met  Professor  Lupin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking around his office door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing?” said Lupin, though in a very different voice from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch. “Where are Ron and Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hogsmeade,” said Harry, in a would-be casual voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. “Why don’t you</p>
<p class="calibre1">come in? I’ve just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A what?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank of</p>
<p class="calibre1">water.  A  sickly  green  creature  with  sharp  little  horns  had  its  face  pressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Water  demon,”  said  Lupin,  surveying  the  grindylow  thoughtfully.  “We</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldn’t have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is</p>
<p class="calibre1">to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very</p>
<p class="calibre1">brittle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeds in a corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cup  of  tea?”  Lupin  said,  looking  around  for  his  kettle.  “I  was  just</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking of making one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” said Harry awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  tapped  the  kettle  with  his  wand  and  a  blast  of  steam  issued</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly from the spout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit  down,”  said  Lupin,  taking  the  lid  off  a  dusty  tin.  “I’ve  only  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay you’ve had enough of tea leaves?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at him. Lupin’s eyes were twinkling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you know about that?” Harry asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor  McGonagall  told  me,”  said  Lupin,  passing  Harry  a  chipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">mug of tea. “You’re not worried, are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>“No,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  thought  for  a  moment  of  telling  Lupin  about  the  dog  he’d  seen  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn’t want Lupin to think he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a coward, especially since Lupin already seemed to think he couldn’t cope</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a boggart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something  of  Harry’s  thoughts  seemed  to  have  shown  on  his  face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because Lupin said, “Anything worrying you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”  Harry  lied.  He  drank  a  bit  of  tea  and  watched  the  grindylow</p>
<p class="calibre1">brandishing a fist at him. “Yes,” he said suddenly, putting his tea down on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin’s desk. “You know that day we fought the boggart? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Lupin slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why didn’t you let me fight it?” said Harry abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin raised his eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  would  have  thought  that  was  obvious,  Harry,”  he  said,  sounding</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  who  had  expected  Lupin  to  deny  that  he’d  done  any  such  thing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” he said again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”  said  Lupin,  frowning  slightly,  “I  assumed  that  if  the  boggart</p>
<p class="calibre1">faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he’d expected, but Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">had said Voldemort’s name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the</p>
<p class="calibre1">name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. “But I didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">think  it  a  good  idea  for  Lord  Voldemort  to  materialize  in  the  staffroom.  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined that people would panic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly. “I — I remembered</p>
<p class="calibre1">those dementors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  see,”  said  Lupin  thoughtfully.  “Well,  well  …  I’m  impressed.”  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry’s face. “That suggests that</p>
<p class="calibre1">what you fear most of all is — fear. Very wise, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he drank some more tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you capable of fighting the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boggart?” said Lupin shrewdly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well  …  yeah,”  said  Harry.  He  was  suddenly  feeling  a  lot  happier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Lupin, you know the dementors —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was interrupted by a knock on the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>“Come in,” called Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  smoking  faintly,  and  stopped  at  the  sight  of  Harry,  his  black  eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Severus,” said Lupin, smiling. “Thanks very much. Could you leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">it here on the desk for me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  was  just  showing  Harry  my  grindylow,”  said  Lupin  pleasantly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pointing at the tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it. “You should drink that</p>
<p class="calibre1">directly, Lupin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes, I will,” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I made an entire cauldronful,” Snape continued. “If you need more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  should  probably  take  some  again  tomorrow.  Thanks  very  much, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Severus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not at all,” said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn’t like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,” he said. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  never  been  much  of  a  potion-brewer  and  this  one  is  particularly</p>
<p class="calibre1">complex.”  He  picked  up  the  goblet  and  sniffed  it.  “Pity  sugar  makes  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why  —  ?”  Harry  began.  Lupin  looked  at  him  and  answered  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfinished question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been feeling a bit off-color,” he said. “This potion is the only thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there</p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’t many wizards who are up to making it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the</p>
<p class="calibre1">goblet out of his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Snape’s very interested in the Dark Arts,” he blurted out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another</p>
<p class="calibre1">gulp of potion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some  people  reckon  —”  Harry  hesitated,  then  plunged  recklessly  on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“some people reckon he’d do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arts job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>“Disgusting,” he said. “Well, Harry, I’d better get back to work. I’ll see</p>
<p class="calibre1">you at the feast later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry, putting down his empty teacup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The empty goblet was still smoking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“There you go,” said Ron. “We got as much as we could carry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry’s lap. It was dusk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the cold wind and looking as though they’d had the time of their lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”  said  Harry,  picking  up  a  packet  of  tiny  black  Pepper  Imps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  sound  of  it  —  everywhere.  Dervish  and  Banges,  the  wizarding</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment  shop,  Zonko’s  Joke  Shop,  into  the  Three  Broomsticks  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honeydukes  has  got  a  new  kind  of  fudge;  they  were  giving  out  free</p>
<p class="calibre1">samples, there’s a bit, look —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We   <i class="calibre3">think</i>  we  saw  an  ogre,  honestly,  they  get  all  sorts  at  the  Three</p>
<p class="calibre1">Broomsticks —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you do?” said Hermione, looking anxious. “Did you get any</p>
<p class="calibre1">work done?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. “Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape came in. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He told them all about the goblet. Ron’s mouth fell open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Lupin drank it</i>?” he gasped. “Is he mad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione checked her watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be starting in five minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…”  They  hurried  through  the  portrait  hole  and  into  the  crowd,  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">discussing Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  if  he  —  you  know”  —  Hermione  dropped  her  voice,  glancing</p>
<p class="calibre1">nervously around — “if he  <i class="calibre3">was</i> trying to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">have done it in front of Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, maybe,” said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed</p>
<p class="calibre1">into  the  Great  Hall.  It  had  been  decorated  with  hundreds  and  hundreds  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>candle-filled  pumpkins,  a  cloud  of  fluttering  live  bats,  and  many  flaming</p>
<p class="calibre1">orange  streamers,  which  were  swimming  lazily  across  the  stormy  ceiling</p>
<p class="calibre1">like brilliant watersnakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  food  was  delicious;  even  Hermione  and  Ron,  who  were  full  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin looked cheerful and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  well  as  he  ever  did;  he  was  talking  animatedly  to  tiny  little  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape’s eyes flickering</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward Lupin more often than was natural? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  feast  finished  with  an  entertainment  provided  by  the  Hogwarts</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghosts.  They  popped  out  of  the  walls  and  tables  to  do  a  bit  of  formation</p>
<p class="calibre1">gliding;  Nearly  Headless  Nick,  the  Gryffindor  ghost,  had  a  great  success</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a reenactment of his own botched beheading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  had  been  such  a  pleasant  evening  that  Harry’s  good  mood  couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hall, “The dementors send their love, Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual  path  to  Gryffindor  Tower,  but  when  they  reached  the  corridor  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let  me  through,  please,”  came  Percy’s  voice,  and  he  came  bustling</p>
<p class="calibre1">importantly through the crowd. “What’s the holdup here? You can’t all have</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten the password — excuse me, I’m Head Boy —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed  to  spread  down  the  corridor.  They  heard  Percy  say,  in  a  suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharp voice, “Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">People’s heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on?” said Ginny, who had just arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the</p>
<p class="calibre1">portrait;  the  Gryffindors  squeezed  together  to  let  him  through,  and  Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, my —” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so</p>
<p class="calibre1">viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>torn away completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore  took  one  quick  look  at  the  ruined  painting  and  turned,  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes  somber,  to  see  Professors  McGonagall,  Lupin,  and  Snape  hurrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to find her,” said Dumbledore. “Professor McGonagall, please</p>
<p class="calibre1">go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Fat Lady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll be lucky!” said a cackling voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  Peeves  the  Poltergeist,  bobbing  over  the  crowd  and  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  do  you  mean,  Peeves?”  said  Dumbledore  calmly,  and  Peeves’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">grin faded a little. He didn’t dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an</p>
<p class="calibre1">oily voice that was no better than his cackle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn’t want to be seen. She’s a horrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">mess.  Saw  her  running  through  the  landscape  up  on  the  fourth  floor,  sir, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dodging  between  the  trees.  Crying  something  dreadful,”  he  said  happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor thing,” he added unconvincingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did she say who did it?” said Dumbledore quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, Professorhead,” said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a large</p>
<p class="calibre1">bombshell in his arms. “He got very angry when she wouldn’t let him in, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you see.” Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from between his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own legs. “Nasty temper he’s got, that Sirius Black.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a><img src="index-120_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Grim Defeat</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Dumbledore  sent  all  the  Gryffindors  back  to  the  Great  Hall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from Hufflepuff, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  teachers  and  I  need  to  conduct  a  thorough  search  of  the  castle,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Dumbledore  told  them  as  Professors  McGonagall  and  Flitwick</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed all doors into the hall. “I’m afraid that, for your own safety, you will</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  to  spend  the  night  here.  I  want  the  prefects  to  stand  guard  over  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any</p>
<p class="calibre1">disturbance should be reported to me immediately,” he added to Percy, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">was looking immensely proud and important. “Send word with one of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghosts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, “Oh, yes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ll be needing …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sleep well,” said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hall  immediately  began  to  buzz  excitedly;  the  Gryffindors  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling the rest of the school what had just happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>“Everyone into their sleeping bags!” shouted Percy. “Come on, now, no</p>
<p class="calibre1">more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon,”  Ron  said  to  Harry  and  Hermione;  they  seized  three  sleeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">bags and dragged them into a corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do  you  think  Black’s  still  in  the  castle?”  Hermione  whispered</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  very  lucky  he  picked  tonight,  you  know,”  said  Hermione  as  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbed  fully  dressed  into  their  sleeping  bags  and  propped  themselves  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">their elbows to talk. “The one night we weren’t in the tower. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  reckon  he’s  lost  track  of  time,  being  on  the  run,”  said  Ron.  “Didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he’d have come bursting in here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione shuddered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  around  them,  people  were  asking  one  another  the  same  question:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">How did he get in</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe he knows how to Apparate,” said a Ravenclaw a few feet away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just appear out of thin air, you know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Disguised himself, probably,” said a Hufflepuff fifth year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He could’ve flown in,” suggested Dean Thomas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honestly, am I the  <i class="calibre3">only</i> person who’s ever bothered to read  <i class="calibre3">Hogwarts, A</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">History</i>?” said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably,” said Ron. “Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because  the  castle’s  protected  by  more  than   <i class="calibre3">walls, </i>  you  know,”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione.  “There  are  all  sorts  of  enchantments  on  it,  to  stop  people</p>
<p class="calibre1">entering by stealth. You can’t just Apparate in here. And I’d like to see the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disguise  that  could  fool  those  dementors.  They’re  guarding  every  single</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance to the grounds. They’d have seen him fly in too. And Filch knows</p>
<p class="calibre1">all the secret passages, they’ll have them covered. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The lights are going out now!” Percy shouted. “I want everyone in their</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleeping bags and no more talking!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  candles  all  went  out  at  once.  The  only  light  now  came  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was scattered with stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  with  that,  and  the  whispering  that  still  filled  the  hall,  Harry  felt  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  every  hour,  a  teacher  would  reappear  in  the  hall  to  check  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything  was  quiet.  Around  three  in  the  morning,  when  many  students</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>had  finally  fallen  asleep,  Professor  Dumbledore  came  in.  Harry  watched</p>
<p class="calibre1">him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">bags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione,  who  quickly  pretended  to  be  asleep  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s footsteps drew nearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any sign of him, Professor?” asked Percy in a whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. All well here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything under control, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.  There’s  no  point  moving  them  all  now.  I’ve  found  a  temporary</p>
<p class="calibre1">guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You’ll be able to move them back</p>
<p class="calibre1">in tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the Fat Lady, sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hiding  in  a  map  of  Argyllshire  on  the  second  floor.  Apparently  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She’s still very</p>
<p class="calibre1">distressed, but once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr. Filch restore her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Headmaster?” It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole  of  the  third  floor  has  been  searched.  He’s  not  there.  And  Filch  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">done the dungeons; nothing there either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  about  the  Astronomy  tower?  Professor  Trelawney’s  room?  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Owlery?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All searched …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well, Severus. I didn’t really expect Black to linger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?” asked Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  opened  his  eyes  a  fraction  and  squinted  up  to  where  they  stood; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s  back  was  to  him,  but  he  could  see  Percy’s  face,  rapt  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention, and Snape’s profile, which looked angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before — ah</p>
<p class="calibre1">—  the  start  of  term?”  said  Snape,  who  was  barely  opening  his  lips,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though trying to block Percy out of the conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do, Severus,” said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  seems  —  almost  impossible  —  that  Black  could  have  entered  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">school without inside help. I did express my concerns when you appointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>“I  do  not  believe  a  single  person  inside  this  castle  would  have  helped</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  enter  it,”  said  Dumbledore,  and  his  tone  made  it  so  clear  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject  was  closed  that  Snape  didn’t  reply.  “I  must  go  down  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors,” said Dumbledore. “I said I would inform them when our search</p>
<p class="calibre1">was complete.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t they want to help, sir?” said Percy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh  yes,”  said  Dumbledore  coldly.  “But  I’m  afraid  no  dementor  will</p>
<p class="calibre1">cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  quietly.  Snape  stood  for  a  moment,  watching  the  headmaster  with  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  glanced  sideways  at  Ron  and  Hermione.  Both  of  them  had  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes open too, reflecting the starry ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was all that about?” Ron mouthed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">theories  about  how  he  had  entered  the  castle  became  wilder  and  wilder; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling anyone who’d listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  portrait  of  Sir  Cadogan  and  his  fat  gray  pony.  Nobody  was  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy  about  this.  Sir  Cadogan  spent  half  his  time  challenging  people  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">he changed at least twice a day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s a complete lunatic,” said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. “Can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">we get anyone else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said Percy. “Frightened of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">to volunteer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir  Cadogan,  however,  was  the  least  of  Harry’s  worries.  He  was  now</p>
<p class="calibre1">being closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother’s orders)</p>
<p class="calibre1">was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap it</p>
<p class="calibre1">all,  Professor  McGonagall  summoned  Harry  into  her  office,  with  such  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  no  point  hiding  it  from  you  any  longer,  Potter,”  she  said  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very  serious  voice.  “I  know  this  will  come  as  a  shock  to  you,  but  Sirius</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>Black —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know he’s after me,” said Harry wearily. “I heard Ron’s dad telling his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  moment  or  two,  then  said,  “I  see!  Well,  in  that  case,  Potter,  you’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand  why  I  don’t  think  it’s  a  good  idea  for  you  to  be  practicing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only your team members, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s very exposed, Potter —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry, outraged. “I’ve got</p>
<p class="calibre1">to train, Professor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  McGonagall  considered  him  intently.  Harry  knew  she  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeply interested in the Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, who’d suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited, holding his</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm …” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  Quidditch  field,  just  visible  through  the  rain.  “Well  …  goodness</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at last … but all the same, Potter …</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee</p>
<p class="calibre1">your training sessions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Madam  Hooch.  Then,  at  their  final  training  session  before  Saturday’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking very angry. “Flint’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">just been to see me. We’re playing Hufflepuff instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” chorused the rest of the team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Flint’s  excuse  is  that  their  Seeker’s  arm’s  still  injured,”  said  Wood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">grinding  his  teeth  furiously.  “But  it’s  obvious  why  they’re  doing  it.  Don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to play in this weather. Think it’ll damage their chances. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they heard a distant rumble of thunder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  <i class="calibre3">nothing wrong</i> with Malfoy’s arm!” said Harry furiously. “He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">faking it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know that, but we can’t prove it,” said Wood bitterly. “And we’ve been</p>
<p class="calibre1">practicing  all  those  moves  assuming  we’re  playing  Slytherin,  and  instead</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>it’s Hufflepuff, and their style’s quite different. They’ve got a new Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Seeker, Cedric Diggory —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said Angelina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strong and silent,” said Katie, and they started to giggle again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  only  silent  because  he’s  too  thick  to  string  two  words  together,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Fred impatiently. “I don’t know why you’re worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff</p>
<p class="calibre1">is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in about</p>
<p class="calibre1">five minutes, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were playing in completely different conditions!” Wood shouted, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes  bulging  slightly.  “Diggory’s  put  a  very  strong  side  together!  He’s  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">excellent Seeker! I was afraid you’d take it like this! We mustn’t relax! We</p>
<p class="calibre1">must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We  <i class="calibre3">must</i> win!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. “We’re taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hufflepuff very seriously.  <i class="calibre3">Seriously. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain</p>
<p class="calibre1">fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that</p>
<p class="calibre1">extra  torches  and  lanterns  were  lit.  The  Slytherin  team  was  looking  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,  if  only  my  arm  was  feeling  a  bit  better!”  he  sighed  as  the  gale</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside pounded the windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match</p>
<p class="calibre1">tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly  realized  he  was  ten  minutes  late  for  Defense  Against  the  Dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, “Diggory’s got a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  skidded  to  a  halt  outside  the  Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts</p>
<p class="calibre1">classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin, I —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it wasn’t Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk; it was Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we’ll make it ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">points from Gryffindor. Sit down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry didn’t move. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>“Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said Snape with a twisted</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile. “I believe I told you to sit down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry stayed where he was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong with him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s black eyes glittered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though he wished it were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Five  more  points  from  Gryffindor,  and  if  I  have  to  ask  you  to  sit  down</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, it will be fifty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  walked  slowly  to  his  seat  and  sat  down.  Snape  looked  around  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left</p>
<p class="calibre1">any record of the topics you have covered so far —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,  sir,  we’ve  done  boggarts,  Red  Caps,  kappas,  and  grindylows,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione quickly, “and we’re just about to start —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be  quiet,”  said  Snape  coldly.  “I  did  not  ask  for  information.  I  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">merely commenting on Professor Lupin’s lack of organization.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever had,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  are  easily  satisfied.  Lupin  is  hardly  overtaxing  you  —  I  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today</p>
<p class="calibre1">we shall discuss —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which he must know they hadn’t covered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— werewolves,” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,  sir,”  said  Hermione,  seemingly  unable  to  restrain  herself,  “we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">not supposed to do werewolves yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss Granger,” said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, “I was under the</p>
<p class="calibre1">impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all</p>
<p class="calibre1">to turn to page 394.” He glanced around again. “<i class="calibre3">All</i> of you!  <i class="calibre3">Now</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  many  bitter  sidelong  looks  and  some  sullen  muttering,  the  class</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened their books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the true wolf?” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone  sat  in  motionless  silence;  everyone  except  Hermione,  whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>“Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn’t even taught you the basic</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinction between —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  told  you,”  said  Parvati  suddenly,  “we  haven’t  got  as  far  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">werewolves yet, we’re still on —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Silence</i>!”  snarled  Snape.  “Well,  well,  well,  I  never  thought  I’d  meet  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">third-year  class  who  wouldn’t  even  recognize  a  werewolf  when  they  saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">one.  I  shall  make  a  point  of  informing  Professor  Dumbledore  how  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind you all are. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,  sir,”  said  Hermione,  whose  hand  was  still  in  the  air,  “the</p>
<p class="calibre1">werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">werewolf —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  is  the  second  time  you  have  spoken  out  of  turn,  Miss  Granger,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said  Snape  coolly.  “Five  more  points  from  Gryffindor  for  being  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">insufferable know-it-all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  were  all  glaring  at  him,  because  every  one  of  them  had  called</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  know-it-all  at  least  twice  a  week,  said  loudly,  “You  asked  us  a  question</p>
<p class="calibre1">and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want to be told?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  class  knew  instantly  he’d  gone  too  far.  Snape  advanced  on  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly, and the room held its breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Detention,  Weasley,”  Snape  said  silkily,  his  face  very  close  to  Ron’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be</p>
<p class="calibre1">very sorry indeed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  one  made  a  sound  throughout  the  rest  of  the  lesson.  They  sat  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and</p>
<p class="calibre1">down  the  rows  of  desks,  examining  the  work  they  had  been  doing  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very poorly explained … That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly</p>
<p class="calibre1">found  in  Mongolia.  …  Professor  Lupin  gave  this  eight  out  of  ten?  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t have given it three. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize  and  kill  werewolves.  I  want  two  rolls  of  parchment  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this</p>
<p class="calibre1">class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited</p>
<p class="calibre1">until  they  were  well  out  of  earshot,  then  burst  into  a  furious  tirade  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,” Harry said to Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why’s  he  got  it  in  for  Lupin?  D’you  think  this  is  all  because  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boggart?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  know,”  said  Hermione  pensively.  “But  I  really  hope  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin gets better soon. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you  know  what  that  —”  (he  called  Snape  something  that  made</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  say  “<i class="calibre3">Ron</i>!”)  “—  is  making  me  do?  I’ve  got  to  scrub  out  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedpans in the hospital wing.  <i class="calibre3">Without magic</i>!” He was breathing deeply, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fists clenched. “Why couldn’t Black have hidden in Snape’s office, eh? He</p>
<p class="calibre1">could have finished him off for us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  woke  extremely  early  the  next  morning;  so  early  that  it  was  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark.  For  a  moment  he  thought  the  roaring  of  the  wind  had  woken  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Peeves  the  Poltergeist  had  been  floating  next  to  him,  blowing  hard  in  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you do that for?” said Harry furiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peeves  puffed  out  his  cheeks,  blew  hard,  and  zoomed  backward  out  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the room, cackling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult,  now  that  he  was  awake,  to  ignore  the  sounds  of  the  thunder</p>
<p class="calibre1">rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Harry  opened  the  door,  something  brushed  against  his  leg.  He  bent</p>
<p class="calibre1">down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag</p>
<p class="calibre1">him outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>“You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry told Crookshanks</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspiciously. “There are plenty of mice around this place — go and chase</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.  Go  on,”  he  added,  nudging  Crookshanks  down  the  spiral  staircase</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his foot. “Leave Scabbers alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  noise  of  the  storm  was  even  louder  in  the  common  room.  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches</p>
<p class="calibre1">weren’t  called  off  for  trifles  like  thunderstorms.  Nevertheless,  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seekers were usually light and speedy, but Diggory’s weight would be an</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  whiled  away  the  hours  until  dawn  in  front  of  the  fire,  getting  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">every  now  and  then  to  stop  Crookshanks  from  sneaking  up  the  boys’</p>
<p class="calibre1">staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">he headed through the portrait hole alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  revived  a  bit  over  a  large  bowl  of  porridge,  and  by  the  time  he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s going to be a tough one,” said Wood, who wasn’t eating anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we don’t mind a bit of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  they  ran  down  the  lawns  toward  the  Quidditch  field,  heads  bowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  went.  Just  before  he  entered  the  locker  room,  Harry  saw  Malfoy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous</p>
<p class="calibre1">umbrella on their way to the stadium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  team  changed  into  their  scarlet  robes  and  waited  for  Wood’s  usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">pre-match  pep  talk,  but  it  didn’t  come.  He  tried  to  speak  several  times, </p>
<p class="calibre1">made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">them to follow him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn’t hear it over the fresh</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolls  of  thunder.  Rain  was  splattering  over  Harry’s  glasses.  How  on  earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">was he going to see the Snitch in this? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>The  Hufflepuffs  were  approaching  from  the  opposite  side  of  the  field, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing  canary-yellow  robes.  The  Captains  walked  up  to  each  other  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood now looked as though he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  lockjaw  and  merely  nodded.  Harry  saw  Madam  Hooch’s  mouth  form</p>
<p class="calibre1">the words, “Mount your brooms.” He pulled his right foot out of the mud</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  squelch  and  swung  it  over  his  Nimbus  Two  Thousand.  Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and</p>
<p class="calibre1">distant — they were off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  see  his  teammates,  let  alone  the  tiny  Snitch.  He  flew  backward  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  was  happening  in  the  rest  of  the  game.  He  couldn’t  hear  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn’t seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">them coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided to come</p>
<p class="calibre1">early.  Twice  Harry  nearly  hit  another  player,  without  knowing  whether  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a  teammate  or  opponent;  everyone  was  now  so  wet,  and  the  rain  so</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick, he could hardly tell them apart. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  first  flash  of  lightning  came  the  sound  of  Madam  Hooch’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">whistle;  Harry  could  just  see  the  outline  of  Wood  through  the  thick  rain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the mud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I called for time-out!” Wood roared at his team. “Come on, under here</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took</p>
<p class="calibre1">off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the score?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get the Snitch soon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ll be playing into the night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said exasperatedly, waving his</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  that  very  moment,  Hermione  appeared  at  his  shoulder;  she  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>“I’ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  handed  them  to  her,  and  as  the  team  watched  in  amazement, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione tapped them with her wand and said, “<i class="calibre3">Impervius</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!” she said, handing them back to Harry. “They’ll repel water!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood looked as though he could have kissed her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brilliant!”  he  called  hoarsely  after  her  as  she  disappeared  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crowd. “Okay, team, let’s go for it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold, still</p>
<p class="calibre1">wetter  than  he’d  ever  been  in  his  life,  but  he  could  see.  Full  of  fresh</p>
<p class="calibre1">determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in every</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">was streaking in the opposite direction. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  another  clap  of  thunder,  followed  immediately  by  forked</p>
<p class="calibre1">lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Snitch quickly —</p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  moment,  another  flash  of  lightning  illuminated  the  stands,  and  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw  something  that  distracted  him  completely  —  the  silhouette  of  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous  shaggy  black  dog,  clearly  imprinted  against  the  sky,  motionless</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the topmost, empty row of seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  numb  hands  slipped  on  the  broom  handle  and  his  Nimbus</p>
<p class="calibre1">dropped a few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted</p>
<p class="calibre1">back into the stands. The dog had vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!”  came  Wood’s  anguished  yell  from  the  Gryffindor  goal  posts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, behind you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them —</p>
<p class="calibre1">With  a  jolt  of  panic,  Harry  threw  himself  flat  to  the  broom-handle  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">zoomed toward the Snitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come  on!”  he  growled  at  his  Nimbus  as  the  rain  whipped  his  face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Faster</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  something  odd  was  happening.  An  eerie  silence  was  falling  across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly deaf — what was going on? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  then  a  horribly  familiar  wave  of  cold  swept  over  him,  inside  him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">just as he became aware of something moving on the field below. …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>Before  he’d  had  time  to  think,  Harry  had  taken  his  eyes  off  the  Snitch</p>
<p class="calibre1">and looked down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing  beneath  him.  It  was  as  though  freezing  water  were  rising  in  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. … Someone was</p>
<p class="calibre1">screaming, screaming inside his head … a woman …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Stand aside, you silly girl</i> …  <i class="calibre3">stand aside, now. …</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry’s brain. … What was he</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her. … She was going to die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">… She was going to be murdered. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was falling, falling through the icy mist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Not Harry</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Please</i> …  <i class="calibre3">have mercy</i> …  <i class="calibre3">have mercy. …</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">no more. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Lucky the ground was so soft.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought he was dead for sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he didn’t even break his glasses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  could  hear  the  voices  whispering,  but  they  made  no  sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever. He didn’t have a clue where he was, or how he’d got there, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">what he’d been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch</p>
<p class="calibre1">of him was aching as though it had been beaten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scariest  …  the  scariest  thing  …  hooded  black  figures  …  cold  …</p>
<p class="calibre1">screaming …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  eyes  snapped  open.  He  was  lying  in  the  hospital  wing.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor  Quidditch  team,  spattered  with  mud  from  head  to  foot,  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathered  around  his  bed.  Ron  and  Hermione  were  also  there,  looking  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though they’d just climbed out of a swimming pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!”  said  Fred,  who  looked  extremely  white  underneath  the  mud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’re you feeling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was as though Harry’s memory was on fast forward. The lightning —</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Grim — the Snitch — and the dementors …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What happened?” he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You fell off,” said Fred. “Must’ve been — what — fifty feet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>“We thought you’d died,” said Alicia, who was shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  made  a  small,  squeaky  noise.  Her  eyes  were  extremely</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloodshot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But the match,” said Harry. “What happened? Are we doing a replay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We didn’t —  <i class="calibre3">lose</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Diggory  got  the  Snitch,”  said  George.  “Just  after  you  fell.  He  didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">realize  what  had  happened.  When  he  looked  back  and  saw  you  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground,  he  tried  to  call  it  off.  Wanted  a  rematch.  But  they  won  fair  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">square … even Wood admits it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn’t there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still  in  the  showers,”  said  Fred.  “We  think  he’s  trying  to  drown</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">his shoulder and shook it roughly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred points, right? So if</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if they beat Ravenclaw …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No  way,  Ravenclaw  is  too  good.  But  if  Slytherin  loses  against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hufflepuff …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  lay  there,  not  saying  a  word.  They  had  lost  …  for  the  first  time</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever, he had lost a Quidditch match. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave him in peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll come and see you later,” Fred told him. “Don’t beat yourself up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, you’re still the best Seeker we’ve ever had.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  team  trooped  out,  trailing  mud  behind  them.  Madam  Pomfrey  shut</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  door  behind  them,  looking  disapproving.  Ron  and  Hermione  moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearer to Harry’s bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a quaking voice. “I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand,  and  you  sort  of  slowed  down  before  you  hit  the  ground.  Then  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>stadium right away. … He was furious they’d come onto the grounds. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard him —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,” said Ron. “And walked up to</p>
<p class="calibre1">school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dementors had done to him … about the screaming voice. He looked up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and saw Ron and Hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast</p>
<p class="calibre1">around for something matter-of-fact to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did someone get my Nimbus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry, looking from one to the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well … when you fell off, it got blown away,” said Hermione hesitantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree</p>
<p class="calibre1">that stood alone in the middle of the grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And?” he said, dreading the answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you know the Whomping Willow,” said Ron. “It — it doesn’t like</p>
<p class="calibre1">being hit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor  Flitwick  brought  it  back  just  before  you  came  around,”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione in a very small voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,  she  reached  down  for  a  bag  at  her  feet,  turned  it  upside  down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only</p>
<p class="calibre1">remains of Harry’s faithful, finally beaten broomstick. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a><img src="index-135_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Marauder’s Map</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest of the weekend. He didn’t argue or complain, but he wouldn’t let her</p>
<p class="calibre1">throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  was  being  stupid,  knew  that  the  Nimbus  was  beyond  repair,  but  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t help it; he felt as though he’d lost one of his best friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  a  stream  of  visitors,  all  intent  on  cheering  him  up.  Hagrid  sent</p>
<p class="calibre1">him  a  bunch  of  earwiggy  flowers  that  looked  like  yellow  cabbages,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had</p>
<p class="calibre1">made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruit.  The  Gryffindor  team  visited  again  on  Sunday  morning,  this  time</p>
<p class="calibre1">accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he didn’t blame him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry’s bedside</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  at  night.  But  nothing  anyone  said  or  did  could  make  Harry  feel  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  hadn’t  told  anyone  about  the  Grim,  not  even  Ron  and  Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  he  knew  Ron  would  panic  and  Hermione  would  scoff.  The  fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly been</p>
<p class="calibre1">run  over  by  the  Knight  Bus;  the  second,  fallen  fifty  feet  from  his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was</p>
<p class="calibre1">he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every</p>
<p class="calibre1">time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but no</p>
<p class="calibre1">one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard echoes</p>
<p class="calibre1">in their head of their dying parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  ceiling.  When  the  dementors  approached  him,  he  heard  the  last</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments of his mother’s life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord</p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort,  and  Voldemort’s  laughter  before  he  murdered  her.  …  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">dozed  fitfully,  sinking  into  dreams  full  of  clammy,  rotted  hands  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  relief  to  return  to  the  noise  and  bustle  of  the  main  school  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, even if he had to</p>
<p class="calibre1">endure  Draco  Malfoy’s  taunting.  Malfoy  was  almost  beside  himself  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">glee  at  Gryffindor’s  defeat.  He  had  finally  taken  off  his  bandages,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">celebrated  having  the  full  use  of  both  arms  again  by  doing  spirited</p>
<p class="calibre1">imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potions  class  doing  dementor  imitations  across  the  dungeon;  Ron  finally</p>
<p class="calibre1">cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If  Snape’s  teaching  Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts  again,  I’m  skiving</p>
<p class="calibre1">off,” said Ron as they headed toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch. “Check</p>
<p class="calibre1">who’s in there, Hermione.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione peered around the classroom door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they</p>
<p class="calibre1">took  their  seats,  and  they  burst  at  once  into  an  explosion  of  complaints</p>
<p class="calibre1">about Snape’s behavior while Lupin had been ill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We don’t know anything about werewolves —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— two rolls of parchment!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>“Did  you  tell  Professor  Snape  we  haven’t  covered  them  yet?”  Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked, frowning slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The babble broke out again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but he said we were really behind —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— he wouldn’t listen —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—  <i class="calibre3">two</i>  <i class="calibre3">rolls of parchment</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  worry.  I’ll  speak  to  Professor  Snape.  You  don’t  have  to  do  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">essay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh   <i class="calibre3">no, </i>”  said  Hermione,  looking  very  disappointed.  “I’ve  already</p>
<p class="calibre1">finished it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  though  he  were  made  of  wisps  of  smoke,  rather  frail  and  harmless-</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lures  travelers  into  bogs,”  said  Professor  Lupin  as  they  took  notes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  notice  the  lantern  dangling  from  his  hand?  Hops  ahead  —  people</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow the light — then —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door, Harry among them, but —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait a moment, Harry,” Lupin called. “I’d like a word.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  doubled  back  and  watched  Professor  Lupin  covering  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hinkypunk’s box with a cloth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  heard  about  the  match,”  said  Lupin,  turning  back  to  his  desk  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting  to  pile  books  into  his  briefcase,  “and  I’m  sorry  about  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. “The tree smashed it to bits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They  planted  the  Whomping  Willow  the  same  year  that  I  arrived  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch</p>
<p class="calibre1">the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you hear about the dementors too?” said Harry with difficulty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin looked at him quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I did. I don’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that</p>
<p class="calibre1">angry.  They  have  been  growing  restless  for  some  time  …  furious  at  his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>refusal  to  let  them  inside  the  grounds.  …  I  suppose  they  were  the  reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">you fell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst</p>
<p class="calibre1">from him before he could stop himself. “<i class="calibre3">Why</i>? Why do they affect me like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that? Am I just — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  has  nothing  to  do  with  weakness,”  said  Professor  Lupin  sharply,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though he had read Harry’s mind. “The dementors affect you worse than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others because there are horrors in your past that the others don’t have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating Lupin’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">gray hairs and the lines on his young face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dementors  are  among  the  foulest  creatures  that  walk  this  earth.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">infest  the  darkest,  filthiest  places,  they  glory  in  decay  and  despair,  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel their presence, though they can’t see them. Get too near a dementor and</p>
<p class="calibre1">every  good  feeling,  every  happy  memory  will  be  sucked  out  of  you.  If  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something</p>
<p class="calibre1">like  itself  …  soul-less  and  evil.  You’ll  be  left  with  nothing  but  the  worst</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiences  of  your  life.  And  the  worst  that  happened  to   <i class="calibre3">you, </i>  Harry,  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough  to  make  anyone  fall  off  their  broom.  You  have  nothing  to  feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">ashamed of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When  they  get  near  me  —”  Harry  stared  at  Lupin’s  desk,  his  throat</p>
<p class="calibre1">tight. “I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  made  a  sudden  motion  with  his  arm  as  though  to  grip  Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment’s silence, then —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did they have to come to the match?” said Harry bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re getting hungry,” said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">snap. “Dumbledore won’t let them into the school, so their supply of human</p>
<p class="calibre1">prey has dried up. … I don’t think they could resist the large crowd around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Quidditch field. All that excitement … emotions running high … it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">their idea of a feast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Azkaban must be terrible,” Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don’t need</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they’re all trapped inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  own  heads,  incapable  of  a  single  cheerful  thought.  Most  of  them  go</p>
<p class="calibre1">mad within weeks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Sirius Black escaped from them,” Harry said slowly. “He got away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>Lupin’s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he said, straightening up, “Black must have found a way to fight</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. I wouldn’t have believed it possible. … Dementors are supposed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">You</i> made that dementor on the train back off,” said Harry suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are — certain defenses one can use,” said Lupin. “But there was</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  one  dementor  on  the  train.  The  more  there  are,  the  more  difficult  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">becomes to resist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What defenses?” said Harry at once. “Can you teach me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry … quite the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrary. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to fight them —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin looked into Harry’s determined face, hesitated, then said, “Well …</p>
<p class="calibre1">all right. I’ll try and help. But it’ll have to wait until next term, I’m afraid. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient time to fall</p>
<p class="calibre1">ill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he might never have to hear his mother’s death again, and the fact that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ravenclaw  flattened  Hufflepuff  in  their  Quidditch  match  at  the  end  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">November, Harry’s mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood  became  repossessed  of  his  manic  energy,  and  worked  his  team  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore’s anger seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two  weeks  before  the  end  of  the  term,  the  sky  lightened  suddenly  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had already decorated his</p>
<p class="calibre1">classroom  with  shimmering  lights  that  turned  out  to  be  real,  fluttering</p>
<p class="calibre1">fairies. The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  Ron  and  Hermione  had  decided  to  remain  at  Hogwarts,  and  though</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  said  it  was  because  he  couldn’t  stand  two  weeks  with  Percy,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn’t fooled; they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be another Hogsmeade</p>
<p class="calibre1">trip on the very last weekend of the term. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  can  do  all  our  Christmas  shopping  there!”  said  Hermione.  “Mum</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Dad  would  really  love  those  Toothflossing  Stringmints  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Honeydukes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,  Harry  borrowed  a  copy  of   <i class="calibre3">Which  Broomstick</i>  from  Wood,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided  to  spend  the  day  reading  up  on  the  different  makes.  He  had  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  was  very  slow  and  jerky;  he  definitely  needed  a  new  broom  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">up  the  marble  staircase  alone,  and  headed  back  toward  Gryffindor  Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snow had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still</p>
<p class="calibre1">and quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Psst — Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and George</p>
<p class="calibre1">peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  are  you  doing?”  said  Harry  curiously.  “How  come  you’re  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to Hogsmeade?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,” said Fred, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with a mysterious wink. “Come in here. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then turned, beaming, to look at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Early Christmas present for you, Harry,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on</p>
<p class="calibre1">one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing  written  on  it.  Harry,  suspecting  one  of  Fred  and  George’s  jokes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stared at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that supposed to be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This,  Harry,  is  the  secret  of  our  success,”  said  George,  patting  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">parchment fondly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>“It’s  a  wrench,  giving  it  to  you,”  said  Fred,  “but  we  decided  last  night, </p>
<p class="calibre1">your need’s greater than ours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, we know it by heart,” said George. “We bequeath it to you. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t really need it anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though Harry had mortally offended him. “Explain, George.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well … when we were in our first year, Harry — young, carefree, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">innocent —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  snorted.  He  doubted  whether  Fred  and  George  had  ever  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">innocent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— well, more innocent than we are now — we got into a spot of bother</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Filch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— detention —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— disembowelment —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets</p>
<p class="calibre1">marked  <i class="calibre3">Confiscated and Highly Dangerous. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t tell me —” said Harry, starting to grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred. “George caused a diversion</p>
<p class="calibre1">by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">—  <i class="calibre3">this. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know,” said George. “We don’t reckon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch  ever  found  out  how  to  work  it.  He  probably  suspected  what  it  was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though, or he wouldn’t have confiscated it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you know how to work it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Fred, smirking. “This little beauty’s taught us more than</p>
<p class="calibre1">all the teachers in this school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re  winding  me  up,”  said  Harry,  looking  at  the  ragged  old  bit  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, are we?” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  took  out  his  wand,  touched  the  parchment  lightly,  and  said,  “<i class="calibre3">I</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">solemnly swear that I am up to no good. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a><img src="index-142_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider’s web from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">point  that  George’s  wand  had  touched.  They  joined  each  other,  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">crisscrossed,  they  fanned  into  every  corner  of  the  parchment;  then  words</p>
<p class="calibre1">began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each</p>
<p class="calibre1">labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">labeled  dot  in  the  top  left  corner  showed  that  Professor  Dumbledore  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy</p>
<p class="calibre1">room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed something else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them seemed to lead —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four” — he pointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">them  out  —  “but  we’re  sure  we’re  the  only  ones  who  know  about   <i class="calibre3">these. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it</p>
<p class="calibre1">until  last  winter,  but  it’s  caved  in  —  completely  blocked.  And  we  don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">reckon  anyone’s  ever  used  this  one,  because  the  Whomping  Willow’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cellar  of  Honeydukes.  We’ve  used  it  loads  of  times.  And  as  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">might’ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyed old crone’s hump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moony,  Wormtail,  Padfoot,  and  Prongs,”  sighed  George,  patting  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heading of the map. “We owe them so much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Noble  men,  working  tirelessly  to  help  a  new  generation  of  law-</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakers,” said Fred solemnly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said George briskly. “Don’t forget to wipe it after you’ve used it</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— or anyone can read it,” Fred said warningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>“Just tap it again and say, ‘Mischief managed!’ And it’ll go blank.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,  young  Harry,”  said  Fred,  in  an  uncanny  impersonation  of  Percy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“mind you behave yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you in Honeydukes,” said George, winking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch</p>
<p class="calibre1">really didn’t know … he wouldn’t have to pass the dementors at all. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  even  as  he  stood  there,  flooded  with  excitement,  something  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Never  trust  anything  that  can  think  for  itself,  if  you  can’t  see  where  it</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">keeps its brain. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  warning  against.  …   <i class="calibre3">Aids  for  Magical  Mischief-Makers</i>  …  but  then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn’t as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though  he  wanted  to  steal  anything  or  attack  anyone  …  and  Fred  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stuffed  it  inside  his  robes,  and  hurried  to  the  door  of  the  classroom.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  did  he  have  to  do?  He  pulled  out  the  map  again  and  saw,  to  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">astonishment,  that  a  new  ink  figure  had  appeared  upon  it,  labeled   <i class="calibre3">Harry</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Potter. </i> This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  halfway  down  the  third-floor  corridor.  Harry  watched  carefully.  His</p>
<p class="calibre1">little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure. The word inside said, “<i class="calibre3">Dissendium. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Dissendium</i>!” Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  once,  the  statue’s  hump  opened  wide  enough  to  admit  a  fairly  thin</p>
<p class="calibre1">person.  Harry  glanced  quickly  up  and  down  the  corridor,  then  tucked  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  cold,  damp  earth.  He  stood  up,  looking  around.  It  was  pitch  dark.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>held up his wand, muttered, “<i class="calibre3">Lumos</i>!” and saw that he was in a very narrow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">low,  earthy  passageway.  He  raised  the  map,  tapped  it  with  the  tip  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand, and muttered, “Mischief managed!” The map went blank at once. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both</p>
<p class="calibre1">excited and apprehensive, he set off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  passage  twisted  and  turned,  more  like  the  burrow  of  a  giant  rabbit</p>
<p class="calibre1">than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  took  ages,  but  Harry  had  the  thought  of  Honeydukes  to  sustain  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped</p>
<p class="calibre1">up, his face hot, his feet very cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to</p>
<p class="calibre1">climb.  A  hundred  steps,  two  hundred  steps,  he  lost  count  as  he  climbed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">watching his feet. … Then, without warning, his head hit something hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  to  be  a  trapdoor.  Harry  stood  there,  massaging  the  top  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head,  listening.  He  couldn’t  hear  any  sounds  above  him.  Very  slowly,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  in  a  cellar,  which  was  full  of  wooden  crates  and  boxes.  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it — it blended so perfectly with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry crept slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could definitely hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wondering  what  he  ought  to  do,  he  suddenly  heard  a  door  open  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they’ve nearly cleaned us out</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” said a woman’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  pair  of  feet  was  coming  down  the  staircase.  Harry  leapt  behind  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous  crate  and  waited  for  the  footsteps  to  pass.  He  heard  the  man</p>
<p class="calibre1">shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get another chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly  and  silently,  Harry  dodged  out  from  his  hiding  place  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbed  the  stairs;  looking  back,  he  saw  an  enormous  backside  and  shiny</p>
<p class="calibre1">bald head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes —</p>
<p class="calibre1">he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">twice  at  Harry.  He  edged  among  them,  looking  around,  and  suppressed  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley’s piggy face if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he could see where Harry was now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  shelves  upon  shelves  of  the  most  succulent-looking  sweets</p>
<p class="calibre1">imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut</p>
<p class="calibre1">ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in</p>
<p class="calibre1">neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fizzing  Whizbees,  the  levitating  sherbert  balls  that  Ron  had  mentioned; </p>
<p class="calibre1">along  yet  another  wall  were  “Special  Effects”  sweets:  Drooble’s  Best</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blowing  Gum  (which  filled  a  room  with  bluebell-colored  bubbles  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">refused  to  pop  for  days),  the  strange,  splintery  Toothflossing  Stringmints, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny  black  Pepper  Imps  (“breathe  fire  for  your  friends!”),  Ice  Mice  (“hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  teeth  chatter  and  squeak!”),  peppermint  creams  shaped  like  toads</p>
<p class="calibre1">(“hop  realistically  in  the  stomach!”),  fragile  sugar-spun  quills,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploding bonbons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  squeezed  himself  through  a  crowd  of  sixth  years  and  saw  a  sign</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored</p>
<p class="calibre1">lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ugh, no, Harry won’t want one of those, they’re for vampires, I expect,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How about these?” said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely not,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron nearly dropped the jar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Harry</i>!”  squealed  Hermione.  “What  are  you  doing  here?  How  —  how</p>
<p class="calibre1">did you — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow!”  said  Ron,  looking  very  impressed,  “you’ve  learned  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparate!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Course I haven’t,” said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder’s Map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How come Fred and George never gave it to  <i class="calibre3">me</i>!” said Ron, outraged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m their brother!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  Harry  isn’t  going  to  keep  it!”  said  Hermione,  as  though  the  idea</p>
<p class="calibre1">were ludicrous. “He’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a><img src="index-146_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m not!” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are  you  mad?”  said  Ron,  goggling  at  Hermione.  “Hand  in  something</p>
<p class="calibre1">that good?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and</p>
<p class="calibre1">George had nicked it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He could be using one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  can’t  be  getting  in  through  a  passage,”  said  Harry  quickly.  “There</p>
<p class="calibre1">are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch</p>
<p class="calibre1">already knows about four of them. And of the other three — one of them’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">caved  in,  so  no  one  can  get  through  it.  One  of  them’s  got  the  Whomping</p>
<p class="calibre1">Willow planted over the entrance, so you can’t get out of it. And the one I</p>
<p class="calibre1">just came through — well — it’s really hard to see the entrance to it down</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  hesitated.  What  if  Black  did  know  the  passage  was  there?  Ron, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the inside of the sweetshop door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Customers  are  reminded  that  until  further  notice, </i>  <i class="calibre3">dementors  will  be</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">patrolling  the  streets  of  Hogsmeade  every  night  after  sundown.  This</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">measure  has  been  put  in  place  for  the  safety  of  Hogsmeade  residents  and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">will  be  lifted  upon  the  recapture  of  Sirius  Black.  It  is  therefore  advisable</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">that you complete your shopping well before nightfall. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Merry Christmas! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“See?”  said  Ron  quietly.  “I’d  like  to  see  Black  try  and  break  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Honeydukes  with  dementors  swarming  all  over  the  village.  Anyway, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn’t they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They live over the shop!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but — but —” Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem.  “Look,  Harry  still  shouldn’t  be  coming  into  Hogsmeade.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">hasn’t got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he’ll be in so much trouble! </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it’s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns up today? Now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>“He’d have a job spotting Harry in this,” said Ron, nodding through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. “Come on, Hermione, it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas. Harry deserves a break.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you going to report me?” Harry asked her, grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh — of course not — but honestly, Harry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seen  the  Fizzing  Whizbees,  Harry?”  said  Ron,  grabbing  him  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading him over to their barrel. “And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole right through</p>
<p class="calibre1">my  tongue.  I  remember  Mum  walloping  him  with  her  broomstick.”  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">stared  broodingly  into  the  Acid  Pop  box.  “Reckon  Fred’d  take  a  bit  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  shivered;  unlike  the  other  two,  he  didn’t  have  his  cloak.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">headed  up  the  street,  heads  bowed  against  the  wind,  Ron  and  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouting through their scarves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s the post office —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Zonko’s is up there —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We could go up to the Shrieking Shack —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell  you  what,”  said  Ron,  his  teeth  chattering,  “shall  we  go  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  more  than  willing;  the  wind  was  fierce  and  his  hands  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny inn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  extremely  crowded,  noisy,  warm,  and  smoky.  A  curvy  sort  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s  Madam  Rosmerta,”  said  Ron.  “I’ll  get  the  drinks,  shall  I?”  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">added, going slightly red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, where there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>“Merry Christmas!” he said happily, raising his tankard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he’d ever tasted and</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professors  McGonagall  and  Flitwick  had  just  entered  the  pub  with  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">flurry  of  snowflakes,  shortly  followed  by  Hagrid,  who  was  deep  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  an  instant,  Ron  and  Hermione  had  both  placed  hands  on  the  top  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Dripping with</p>
<p class="calibre1">butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his empty tankard and</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched  the  teachers’  and  Fudge’s  feet  move  toward  the  bar,  pause,  then</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn and walk right toward him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, “<i class="calibre3">Mobiliarbus</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Christmas  tree  beside  their  table  rose  a  few  inches  off  the  ground, </p>
<p class="calibre1">drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hiding  them  from  view.  Staring  through  the  dense  lower  branches,  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and heard a woman’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A small gillywater —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mine,” said Professor McGonagall’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Four pints of mulled mead —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ta, Rosmerta,” said Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmm!” said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you’ll be the red currant rum, Minister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Rosmerta, m’dear,” said Fudge’s voice. “Lovely to see you</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, I must say. Have one yourself, won’t you? Come and join us. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, thank you very much, Minister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn’t it occurred to him</p>
<p class="calibre1">that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too? And how long</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  they  going  to  sit  there?  He  needed  time  to  sneak  back  into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>Honeydukes  if  he  wanted  to  return  to  school  tonight.  …  Hermione’s  leg</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave a nervous twitch next to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?” came Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rosmerta’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  saw  the  lower  part  of  Fudge’s  thick  body  twist  in  his  chair  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What else, m’dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">up at the school at Halloween?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I did hear a rumor,” admitted Madam Rosmerta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did  you  tell  the  whole  pub,  Hagrid?”  said  Professor  McGonagall</p>
<p class="calibre1">exasperatedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do  you  think  Black’s  still  in  the  area,  Minister?”  whispered  Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rosmerta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sure of it,” said Fudge shortly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice. “Scared all my customers</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. … It’s very bad for business, Minister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rosmerta, m’dear, I don’t like them any more than you do,” said Fudge</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortably. “Necessary precaution … unfortunate, but there you are. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve  just  met  some  of  them.  They’re  in  a  fury  against  Dumbledore  —  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">won’t let them inside the castle grounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  should  think  not,”  said  Professor  McGonagall  sharply.  “How  are  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hear, hear!” squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling</p>
<p class="calibre1">a foot from the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to protect you all from</p>
<p class="calibre1">something much worse. … We all know what Black’s capable of. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,” said Madam Rosmerta</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughtfully.  “Of  all  the  people  to  go  over  to  the  Dark  Side,  Sirius  Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  the  last  I’d  have  thought  …  I  mean,  I  remember  him  when  he  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy at Hogwarts. If you’d told me then what he was going to become, I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">have said you’d had too much mead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  don’t  know  the  half  of  it,  Rosmerta,”  said  Fudge  gruffly.  “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">worst he did isn’t widely known.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  worst?”  said  Madam  Rosmerta,  her  voice  alive  with  curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I certainly do,” said Fudge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>“I can’t believe that. What could possibly be worse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  say  you  remember  him  at  Hogwarts,  Rosmerta,”  murmured</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one</p>
<p class="calibre1">without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely,”  said  Professor  McGonagall.  “Black  and  Potter.  Ringleaders</p>
<p class="calibre1">of their little gang. Both very bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact — but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a</p>
<p class="calibre1">run fer their money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d  have  thought  Black  and  Potter  were  brothers!”  chimed  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Flitwick. “Inseparable!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his</p>
<p class="calibre1">other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man</p>
<p class="calibre1">when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because  Black  turned  out  to  be  in  league  with  You-Know-Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered Madam Rosmerta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Worse  even  than  that,  m’dear.  …”  Fudge  dropped  his  voice  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeded  in  a  sort  of  low  rumble.  “Not  many  people  are  aware  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potters  knew  You-Know-Who  was  after  them.  Dumbledore,  who  was  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful</p>
<p class="calibre1">spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the Fidelius Charm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How does that work?” said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Flitwick cleared his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An  immensely  complex  spell,”  he  said  squeakily,  “involving  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">magical  concealment  of  a  secret  inside  a  single,  living  soul.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  is  hidden  inside  the  chosen  person,  or  Secret-Keeper,  and  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">henceforth  impossible  to  find  —  unless,  of  course,  the  Secret-Keeper</p>
<p class="calibre1">chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting room window!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So  Black  was  the  Potters’  Secret-Keeper?”  whispered  Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rosmerta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “James Potter told Dumbledore</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Black  would  die  rather  than  tell  where  they  were,  that  Black  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">planning  to  go  into  hiding  himself  …  and  yet,  Dumbledore  remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters’ Secret-Keeper himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He suspected Black?” gasped Madam Rosmerta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Know-Who  informed  of  their  movements,”  said  Professor  McGonagall</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkly. “Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side</p>
<p class="calibre1">had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But James Potter insisted on using Black?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week after the Fidelius</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charm had been performed —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black betrayed them?” breathed Madam Rosmerta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to</p>
<p class="calibre1">declare  his  support  openly  for  You-Know-Who,  and  he  seems  to  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">planned this for the moment of the Potters’ death. But, as we all know, You-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Know-Who  met  his  downfall  in  little  Harry  Potter.  Powers  gone,  horribly</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His</p>
<p class="calibre1">master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true</p>
<p class="calibre1">colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Filthy, stinkin’ turncoat!” Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh!” said Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I met him!” growled Hagrid. “I musta bin the last ter see him before he</p>
<p class="calibre1">killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an’ James’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">house after they was killed! Jus’ got him outta the ruins, poor little thing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  great  slash  across  his  forehead,  an’  his  parents  dead  …  an’  Sirius</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black turns up, on that flyin’ motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter</p>
<p class="calibre1">me what he was doin’ there. I didn’ know he’d bin Lily an’ James’s Secret-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Keeper. Thought he’d jus’ heard the news o’ You-Know-Who’s attack an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">come ter see what he could do. White an’ shakin’, he was. An’ yeh know</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  I  did?  I  COMFORTED  THE  MURDERIN’  TRAITOR!”  Hagrid</p>
<p class="calibre1">roared. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>“Hagrid, please!” said Professor McGonagall. “Keep your voice down!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How was I ter know he wasn’ upset abou’ Lily an’ James? It was You-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Know-Who he cared abou’! An’ then he says, ‘Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m his godfather, I’ll look after him —’ Ha! But I’d had me orders from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore, an’ I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his</p>
<p class="calibre1">aunt an’ uncle’s. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told me ter take</p>
<p class="calibre1">his motorbike ter get Harry there. ‘I won’t need it anymore,’ he says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shoulda known there was somethin’ fishy goin’ on then. He loved that</p>
<p class="calibre1">motorbike,  what  was  he  givin’  it  ter  me  for?  Why  wouldn’  he  need  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore?  Fact  was,  it  was  too  easy  ter  trace.  Dumbledore  knew  he’d  bin</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Potters’ Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin’ ter have ter run fer it</p>
<p class="calibre1">that night, knew it was a matter o’ hours before the Ministry was after him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">But what if I’d given Harry to him, eh</i>? I bet he’d’ve pitched him off the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bike  halfway  out  ter  sea.  His  bes’  friends’  son!  But  when  a  wizard  goes</p>
<p class="calibre1">over  ter  the  Dark  Side,  there’s  nothin’  and  no  one  that  matters  to  ’em</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A long silence followed Hagrid’s story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with</p>
<p class="calibre1">some satisfaction, “But he didn’t manage to disappear, did he? The Ministry</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Magic caught up with him next day!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alas,  if  only  we  had,”  said  Fudge  bitterly.  “It  was  not  we  who  found</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.  It  was  little  Peter  Pettigrew  —  another  of  the  Potters’  friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pettigrew  …  that  fat  little  boy  who  was  always  tagging  around  after</p>
<p class="calibre1">them at Hogwarts?” said Madam Rosmerta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hero-worshipped Black and Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “Never</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather sharp with him. You can</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine how I — how I regret that now. …” She sounded as though she had</p>
<p class="calibre1">a sudden head cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,  now,  Minerva,”  said  Fudge  kindly,  “Pettigrew  died  a  hero’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">death. Eyewitnesses — Muggles, of course, we wiped their memories later</p>
<p class="calibre1">— told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing, ‘Lily</p>
<p class="calibre1">and James, Sirius! How could you?’ And then he went for his wand. Well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  McGonagall  blew  her  nose  and  said  thickly,  “Stupid  boy  …</p>
<p class="calibre1">foolish boy … he was always hopeless at dueling … should have left it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Ministry. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>“I tell yeh, if I’d got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I wouldn’t’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">messed  around  with  wands  —  I’d’ve  ripped  him  limb  —  from  —  limb,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t know what you’re talking about, Hagrid,” said Fudge sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nobody  but  trained  Hit  Wizards  from  the  Magical  Law  Enforcement</p>
<p class="calibre1">Squad  would  have  stood  a  chance  against  Black  once  he  was  cornered.  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  I  was  one  of  the  first  on  the  scene  after  Black  murdered  all  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">people. I — I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A crater</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer below. Bodies</p>
<p class="calibre1">everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was left of Pettigrew in front of him … a heap of bloodstained robes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and a few — a few fragments —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge’s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being</p>
<p class="calibre1">blown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  there  you  have  it,  Rosmerta,”  said  Fudge  thickly.  “Black  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken  away  by  twenty  members  of  the  Magical  Law  Enforcement  Squad</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think was</p>
<p class="calibre1">some comfort to his poor mother. Black’s been in Azkaban ever since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it true he’s mad, Minister?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly. “I certainly believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">his master’s defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of Pettigrew and</p>
<p class="calibre1">all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man — cruel</p>
<p class="calibre1">… pointless. Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban. You know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">no sense in them … but I was shocked at how  <i class="calibre3">normal</i>  Black  seemed.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You’d have thought he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">merely  bored  —  asked  if  I’d  finished  with  my  newspaper,  cool  as  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">please,  said  he  missed  doing  the  crossword.  Yes,  I  was  astounded  at  how</p>
<p class="calibre1">little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him — and he was one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  most  heavily  guarded  in  the  place,  you  know.  Dementors  outside  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">door day and night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what do you think he’s broken out to do?” said Madam Rosmerta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good gracious, Minister, he isn’t trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan,” said Fudge evasively. “But</p>
<p class="calibre1">we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>and friendless is one thing … but give him back his most devoted servant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and I shudder to think how quickly he’ll rise again. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, Cornelius, if you’re dining with the headmaster, we’d better</p>
<p class="calibre1">head back up to the castle,” said Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">owners  once  more;  hems  of  cloaks  swung  into  sight,  and  Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rosemerta’s  glittering  heels  disappeared  behind  the  bar.  The  door  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three Broomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">teachers had disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s  and  Hermione’s  faces  appeared  under  the  table.  They  were  both</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring at him, lost for words. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a><img src="index-155_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Firebolt</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back</p>
<p class="calibre1">into  the  Honeydukes  cellar,  through  the  tunnel,  and  into  the  castle  once</p>
<p class="calibre1">more. All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  he  hardly  noticed  what  he  was  doing,  because  his  head  was  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">pounding with the conversation he had just heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why  had  nobody  ever  told  him?  Dumbledore,  Hagrid,  Mr.  Weasley, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cornelius Fudge … why hadn’t anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  and  Hermione  watched  Harry  nervously  all  through  dinner,  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">daring to talk about what they’d overheard, because Percy was sitting close</p>
<p class="calibre1">by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it was to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end-of-</p>
<p class="calibre1">term  high  spirits.  Harry,  who  didn’t  want  Fred  and  George  asking  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether he’d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to the empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books</p>
<p class="calibre1">aside and quickly found what he was looking for — the leather-bound photo</p>
<p class="calibre1">album  Hagrid  had  given  him  two  years  ago,  which  was  full  of  wizard</p>
<p class="calibre1">pictures  of  his  mother  and  father.  He  sat  down  on  his  bed,  drew  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hangings around him, and started turning the pages, searching, until …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day. There was his father</p>
<p class="calibre1">waving  up  at  him,  beaming,  the  untidy  black  hair  Harry  had  inherited</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">arm in arm with his dad. And there … that must be him. Their best man …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never given him a thought before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he hadn’t known it was the same person, he would never have guessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">handsome,  full  of  laughter.  Had  he  already  been  working  for  Voldemort</p>
<p class="calibre1">when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">two  people  next  to  him?  Did  he  realize  he  was  facing  twelve  years  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Azkaban, twelve years that would make him unrecognizable? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">But  the  dementors  don’t  affect  him, </i>  Harry  thought,  staring  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">handsome,  laughing  face.  <i class="calibre3">He  doesn’t  have  to  hear  my  mum  screaming  if</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">they get too close</i> —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabinet,  took  off  his  robe  and  glasses  and  got  into  bed,  making  sure  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hangings were hiding him from view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dormitory door opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” said Ron’s voice uncertainly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Harry  lay  still,  pretending  to  be  asleep.  He  heard  Ron  leave  again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">like  poison.  He  could  see  Black  laughing  at  him  through  the  darkness,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">blasting  Peter  Pettigrew  (who  resembled  Neville  Longbottom)  into  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand pieces. He could hear (though having no idea what Black’s voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">might sound like) a low, excited mutter. “It has happened, My Lord … the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potters  have  made  me  their  Secret-Keeper.  …”  And  then  came  another</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice,  laughing  shrilly,  the  same  laugh  that  Harry  heard  inside  his  head</p>
<p class="calibre1">whenever the dementors drew near. …</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you — you look terrible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hadn’t gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to find the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dormitory  deserted,  dressed,  and  gone  down  the  spiral  staircase  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">common room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>Peppermint  Toad  and  massaging  his  stomach,  and  Hermione,  who  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">spread her homework over three tables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is everyone?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone! It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?” said Ron, watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry closely. “It’s nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ginger rug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  really  don’t  look  well,  you  know,”  Hermione  said,  peering</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxiously into his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m fine,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, listen,” said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, “you must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">go doing anything stupid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like what?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like trying to go after Black,” said Ron sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">asleep. He didn’t say anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You won’t, will you, Harry?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because Black’s not worth dying for,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at them. They didn’t seem to understand at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you  know  what  I  see  and  hear  every  time  a  dementor  gets  too  near</p>
<p class="calibre1">me?”  Ron  and  Hermione  shook  their  heads,  looking  apprehensive.  “I  can</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you’d heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  nothing  you  can  do!”  said  Hermione,  looking  stricken.  “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors will catch Black and he’ll go back to Azkaban and — and serve</p>
<p class="calibre1">him right!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t affected by Azkaban like normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">people are. It’s not a punishment for him like it is for the others.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what are you saying?” said Ron, looking very tense. “You want to —</p>
<p class="calibre1">to kill Black or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione in a panicky voice. “Harry doesn’t want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to kill anyone, do you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>Again, Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t know what he wanted to do. All he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew  was  that  the  idea  of  doing  nothing,  while  Black  was  at  liberty,  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost more than he could stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malfoy  knows,”  he  said  abruptly.  “Remember  what  he  said  to  me  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potions? ‘If it was me, I’d hunt him down myself. … I’d want revenge.’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re  going  to  take  Malfoy’s  advice  instead  of  ours?”  said  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">furiously.  “Listen  …  you  know  what  Pettigrew’s  mother  got  back  after</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  had  finished  with  him?  Dad  told  me  —  the  Order  of  Merlin,  First</p>
<p class="calibre1">Class, and Pettigrew’s finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him they</p>
<p class="calibre1">could find. Black’s a madman, Harry, and he’s dangerous —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malfoy’s dad must have told him,” said Harry, ignoring Ron. “He was</p>
<p class="calibre1">right in Voldemort’s inner circle —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Say You-Know-Who, will you</i>?” interjected Ron angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—  so  obviously,  the  Malfoys  knew  Black  was  working  for  Voldemort</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy’s just hoping you’ll get yourself killed before</p>
<p class="calibre1">he has to play you at Quidditch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  <i class="calibre3">please, </i>” said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, “<i class="calibre3">please</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don’t put yourself in</p>
<p class="calibre1">danger,  it’s  what  Black  wants.  …  Oh,  Harry,  you’d  be  playing  right  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s  hands  if  you  went  looking  for  him.  Your  mum  and  dad  wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">want you to get hurt, would they? They’d never want you to go looking for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because thanks to Black, I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">never spoken to them,” said Harry shortly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously, flexing</p>
<p class="calibre1">his claws. Ron’s pocket quivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,” said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject, “it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the holidays! It’s nearly Christmas! Let’s — let’s go down and see Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We haven’t visited him for ages!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Hermione quickly. “Harry isn’t supposed to leave the castle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, let’s go,” said Harry, sitting up, “and I can ask him how come he</p>
<p class="calibre1">never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further  discussion  of  Sirius  Black  plainly  wasn’t  what  Ron  had  had  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>“Or  we  could  have  a  game  of  chess,”  he  said  hastily,  “or  Gobstones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy left a set —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, let’s visit Hagrid,” said Harry firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  they  got  their  cloaks  from  their  dormitories  and  set  off  through  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">portrait  hole  (“Stand  and  fight,  you  yellow-bellied  mongrels!”),  down</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  glittering,  powdery  snow,  their  socks  and  the  hems  of  their  cloaks</p>
<p class="calibre1">soaked  and  freezing.  The  Forbidden  Forest  looked  as  though  it  had  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid’s cabin looked like</p>
<p class="calibre1">an iced cake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron knocked, but there was no answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s not out, is he?” said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron had his ear to the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a weird noise,” he said. “Listen — is that Fang?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin</p>
<p class="calibre1">came a series of low, throbbing moans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door. “Hagrid, are you in there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  sound  of  heavy  footsteps,  then  the  door  creaked  open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the</p>
<p class="calibre1">front of his leather vest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh’ve heard?” he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry’s neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid  being  at  least  twice  the  size  of  a  normal  man,  this  was  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughing  matter.  Harry,  about  to  collapse  under  Hagrid’s  weight,  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair  and  slumped  over  the  table,  sobbing  uncontrollably,  his  face  glazed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid, what  <i class="calibre3">is</i> it?” said Hermione, aghast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s this, Hagrid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s  sobs  redoubled,  but  he  shoved  the  letter  toward  Harry,  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked it up and read aloud:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear Mr. Hagrid, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a> <i class="calibre3">Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  that’s  okay  then,  Hagrid!”  said  Ron,  clapping  Hagrid  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, </p>
<p class="calibre1">inviting Harry to read on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">this  matter  will  therefore  be  taken  to  the  Committee  for  the  Disposal  of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dangerous  Creatures.  The  hearing  will  take  place  on  April  20th,  and  we</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the Committee</i>’ <i class="calibre3">s offices in</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">London on that date. In the meantime, the hippogriff should be kept tethered</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">and isolated. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yours in fellowship …</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">There followed a list of the school governors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">bet he’ll get off—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh  don’  know  them  gargoyles  at  the  Committee  fer  the  Disposal  o’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dangerous  Creatures!”  choked  Hagrid,  wiping  his  eyes  on  his  sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid’s cabin made Harry, Ron, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  whip  around.  Buckbeak  the  hippogriff  was  lying  in  the  corner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All</p>
<p class="calibre1">on his own! At Christmas.” </p>
