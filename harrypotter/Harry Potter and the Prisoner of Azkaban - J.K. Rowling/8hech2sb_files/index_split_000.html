<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Owl Post</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  nearly  midnight,  and  he  was  lying  on  his  stomach  in  bed,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">large  leather-bound  book   <i class="calibre3">(A  History  of  Magic</i>  by  Bathilda  Bagshot)</p>
<p class="calibre1">propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather</p>
<p class="calibre1">quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help</p>
<p class="calibre1">him  write  his  essay,  “Witch  Burning  in  the  Fourteenth  Century  Was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Completely Pointless — discuss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the book, and read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Non-magic  people  (more  commonly  known  as  Muggles)  were  particularly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">effect  whatsoever.  The  witch  or  wizard  would  perform  a  basic  Flame</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a> <i class="calibre3">Freezing  Charm  and  then  pretend  to  shriek  with  pain  while  enjoying  a</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">in various disguises. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  his  ink  bottle  and  a  roll  of  parchment.  Slowly  and  very  carefully  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">unscrewed  the  ink  bottle,  dipped  his  quill  into  it,  and  began  to  write, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Dursley  family  of  number  four,  Privet  Drive,  was  the  reason  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">their son, Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Dursleys’  roof.  For  years,  Aunt  Petunia  and  Uncle  Vernon  had  hoped</p>
<p class="calibre1">that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">squash  the  magic  out  of  him.  To  their  fury,  they  had  been  unsuccessful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent</p>
<p class="calibre1">most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  most  they  could  do,  however,  was  to  lock  away  Harry’s  spellbooks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid</p>
<p class="calibre1">him to talk to the neighbors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  essays,  a  particularly  nasty  one  about  shrinking  potions,  was  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  an  excuse  to  give  Harry  detention  for  a  month.  Harry  had  therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">seized  his  chance  in  the  first  week  of  the  holidays.  While  Uncle  Vernon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aunt  Petunia,  and  Dudley  had  gone  out  into  the  front  garden  to  admire</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the street would notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  cupboard  under  the  stairs,  grabbed  some  of  his  books,  and  hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">them in his bedroom. As long as he didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">because he’d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the school vacation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  Weasley,  who  was  one  of  Harry’s  best  friends  at  Hogwarts,  came</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  a  whole  family  of  wizards.  This  meant  that  he  knew  a  lot  of  things</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily it had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Vernon Dursley speaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  who  happened  to  be  in  the  room  at  the  time,  froze  as  he  heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s voice answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HELLO?  HELLO?  CAN  YOU  HEAR  ME?  I  —  WANT  —  TO  —</p>
<p class="calibre1">TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  was  yelling  so  loudly  that  Uncle  Vernon  jumped  and  held  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled</p>
<p class="calibre1">fury and alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. “WHO</p>
<p class="calibre1">ARE YOU?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“RON  —  WEASLEY!”  Ron  bellowed  back,  as  though  he  and  Uncle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. “I’M — A —</p>
<p class="calibre1">FRIEND — OF — HARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared, now holding the</p>
<p class="calibre1">receiver at arm’s length, as though frightened it might explode. “I DON’T</p>
<p class="calibre1">KNOW  WHAT  SCHOOL  YOU’RE  TALKING  ABOUT!  NEVER</p>
<p class="calibre1">CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON’T YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  he  threw  the  receiver  back  onto  the  telephone  as  if  dropping  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">poisonous spider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HOW  DARE  YOU  GIVE  THIS  NUMBER  TO  PEOPLE  LIKE  —</p>
<p class="calibre1">PEOPLE LIKE  <i class="calibre3">YOU</i>!” Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  obviously  realized  that  he’d  gotten  Harry  into  trouble,  because  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn’t  called  again.  Harry’s  other  best  friend  from  Hogwarts,  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  not  to  call,  which  was  a  pity,  because  Hermione,  the  cleverest</p>
<p class="calibre1">witch in Harry’s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she</p>
<p class="calibre1">went to Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  just  one  very  small  improvement  —  after  swearing  that  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t  use  her  to  send  letters  to  any  of  his  friends,  Harry  had  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed  to  let  his  owl,  Hedwig,  out  at  night.  Uncle  Vernon  had  given  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">because  of  the  racket  Hedwig  made  if  she  was  locked  in  her  cage  all  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  finished  writing  about  Wendelin  the  Weird  and  paused  to  listen</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.  The  silence  in  the  dark  house  was  broken  only  by  the  distant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley.  <i class="calibre3">It must be very late, </i> Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he’d finish this essay</p>
<p class="calibre1">tomorrow night. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from under</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  bed;  put  the  flashlight,  <i class="calibre3">A  History  of  Magic, </i>  his  essay,  quill,  and  ink</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed.  Then  he  stood  up,  stretched,  and  checked  the  time  on  the  luminous</p>
<p class="calibre1">alarm clock on his bedside table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach gave a funny jolt. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  his  birthdays.  He  had  never  received  a  birthday  card  in  his  life.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dursleys  had  completely  ignored  his  last  two  birthdays,  and  he  had  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason to suppose they would remember this one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s large, empty cage, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent for two</p>
<p class="calibre1">nights  now.  Harry  wasn’t  worried  about  her:  she’d  been  gone  this  long</p>
<p class="calibre1">before. But he hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few</p>
<p class="calibre1">inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Of  all  the  unusual  things  about  Harry,  this  scar  was  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because Lily and</p>
<p class="calibre1">James  Potter  had  not  died  in  a  car  crash.  They  had  been  murdered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">murdered  by  the  most  feared  Dark  wizard  for  a  hundred  years,  Lord</p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than</p>
<p class="calibre1">a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had</p>
<p class="calibre1">rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had fled. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Harry  had  come  face-to-face  with  him  at  Hogwarts.  Remembering</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  last  meeting  as  he  stood  at  the  dark  window,  Harry  had  to  admit  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing</p>
<p class="calibre1">absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry realized what</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was seeing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a  large,  strangely  lopsided  creature,  and  it  was  flapping  in  Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a split</p>
<p class="calibre1">second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering whether to</p>
<p class="calibre1">slam  it  shut.  But  then  the  bizarre  creature  soared  over  one  of  the  street</p>
<p class="calibre1">lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  appeared  to  be  unconscious.  They  landed  with  a  soft   <i class="calibre3">flump</i>  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  bed,  and  the  middle  owl,  which  was  large  and  gray,  keeled  right</p>
<p class="calibre1">over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  recognized  the  unconscious  owl  at  once  —  his  name  was  Errol, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cords  around  Errol’s  legs,  took  off  the  parcel,  and  then  carried  Errol  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and began to gulp some water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy</p>
<p class="calibre1">female,  was  his  own  Hedwig.  She,  too,  was  carrying  a  parcel  and  looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her</p>
<p class="calibre1">beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a><img src="index-11_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">took off through the window into the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  sat  down  on  his  bed  and  grabbed  Errol’s  package,  ripped  off  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">birthday  card.  Fingers  trembling  slightly,  he  opened  the  envelope.  Two</p>
<p class="calibre1">pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a newspaper clipping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the  <i class="calibre3">Daily</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Prophet, </i>  because  the  people  in  the  black-and-white  picture  were  moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Arthur  Weasley,  Head  of  the  Misuse  of </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Muggle  Artifacts  Office  at  the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Ministry of Magic, has won the annual </i> Daily Prophet <i class="calibre3"> Grand Prize Galleon</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Draw. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A delighted Mr. Weasley told the </i> Daily Prophet <i class="calibre3">, “We will be spending the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">currently attend. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  he  saw  all  nine  of  the  Weasleys  waving  furiously  at  him,  standing  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front  of  a  large  pyramid.  Plump  little  Mrs.  Weasley;  tall,  balding  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley;  six  sons;  and  one  daughter,  all  (though  the  black-and-white</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture  didn’t  show  it)  with  flaming-red  hair.  Right  in  the  middle  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture  was  Ron,  tall  and  gangling,  with  his  pet  rat,  Scabbers,  on  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. He picked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up Ron’s letter and unfolded it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear Harry, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Happy birthday! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Look,  I’m  really  sorry  about  that  telephone  call.  I  hope  the  Muggles</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">didn’t give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn’t have</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a><img src="index-12_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">shouted. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">It’s amazing here in Egypt. Bill’s taken us around all the tombs and you</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">wouldn’t believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">wouldn’t  let  Ginny  come  in  the  last  one.  There  were  all  these  mutant</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">skeletons in there, of Muggles who’d broken in and grown extra heads and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">stuff. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I  couldn’t  believe  it  when  Dad  won  the</i>  Daily  Prophet   <i class="calibre3">Draw.  Seven</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">hundred galleons! Most of it’s gone on this trip, but they’re going to buy me</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">a new wand for next year. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron’s old wand had</p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">We’ll be back about a week before term starts and we’ll be going up to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">London  to  get  my  wand  and  our  new  books.  Any  chance  of  meeting  you</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">there? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Don’t let the Muggles get you down! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Try and come to London, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">PS. Per </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">cy’s Head Boy. </i>  <i class="calibre3">He got the letter last week. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and</p>
<p class="calibre1">final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He had pinned his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his horn-</p>
<p class="calibre1">rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  now  turned  to  his  present  and  unwrapped  it.  Inside  was  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked  like  a  miniature  glass  spinning  top.  There  was  another  note  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron beneath it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Harry</i> —  <i class="calibre3">this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s someone untrustworthy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">around,  it’s  supposed  to  light  up  and  spin.  Bill  says  it’s  rubbish  sold  for</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">wizard tourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">night. But he didn’t realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Bye</i> —</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><img src="index-13_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-13_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  put  the  Pocket  Sneakoscope  on  his  bedside  table,  where  it  stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the parcel Hedwig</p>
<p class="calibre1">had brought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, this time</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear Harry, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I do hope you’re all right. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’m  on  holiday  in  France  at  the  moment  and  I  didn’t  know  how  I  was</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">going to send this to you</i> —  <i class="calibre3">what if they’d opened it at customs? </i> —  <i class="calibre3">but</i>  <i class="calibre3">then</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Hedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there was</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">an advertisement in the</i> Daily Prophet  <i class="calibre3">(I’ve been getting it delivered; it’s so</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">good to keep up with what’s going on in the wizarding world). Did you see</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet he’s learning loads. I’m</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">really jealous</i> —  <i class="calibre3">the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">There’s  some  interesting  local  history  of  witchcraft  here,  too.  I’ve</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">rewritten  my  whole  History  of  Magic  essay  to  include  some  of  the  things</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’ve found out. I hope it’s not too long</i> —  <i class="calibre3">it’stwo rolls of parchment more</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">than Professor Binns asked for. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Ron says he’s going to be in London in the last week of the holidays. Can</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope you can. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">If not, I’ll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September first! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Love from</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">PS. Ron says Percy’s Head Boy. I’ll bet Percy’s really pleased. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Ron doesn’t seem too happy about it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  laughed  as  he  put  Hermione’s  letter  aside  and  picked  up  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">large  book  full  of  very  difficult  spells  —  but  it  wasn’t.  His  heart  gave  a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with silver words stamped across it, reading  <i class="calibre3">Broomstick Servicing Kit. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of</p>
<p class="calibre1">gleaming  silver  Tail-Twig  Clippers,  a  tiny  brass  compass  to  clip  on  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">broom for long journeys, and a  <i class="calibre3">Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  Quidditch,  the  most  popular  sport  in  the  magical  world  —  highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  picked  for  one  of  the  Hogwarts  House  teams.  One  of  Harry’s  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  put  the  leather  case  aside  and  picked  up  his  last  parcel.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognized  the  untidy  scrawl  on  the  brown  paper  at  once:  this  was  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid,  the  Hogwarts  gamekeeper.  He  tore  off  the  top  layer  of  paper  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">glimpsed  something  green  and  leathery,  but  before  he  could  unwrap  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">properly,  the  parcel  gave  a  strange  quiver,  and  whatever  was  inside  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped loudly — as though it had jaws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  froze.  He  knew  that  Hagrid  would  never  send  him  anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view</p>
<p class="calibre1">of what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, </p>
<p class="calibre1">buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon</p>
<p class="calibre1">eggs into his cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it</p>
<p class="calibre1">over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his other hand and pulled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And out fell — a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome green</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover,  emblazoned  with  the  golden  title   <i class="calibre3">The  Monster  Book  of  Monsters, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some</p>
<p class="calibre1">weird crab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-oh,” Harry muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  book  toppled  off  the  bed  with  a  loud  clunk  and  shuffled  rapidly</p>
<p class="calibre1">across  the  room.  Harry  followed  it  stealthily.  The  book  was  hiding  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a><img src="index-15_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  book  snapped  shut  on  his  hand  and  then  flapped  past  him,  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the room</p>
<p class="calibre1">next door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling</p>
<p class="calibre1">book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a</p>
<p class="calibre1">belt,  which  he  buckled  tightly  around  it.  The   <i class="calibre3">Monster  Book</i>  shuddered</p>
<p class="calibre1">angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it down on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed and reached for Hagrid’s card. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear</i>  <i class="calibre3">Harry, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Happy birthday! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Think you might find this</i>  <i class="calibre3">useful for next year. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Won’t say no more here. Tell you when I see you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Hope the Muggles are treating you right. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">All the best, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Hagrid</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  useful,  but  he  put  Hagrid’s  card  up  next  to  Ron’s  and  Hermione’s, </p>
<p class="calibre1">grinning  more  broadly  than  ever.  Now  there  was  only  the  letter  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Noticing  that  it  was  rather  thicker  than  usual,  Harry  slit  open  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear Mr. Potter, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The Hogwarts Express will leave from King’s Cross station, platform nine</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">and three-quarters, at eleven o’clock. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Third  years  are  permitted  to  visit  the  village  of  Hogsmeade  on  certain</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">weekends.  Please  give  the  enclosed  permission  form  to  your  parent  or</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">guardian to sign. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A list of books for next year is enclosed. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yours sincerely, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Deputy Headmistress</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  pulled  out  the  Hogsmeade  permission  form  and  looked  at  it,  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia</p>
<p class="calibre1">to sign the form? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  looked  over  at  the  alarm  clock.  It  was  now  two  o’clock  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d  made  for  himself,  counting  down  the  days  left  until  his  return  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing his</p>
<p class="calibre1">three birthday cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just</p>
<p class="calibre1">like  everyone  else  —  glad,  for  the  first  time  in  his  life,  that  it  was  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">birthday. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><img src="index-17_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Aunt Marge’s Big Mistake</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys</p>
<p class="calibre1">already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new</p>
<p class="calibre1">television,  a  welcome-home-for-the-summer  present  for  Dudley,  who  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  complaining  loudly  about  the  long  walk  between  the  fridge  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">as he ate continually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  sat  down  between  Dudley  and  Uncle  Vernon,  a  large,  beefy  man</p>
<p class="calibre1">with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“… The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  special  hot  line  has  been  set  up,  and  any  sighting  of  Black  should  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">reported immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No need to tell us  <i class="calibre3">he’s</i> no good,” snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">top  of  his  newspaper  at  the  prisoner.  “Look  at  the  state  of  him,  the  filthy</p>
<p class="calibre1">layabout! Look at his hair!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>He  shot  a  nasty  look  sideways  at  Harry,  whose  untidy  hair  had  always</p>
<p class="calibre1">been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  television,  however,  whose  gaunt  face  was  surrounded  by  a  matted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reporter had reappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t tell us where that maniac’s escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be coming up the street right now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aunt  Petunia,  who  was  bony  and  horse-faced,  whipped  around  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring, law-</p>
<p class="calibre1">abiding neighbors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When will they  <i class="calibre3">learn, </i>” said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">large purple fist, “that hanging’s the only way to deal with these people?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">runner beans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, “I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge’s train gets in at ten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aunt Marge?” he blurted out. “Sh —  <i class="calibre3">she’s</i> not coming here, is she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s sister. Even though she was not a blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">relative of Harry’s (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia’s sister), he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been forced to call her “Aunt” all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn’t often</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry’s mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical</p>
<p class="calibre1">statues.  A  few  years  later,  she  had  turned  up  at  Christmas  with  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her</p>
<p class="calibre1">last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally</p>
<p class="calibre1">trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>midnight.  The  memory  of  this  incident  still  brought  tears  of  laughter  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dudley’s eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “and while we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  subject”  —  he  pointed  a  fat  finger  threateningly  at  Harry  —  “we</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dudley  smirked  and  withdrew  his  gaze  from  the  television.  Watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  being  bullied  by  Uncle  Vernon  was  Dudley’s  favorite  form  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertainment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil tongue in your head</p>
<p class="calibre1">when you’re talking to Marge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s talking to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Secondly,”  said  Uncle  Vernon,  acting  as  though  he  had  not  heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know anything about your  <i class="calibre3">abnormality, </i> I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t want any — any  <i class="calibre3">funny</i>  stuff  while  she’s  here.  You  behave  yourself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">got me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  thirdly,”  said  Uncle  Vernon,  his  mean  little  eyes  now  slits  in  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">great purple face, “we’ve told Marge you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center</p>
<p class="calibre1">for Incurably Criminal Boys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What</i>?” Harry yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  you’ll  be  sticking  to  that  story,  boy,  or  there’ll  be  trouble,”  spat</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly</p>
<p class="calibre1">able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a week-long visit — it was the</p>
<p class="calibre1">worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, including that pair</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  Petunia,”  said  Uncle  Vernon,  getting  heavily  to  his  feet,  “I’ll  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”  said  Dudley,  whose  attention  had  returned  to  the  television  now</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,” said Aunt Petunia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">smoothing Dudley’s thick blond hair. “Mummy’s bought him a lovely new</p>
<p class="calibre1">bow tie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  who  had  been  sitting  in  a  kind  of  horrified  trance,  had  a  sudden</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>Vernon to the front door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not taking  <i class="calibre3">you, </i>” he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like  I  wanted  to  come,”  said  Harry  coldly.  “I  want  to  ask  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Third  years  at  Hog  —  at  my  school  are  allowed  to  visit  the  village</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry in a rush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”  said  Harry,  choosing  his  words  carefully,  “it’ll  be  hard  work, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“St.  Brutus’s  Secure  Center  for  Incurably  Criminal  Boys!”  bellowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle  Vernon,  and  Harry  was  pleased  to  hear  a  definite  note  of  panic  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,”  said  Harry,  looking  calmly  up  into  Uncle  Vernon’s  large, </p>
<p class="calibre1">purple face. “It’s a lot to remember. I’ll have to make it sound convincing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">won’t I? What if I accidentally let something slip?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">You’ll  get  the  stuffing  knocked  out  of  you,  won’t  you</i>?”  roared  Uncle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vernon,  advancing  on  Harry  with  his  fist  raised.  But  Harry  stood  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt Marge forget what I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could tell her,” he said grimly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on quickly, “I swear</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll remember where I’m supposed to go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug</p>
<p class="calibre1">— like I’m normal and everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,”  he  snapped  finally.  “I  shall  monitor  your  behavior  carefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">during Marge’s visit. If, at the end of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">story, I’ll sign your ruddy form.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>Harry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he’d better start now. Slowly and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sadly  he  gathered  up  all  his  presents  and  his  birthday  cards  and  hid  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to Hedwig’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cage.  Errol  seemed  to  have  recovered;  he  and  Hedwig  were  both  asleep, </p>
<p class="calibre1">heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hedwig,”  he  said  gloomily,  “you’re  going  to  have  to  clear  off  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">week.  Go  with  Errol.  Ron’ll  look  after  you.  I’ll  write  him  a  note, </p>
<p class="calibre1">explaining. And don’t look at me like that” — Hedwig’s large amber eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">were reproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll be allowed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her</p>
<p class="calibre1">leg)  soared  out  of  the  window  and  out  of  sight.  Harry,  now  feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Harry  didn’t  have  long  to  brood.  In  next  to  no  time,  Aunt  Petunia</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  shrieking  up  the  stairs  for  Harry  to  come  down  and  get  ready  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcome their guest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  couldn’t  see  the  point  of  trying  to  make  his  hair  lie  flat.  Aunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marge  loved  criticizing  him,  so  the  untidier  he  looked,  the  happier  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon’s car</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the garden path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  threshold  stood  Aunt  Marge.  She  was  very  like  Uncle  Vernon:</p>
<p class="calibre1">large,  beefy,  and  purple-faced,  she  even  had  a  mustache,  though  not  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s my neffy-poo?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the</p>
<p class="calibre1">suitcase into Harry’s stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized Dudley</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>Harry  knew  perfectly  well  that  Dudley  only  put  up  with  Aunt  Marge’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hugs  because  he  was  well  paid  for  it,  and  sure  enough,  when  they  broke</p>
<p class="calibre1">apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Petunia!” shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hat  stand.  Aunt  Marge  and  Aunt  Petunia  kissed,  or  rather,  Aunt  Marge</p>
<p class="calibre1">bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia’s bony cheekbone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said Aunt Marge as they</p>
<p class="calibre1">all  proceeded  into  the  kitchen,  leaving  Harry  alone  in  the  hall  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">suitcase.  But  Harry  wasn’t  complaining;  any  excuse  not  to  be  with  Aunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedroom, taking as long as he could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  time  he  got  back  to  the  kitchen,  Aunt  Marge  had  been  supplied</p>
<p class="calibre1">with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw  Aunt  Petunia  wince  slightly  as  specks  of  tea  and  drool  flecked  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s looking after the other dogs, Marge?” Uncle Vernon asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  I’ve  got  Colonel  Fubster  managing  them,”  boomed  Aunt  Marge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  retired  now,  good  for  him  to  have  something  to  do.  But  I  couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he’s away from me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ripper  began  to  growl  again  as  Harry  sat  down.  This  directed  Aunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marge’s attention to Harry for the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt Marge growled. “It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">damn  good  of  Vernon  and  Petunia  to  keep  you.  Wouldn’t  have  done  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself. You’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d been dumped on</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">my</i> doorstep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an orphanage than with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Dursleys,  but  the  thought  of  the  Hogsmeade  form  stopped  him.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">forced his face into a painful smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. “I can see you haven’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners</p>
<p class="calibre1">into  you.”  She  took  a  large  gulp  of  tea,  wiped  her  mustache,  and  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>“St.  Brutus’s,”  said  Uncle  Vernon  promptly.  “It’s  a  first-rate  institution</p>
<p class="calibre1">for hopeless cases.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  see,”  said  Aunt  Marge.  “Do  they  use  the  cane  at  St.  Brutus’s,  boy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she barked across the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he added, “all the time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” said Aunt Marge. “I won’t have this namby-pamby, wishy-</p>
<p class="calibre1">washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  what’s  needed  in  ninety-nine  cases  out  of  a  hundred.  Have   <i class="calibre3">you</i>  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten often?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, “loads of times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  still  don’t  like  your  tone,  boy,”  she  said.  “If  you  can  speak  of  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">beatings  in  that  casual  way,  they  clearly  aren’t  hitting  you  hard  enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petunia, I’d write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of</p>
<p class="calibre1">extreme force in this boy’s case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain; </p>
<p class="calibre1">in any case, he changed the subject abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As  Aunt  Marge  started  to  make  herself  at  home,  Harry  caught  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle Vernon</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their way, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  only  too  happy  to  do.  Aunt  Marge,  on  the  other  hand,  wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom out suggestions for</p>
<p class="calibre1">his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as though daring him to ask why he hadn’t got a present too. She also kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">throwing  out  dark  hints  about  what  made  Harry  such  an  unsatisfactory</p>
<p class="calibre1">person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, Vernon,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she  said  over  lunch  on  the  third  day.  “If  there’s  something  rotten  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">inside, </i> there’s nothing anyone can do about it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face</p>
<p class="calibre1">was starting to burn with anger.  <i class="calibre3">Remember the form</i>, he told himself.  <i class="calibre3">Think</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">about Hogsmeade. Don’t say anything. Don’t rise</i> —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You see it all the time</p>
<p class="calibre1">with dogs. If there’s something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong with the pup —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinked, her great ruddy face dripping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marge!” squealed Aunt Petunia. “Marge, are you all right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not to worry,” grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Aunt  Petunia  and  Uncle  Vernon  were  both  looking  at  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspiciously,  so  he  decided  he’d  better  skip  dessert  and  escape  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table as soon as he could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside  in  the  hall,  he  leaned  against  the  wall,  breathing  deeply.  It  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been a long time since he’d lost control and made something explode. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn’t the only</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  at  stake  —  if  he  carried  on  like  that,  he’d  be  in  trouble  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ministry of Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law</p>
<p class="calibre1">to do magic outside school. His record wasn’t exactly clean either. Only last</p>
<p class="calibre1">summer he’d gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face</p>
<p class="calibre1">expulsion from Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  heard  the  Dursleys  leaving  the  table  and  hurried  upstairs  out  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  <i class="calibre3">Handbook  of  Do-It-Yourself  Broomcare</i>  whenever  Aunt  Marge  started</p>
<p class="calibre1">on him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  Aunt  Marge  started  voicing  the  opinion  that  he  was  mentally</p>
<p class="calibre1">subnormal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  last,  at  long  last,  the  final  evening  of  Marge’s  stay  arrived.  Aunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single  mention  of  Harry’s  faults;  during  the  lemon  meringue  pie,  Uncle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vernon  bored  them  all  with  a  long  talk  about  Grunnings,  his  drill-making</p>
<p class="calibre1">company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle of brandy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can I tempt you, Marge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very</p>
<p class="calibre1">red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a small one, then,” she chuckled. “A bit more than that … and a bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">more … that’s the ticket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dudley  was  eating  his  fourth  slice  of  pie.  Aunt  Petunia  was  sipping</p>
<p class="calibre1">coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear</p>
<p class="calibre1">into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon’s angry little eyes and knew he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have to sit it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aah,” said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass  back  down.  “Excellent  nosh,  Petunia.  It’s  normally  just  a  fry-up  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after. …” She burped richly and</p>
<p class="calibre1">patted her great tweed stomach. “Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-</p>
<p class="calibre1">sized boy,” she went on, winking at Dudley. “You’ll be a proper-sized man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dudders, like your father. Yes, I’ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, this one here —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  jerked  her  head  at  Harry,  who  felt  his  stomach  clench.  <i class="calibre3">The</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Handbook</i>, he thought quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This one’s got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  Colonel  Fubster  drown  one  last  year.  Ratty  little  thing  it  was.  Weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Underbred.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book:  <i class="calibre3">A Charm to Cure</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Reluctant Reversers. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  all  comes  down  to  blood,  as  I  was  saying  the  other  day.  Bad  blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">will  out.  Now,  I’m  saying  nothing  against  your  family,  Petunia”  —  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">patted Aunt Petunia’s bony hand with her shovellike one — “but your sister</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then she ran off with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wastrel and here’s the result right in front of us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  staring  at  his  plate,  a  funny  ringing  in  his  ears.  <i class="calibre3">Grasp your</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">broom firmly by the tail, </i> he thought. But he couldn’t remember what came</p>
<p class="calibre1">next. Aunt Marge’s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vernon’s drills. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>“This  Potter,”  said  Aunt  Marge  loudly,  seizing  the  brandy  bottle  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, “you never told me</p>
<p class="calibre1">what he did?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle  Vernon  and  Aunt  Petunia  were  looking  extremely  tense.  Dudley</p>
<p class="calibre1">had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  —  didn’t  work,”  said  Uncle  Vernon,  with  half  a  glance  at  Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unemployed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As  I  expected!”  said  Aunt  Marge,  taking  a  huge  swig  of  brandy  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiping  her  chin  on  her  sleeve.  “A  no-account,  good-for-nothing,  lazy</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrounger who —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was not,” said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge’s glass. “You, boy,” he snarled at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go to bed, go on —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,  Vernon,”  hiccuped  Aunt  Marge,  holding  up  a  hand,  her  tiny</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry’s. “Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, </p>
<p class="calibre1">are you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect)</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They  didn’t  die  in  a  car  crash!”  said  Harry,  who  found  himself  on  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  their  decent,  hardworking  relatives!”  screamed  Aunt  Marge,  swelling</p>
<p class="calibre1">with fury. “You are an insolent, ungrateful little —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible</p>
<p class="calibre1">anger — but the swelling didn’t stop. Her great red face started to expand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech — next</p>
<p class="calibre1">second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  walls  —  she  was  inflating  like  a  monstrous  balloon,  her  stomach</p>
<p class="calibre1">bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">salami —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“MARGE!”  yelled  Uncle  Vernon  and  Aunt  Petunia  together  as  Aunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marge’s whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was</p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet  stuck  out  weirdly  as  she  drifted  up  into  the  air,  making  apoplectic</p>
<p class="calibre1">popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“NOOOOOOO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle  Vernon  seized  one  of  Marge’s  feet  and  tried  to  pull  her  down</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper</p>
<p class="calibre1">leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon’s leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open</p>
<p class="calibre1">as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose</p>
<p class="calibre1">floorboard,  and  grabbed  the  pillowcase  full  of  his  books  and  birthday</p>
<p class="calibre1">presents.  He  wriggled  out,  seized  Hedwig’s  empty  cage,  and  dashed  back</p>
<p class="calibre1">downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his trouser leg in bloody tatters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“COME  BACK  IN  HERE!”  he  bellowed.  “COME  BACK  AND  PUT</p>
<p class="calibre1">HER RIGHT!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  a  reckless  rage  had  come  over  Harry.  He  kicked  his  trunk  open, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She  deserved  it,”  Harry  said,  breathing  very  fast.  “She  deserved  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she got. You keep away from me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going,” Harry said. “I’ve had enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig’s cage under his arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a><img src="index-28_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Knight Bus</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  several  streets  away  before  he  collapsed  onto  a  low  wall  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magnolia  Crescent,  panting  from  the  effort  of  dragging  his  trunk.  He  sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  after  ten  minutes  alone  in  the  dark  street,  a  new  emotion  overtook</p>
<p class="calibre1">him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse</p>
<p class="calibre1">fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowhere  to  go.  And  the  worst  of  it  was,  he  had  just  done  serious  magic, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken  the  Decree  for  the  Restriction  of  Underage  Wizardry  so  badly,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren’t swooping down on</p>
<p class="calibre1">him where he sat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  shivered  and  looked  up  and  down  Magnolia  Crescent.  What  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going  to  happen  to  him?  Would  he  be  arrested,  or  would  he  simply  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  heart  sank  even  lower.  Harry  was  sure  that,  criminal  or  not,  Ron  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  would  want  to  help  him  now,  but  they  were  both  abroad,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn’t have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in</p>
<p class="calibre1">London. He’d never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">…</p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was already expelled (his heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  magic  couldn’t  hurt.  He  had  the  Invisibility  Cloak  he  had  inherited</p>
<p class="calibre1">from his father — what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and … begin his life</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  an  outcast.  It  was  a  horrible  prospect,  but  he  couldn’t  sit  on  this  wall</p>
<p class="calibre1">forever, or he’d find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Invisibility  Cloak  —  but  before  he  had  found  it,  he  straightened  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly, looking around him once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone</p>
<p class="calibre1">from any of the large square houses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  bent  over  his  trunk  again,  but  almost  immediately  stood  up  once</p>
<p class="calibre1">more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it:</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would move, then he’d know whether it was just a stray cat or — something</p>
<p class="calibre1">else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Lumos, </i>”  Harry  muttered,  and  a  light  appeared  at  the  end  of  his  wand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls  of  number  two  suddenly  sparkled;  the  garage  door  gleamed,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something</p>
<p class="calibre1">very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand</p>
<p class="calibre1">flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hard, in the gutter —</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes against a sudden blinding light —</p>
<p class="calibre1">With  a  yell,  he  rolled  back  onto  the  pavement,  just  in  time.  A  second</p>
<p class="calibre1">later,  a  gigantic  pair  of  wheels  and  headlights  screeched  to  a  halt  exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  Harry  had  just  been  lying.  They  belonged,  as  Harry  saw  when  he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled  <i class="calibre3">The Knight Bus. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak loudly to the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch</p>
<p class="calibre1">or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board, and we can take</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  anywhere  you  want  to  go.  My  name  is  Stan  Shunpike,  and  I  will  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">your conductor this eve —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of Harry, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  still  sitting  on  the  ground.  Harry  snatched  up  his  wand  again  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few</p>
<p class="calibre1">years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears and quite a few pimples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you doin’ down there?” said Stan, dropping his professional</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fell over,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Choo fall over for?” sniggered Stan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">jeans  was  torn,  and  the  hand  he  had  thrown  out  to  break  his  fall  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bleeding.  He  suddenly  remembered  why  he  had  fallen  over  and  turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knight Bus’s headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Choo lookin’ at?” said Stan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There was a big black thing,” said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gap. “Like a dog … but massive …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">of unease, Harry saw Stan’s eyes move to the scar on Harry’s forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Woss that on your ’ead?” said Stan abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,”  said  Harry  quickly,  flattening  his  hair  over  his  scar.  If  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn’t want to make it too easy</p>
<p class="calibre1">for them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Woss your name?” Stan persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville Longbottom,” said Harry, saying the first name that came into</p>
<p class="calibre1">his head. “So — so this bus,” he went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“did you say it goes  <i class="calibre3">anywhere</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>“Yep,” said Stan proudly, “anywhere you like, long’s it’s on land. Can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">do  nuffink  underwater.  ’Ere,”  he  said,  looking  suspicious  again,  “you   <i class="calibre3">did</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand ’and, dincha?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”  said  Harry  quickly.  “Listen,  how  much  would  it  be  to  get  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">London?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eleven Sickles,” said Stan, “but for firteen you get ’ot chocolate, and for</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifteen  you  get  an  ’ot  water  bottle  an’  a  toofbrush  in  the  color  of  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoved some gold into Stan’s hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedwig’s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the bus muttered, “Not now, thanks, I’m pickling some slugs” and rolled</p>
<p class="calibre1">over in his sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You ’ave this one,” Stan whispered, shoving Harry’s trunk under the bed</p>
<p class="calibre1">right  behind  the  driver,  who  was  sitting  in  an  armchair  in  front  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">steering  wheel.  “This  is  our  driver,  Ernie  Prang.  This  is  Neville</p>
<p class="calibre1">Longbottom, Ern.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernie  Prang,  an  elderly  wizard  wearing  very  thick  glasses,  nodded  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take  ’er  away,  Ern,”  said  Stan,  sitting  down  in  the  armchair  next  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernie’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s stunned face with great enjoyment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he said. “Where are</p>
<p class="calibre1">we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ar,” said Ernie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How come the Muggles don’t hear the bus?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don’ listen properly, do they? Don’</p>
<p class="calibre1">look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Best  go  wake  up  Madam  Marsh,  Stan,”  said  Ern.  “We’ll  be  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Abergavenny in a minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a><img src="index-32_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan passed Harry’s bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  still  looking  out  of  the  window,  feeling  increasingly  nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernie didn’t seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bus  kept  mounting  the  pavement,  but  it  didn’t  hit  anything;  lines  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lampposts,  mailboxes,  and  trash  cans  jumped  out  of  its  way  as  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">approached and back into position once it had passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a traveling cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Ere you go, Madam Marsh,” said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brake  and  the  beds  slid  a  foot  or  so  toward  the  front  of  the  bus.  Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marsh  clamped  a  handkerchief  to  her  mouth  and  tottered  down  the  steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan  threw  her  bag  out  after  her  and  rammed  the  doors  shut;  there  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trees leaping out of the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bus that didn’t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  stomach  churned  as  he  fell  back  to  wondering  what  was  going  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge</p>
<p class="calibre1">off the ceiling yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan had unfurled a copy of the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> and was now reading with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  tongue  between  his  teeth.  A  large  photograph  of  a  sunken-faced  man</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  long,  matted  hair  blinked  slowly  at  Harry  from  the  front  page.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked strangely familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That man!” Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. “He was</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the Muggle news!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius Black,” he said, nodding. “ ’Course ’e was on the Muggle news, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville, where you been?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  gave  a  superior  sort  of  chuckle  at  the  blank  look  on  Harry’s  face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">removed the front page, and handed it to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You oughta read the papers more, Neville.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Sirius  Black,  possibly  the  most  infamous  </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">prisoner  ever  to  be  held  in</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">today. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a> <i class="calibre3">“We  are  doing  all  we  can  to  recapture  Black,”  said  the  Minister  of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Magic,  Cornelius  Fudge,  this  morning,  “and  we  beg  the  magical</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">community to remain calm.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Fudge  has  been  criticized  by  some  members  of  the  International</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Federation  of  Warlocks  for  informing  the  Muggle  Prime  Minister  of  the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">crisis. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Well, really, I had to, don’t you know,” said</i>  <i class="calibre3">an irritable</i>  <i class="calibre3">Fudge. “Black</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">is mad. He’s a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">the Prime Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black’s</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">true identity to anyone. And let’s face it — who’d believe him if he did?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">While  Muggles  have  been  told  that  Black  is  carrying  a  gun  (a  kind  of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">metal  wand  that  Muggles  use  to  kill  each  other),  the  magical  community</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">lives  in  fear  of  a  massacre  like  that  of  twelve  years  ago,  when  Black</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">murdered thirteen people with a single curse. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen  pictures  of  them  in  his  Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts  classes,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scary-lookin’ fing, inee?” said Stan, who had been watching Harry read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  murdered   <i class="calibre3">thirteen  people</i>?”  said  Harry,  handing  the  page  back  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan, “with  <i class="calibre3">one curse</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,”  said  Stan,  “in  front  of  witnesses  an’  all.  Broad  daylight.  Big</p>
<p class="calibre1">trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ar,” said Ern darkly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-’Oo,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  Stan’s  pimples  went  white;  Ern  jerked  the  steering  wheel  so  hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You outta your tree?” yelped Stan. “ ’Choo say ’is name for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,” said Harry hastily. “Sorry, I — I forgot —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forgot!” said Stan weakly. “Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’ that fast …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?” Harry prompted</p>
<p class="calibre1">apologetically. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>“Yeah,” said Stan, still rubbing his chest. “Yeah, that’s right. Very close</p>
<p class="calibre1">to You-Know-’Oo, they say. Anyway, when little ’Arry Potter got the better</p>
<p class="calibre1">of You-Know-’Oo —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— all You-Know-’Oo’s supporters was tracked down, wasn’t they, Ern? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of ’em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-’Oo gone, and they came</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet. But not Sirius Black. I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in-command</p>
<p class="calibre1">once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles</p>
<p class="calibre1">an’ Black took out ’is wand and ’e blasted ’alf the street apart, an’ a wizard</p>
<p class="calibre1">got it, an’ so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. ’Orrible, eh? An’</p>
<p class="calibre1">you know what Black did then?” Stan continued in a dramatic whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Laughed</i>,”  said  Stan.  “Jus’  stood  there  an’  laughed.  An’  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, ’e went wiv ’em quiet</p>
<p class="calibre1">as anyfink, still laughing ’is ’ead off. ’Cos ’e’s mad, inee, Ern? Inee mad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If he weren’t when he went to Azkaban, he will be now,” said Ern in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">slow voice. “I’d blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves him</p>
<p class="calibre1">right, mind you … after what he did. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They ’ad a job coverin’ it up, din’ they, Ern?” Stan said. “ ’Ole street</p>
<p class="calibre1">blown up an’ all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ’ad ’appened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ern?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gas explosion,” grunted Ernie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An’  now  ’e’s  out,”  said  Stan,  examining  the  newspaper  picture  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s gaunt face again. “Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, ’as</p>
<p class="calibre1">there, Ern? Beats me ’ow ’e did it. Frightenin’, eh? Mind, I don’t fancy ’is</p>
<p class="calibre1">chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernie suddenly shivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talk about summat else, Stan, there’s a good lad. Them Azkaban guards</p>
<p class="calibre1">give me the collywobbles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Knight  Bus,  feeling  worse  than  ever.  He  couldn’t  help  imagining</p>
<p class="calibre1">what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights’ time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Ear about that ’Arry Potter? Blew up ’is aunt! We ’ad ’im ’ere on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knight Bus, di’n’t we, Ern? ’E was tryin’ to run for it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He,  Harry,  had  broken  wizard  law  just  like  Sirius  Black.  Was  inflating</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aunt  Marge  bad  enough  to  land  him  in  Azkaban?  Harry  didn’t  know</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he’d ever heard speak of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  did  so  in  the  same  fearful  tone.  Hagrid,  the  Hogwarts  gamekeeper,  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn’t soon forget the look</p>
<p class="calibre1">of terror on Hagrid’s face when he had been told where he was going, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Knight  Bus  rolled  through  the  darkness,  scattering  bushes  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wastebaskets,  telephone  booths  and  trees,  and  Harry  lay,  restless  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">miserable,  on  his  feather  bed.  After  a  while,  Stan  remembered  that  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry’s pillow when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bus moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and</p>
<p class="calibre1">witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Harry was the only passenger left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right  then,  Neville,”  said  Stan,  clapping  his  hands,  “whereabouts  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">London?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Diagon Alley,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Righto,” said Stan. “ ’Old tight, then …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">BANG! </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  thundering  along  Charing  Cross  Road.  Harry  sat  up  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched  buildings  and  benches  squeezing  themselves  out  of  the  Knight</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bus’s  way.  The  sky  was  getting  a  little  lighter.  He  would  lie  low  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple  of  hours,  go  to  Gringotts  the  moment  it  opened,  then  set  off  —</p>
<p class="calibre1">where, he didn’t know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a small and shabby-looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">the magical entrance to Diagon Alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,” Harry said to Ern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cage onto the pavement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Harry. “ ’Bye then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Stan wasn’t paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">There</i> you are, Harry,” said a voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan shouted, “Blimey! Ern, come ’ere! Come  <i class="calibre3">’ere</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  looked  up  at  the  owner  of  the  hand  on  his  shoulder  and  felt  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bucketful  of  ice  cascade  into  his  stomach  —  he  had  walked  right  into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What didja call Neville, Minister?” he said excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge,  a  portly  little  man  in  a  long,  pinstriped  cloak,  looked  cold  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhausted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville?” he repeated, frowning. “This is Harry Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I knew it!” Stan shouted gleefully. “Ern! Ern! Guess ’oo Neville is, Ern! </p>
<p class="calibre1">’E’s ’Arry Potter! I can see ’is scar!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”  said  Fudge  testily,  “well,  I’m  very  glad  the  Knight  Bus  picked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge  increased  the  pressure  on  Harry’s  shoulder,  and  Harry  found</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself  being  steered  inside  the  pub.  A  stooping  figure  bearing  a  lantern</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared  through  the  door  behind  the  bar.  It  was  Tom,  the  wizened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">toothless landlord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got him, Minister!” said Tom. “Will you be wanting anything? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beer? Brandy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps a pot of tea,” said Fudge, who still hadn’t let go of Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ern  appeared,  carrying  Harry’s  trunk  and  Hedwig’s  cage  and  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">around excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“  ’Ow  come  you  di’n’t  tell  us  ’oo  you  are,  eh,  Neville?”  said  Stan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">beaming at Harry, while Ernie’s owlish face peered interestedly over Stan’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And a  <i class="calibre3">private</i> parlor, please, Tom,” said Fudge pointedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Bye,” Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward the passage that led from the bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Bye, Neville!” called Stan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom’s lantern, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grate, and he bowed himself out of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit down, Harry,” said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  fire.  Fudge  took  off  his  pinstriped  cloak  and  tossed  it  aside,  then</p>
<p class="calibre1">hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  he  had  been  wearing  his  father’s  Invisibility  Cloak  at  the  time,  Fudge</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>wasn’t to know that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table between</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Harry,” said Fudge, pouring out tea, “you’ve had us all in a right</p>
<p class="calibre1">flap,  I  don’t  mind  telling  you.  Running  away  from  your  aunt  and  uncle’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">house  like  that!  I’d  started  to  think  …  but  you’re  safe,  and  that’s  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">matters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eat,  Harry,  you  look  dead  on  your  feet.  Now  then  …  You  will  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marjorie  Dursley.  Two  members  of  the  Accidental  Magic  Reversal  Squad</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  dispatched  to  Privet  Drive  a  few  hours  ago.  Miss  Dursley  has  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">punctured  and  her  memory  has  been  modified.  She  has  no  recollection  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the incident at all. So that’s that, and no harm done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge  smiled  at  Harry  over  the  rim  of  his  teacup,  rather  like  an  uncle</p>
<p class="calibre1">surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn’t believe his ears, opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">his mouth to speak, couldn’t think of anything to say, and closed it again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,  you’re  worrying  about  the  reaction  of  your  aunt  and  uncle?”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge. “Well, I won’t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the Christmas and Easter holidays.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry unstuck his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  <i class="calibre3">always</i>  stay  at  Hogwarts  for  the  Christmas  and  Easter  holidays,”  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said, “and I don’t ever want to go back to Privet Drive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, now, I’m sure you’ll feel differently once you’ve calmed down,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Fudge in a worried tone. “They are your family, after all, and I’m sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">you are fond of each other — er —  <i class="calibre3">very</i> deep down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It didn’t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was going to happen to him now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So  all  that  remains,”  said  Fudge,  now  buttering  himself  a  second</p>
<p class="calibre1">crumpet, “is to decide where you’re going to spend the last three weeks of</p>
<p class="calibre1">your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on,” blurted Harry. “What about my punishment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge blinked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Punishment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>“I  broke  the  law!”  Harry  said.  “The  Decree  for  the  Restriction  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Underage Wizardry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  my  dear  boy,  we’re  not  going  to  punish  you  for  a  little  thing  like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that!” cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. “It was an accident! We</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this didn’t tally at all with Harry’s past dealings with the Ministry of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pudding in my uncle’s house!” he told Fudge, frowning. “The Ministry of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic  said  I’d  be  expelled  from  Hogwarts  if  there  was  any  more  magic</p>
<p class="calibre1">there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless  Harry’s  eyes  were  deceiving  him,  Fudge  was  suddenly  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">awkward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Circumstances change, Harry. … We have to take into account … in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">present climate … Surely you don’t  <i class="calibre3">want</i> to be expelled?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course I don’t,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well  then,  what’s  all  the  fuss  about?”  laughed  Fudge.  “Now,  have  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom’s got a room for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge  strode  out  of  the  parlor  and  Harry  stared  after  him.  There  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Leaky  Cauldron,  if  not  to  punish  him  for  what  he’d  done?  And  now</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn’t usual for the Minister of Magic</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">himself</i> to get involved in matters of underage magic? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Room  eleven’s  free,  Harry,”  said  Fudge.  “I  think  you’ll  be  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable. Just one thing, and I’m sure you’ll understand … I don’t want</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  wandering  off  into  Muggle  London,  all  right?  Keep  to  Diagon  Alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And you’re to be back here before dark each night. Sure you’ll understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Harry slowly, “but why — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t want to lose you again, do we?” said Fudge with a hearty laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no … best we know where you are. … I mean …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you had any luck with Black yet?” Harry asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge’s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>“What’s that? Oh, you’ve heard — well, no, not yet, but it’s only a matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed … and they are angrier</p>
<p class="calibre1">than I’ve ever seen them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge shuddered slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I’ll say good-bye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — Minister? Can I ask you something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,” said Fudge with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my</p>
<p class="calibre1">aunt and uncle didn’t sign the permission form. D’you think you could —</p>
<p class="calibre1">?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge was looking uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” he said. “No, no, I’m very sorry, Harry, but as I’m not your parent</p>
<p class="calibre1">or guardian —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said Harry eagerly. “If you gave me</p>
<p class="calibre1">permission —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,  I’m  sorry,  Harry,  but  rules  are  rules,”  said  Fudge  flatly.  “Perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it’s best if you</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t … yes … well, I’ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  with  a  last  smile  and  shake  of  Harry’s  hand,  Fudge  left  the  room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you’ll follow me, Mr. Potter,” he said, “I’ve already taken your things</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  followed  Tom  up  a  handsome  wooden  staircase  to  a  door  with  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">brass number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside  was  a  very  comfortable-looking  bed,  some  highly  polished  oak</p>
<p class="calibre1">furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hedwig!” Harry gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry’s arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very  smart  owl  you’ve  got  there,”  chuckled  Tom.  “Arrived  about  five</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes  after  you  did.  If  there’s  anything  you  need,  Mr.  Potter,  don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">hesitate to ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gave another bow and left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  sat  on  his  bed  for  a  long  time,  absentmindedly  stroking  Hedwig. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  cold,  steely  gray  and  then,  slowly,  to  pink  shot  with  gold.  Harry  could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>hardly  believe  that  he’d  left  Privet  Drive  only  a  few  hours  ago,  that  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t expelled, and that he was now facing three Dursley-free weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,” he yawned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  without  even  removing  his  glasses,  he  slumped  back  onto  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pillows and fell asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a><img src="index-41_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Leaky Cauldron</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never</p>
<p class="calibre1">before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he</p>
<p class="calibre1">fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in Diagon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating</p>
<p class="calibre1">wizarding  shops  in  the  world,  Harry  felt  no  desire  to  break  his  word  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching  the  other  guests:  funny  little  witches  from  the  country,  up  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">day’s shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Transfiguration  Today</i>;  wild-looking  warlocks;  raucous  dwarfs;  and  once, </p>
<p class="calibre1">what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind a thick woollen balaclava. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brightly  colored  umbrellas  outside  cafes,  where  his  fellow  diners  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">showing one another their purchases (“it’s a lunascope, old boy — no more</p>
<p class="calibre1">messing  around  with  moon  charts,  see?”)  or  else  discussing  the  case  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius Black (“personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone until he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a><img src="index-42_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">back  in  Azkaban”).  Harry  didn’t  have  to  do  his  homework  under  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">blankets  by  flashlight  anymore;  now  he  could  sit  in  the  bright  sunshine</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his essays with</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">great  deal  about  medieval  witch  burnings,  gave  Harry  free  sundaes  every</p>
<p class="calibre1">half an hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  Harry  had  refilled  his  money  bag  with  gold  Galleons,  silver</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot  of  self-control  not  to  spend  the  whole  lot  at  once.  He  had  to  keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminding  himself  that  he  had  five  years  to  go  at  Hogwarts,  and  how  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  feel  to  ask  the  Dursleys  for  money  for  spellbooks,  to  stop  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  buying  a  handsome  set  of  solid  gold  Gobstones  (a  wizarding  game</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the other player’s face when they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  the  perfect,  moving  model  of  the  galaxy  in  a  large  glass  ball,  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson. But the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  that  tested  Harry’s  resolution  most  appeared  in  his  favorite  shop, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quality  Quidditch  Supplies,  a  week  after  he’d  arrived  at  the  Leaky</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cauldron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged</p>
<p class="calibre1">his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  glimpsed  a  newly  erected  podium,  on  which  was  mounted  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just  come  out  —  prototype  —”  a  square-jawed  wizard  was  telling  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  the  fastest  broom  in  the  world,  isn’t  it,  Dad?”  squeaked  a  boy</p>
<p class="calibre1">younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father’s arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Irish  International  Side’s  just  put  in  an  order  for  seven  of  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">beauties!” the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. “And they’re favorites</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the World Cup!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign</p>
<p class="calibre1">next to the broom:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">This  state-of-the-art  racing  broom  sports  a  stream-lined,  superfine  handle</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">of ash, treated with a diamond-hard polish and hand-numbered with its own</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">registration number. Each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a> <i class="calibre3">has  been  honed  to  aerodynamic  perfection,  giving  the  Firebolt</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">unsurpassable  balance  and  pinpoint  precision.  The  Firebolt  has  an</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">acceleration  of  150  miles  an  hour  in  ten  seconds  and  incorporates  an</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">unbreakable Braking Charm. Price on request. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Price on request … Harry didn’t like to think how much gold the Firebolt</p>
<p class="calibre1">would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life — but</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  had  never  lost  a  Quidditch  match  on  his  Nimbus  Two  Thousand,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  a  very  good  broom  already?  Harry  didn’t  ask  for  the  price,  but  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were,  however,  things  that  Harry  needed  to  buy.  He  went  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his school</p>
<p class="calibre1">robes  were  now  several  inches  too  short  in  the  arm  and  leg,  he  visited</p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam  Malkin’s  Robes  for  All  Occasions  and  bought  new  ones.  Most</p>
<p class="calibre1">important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include</p>
<p class="calibre1">those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  usual  display  of  gold-embossed  spellbooks  the  size  of  paving  slabs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there  was  a  large  iron  cage  behind  the  glass  that  held  about  a  hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">copies  of   <i class="calibre3">The  Monster  Book  of  Monsters. </i>  Torn  pages  were  flying</p>
<p class="calibre1">everywhere  as  the  books  grappled  with  each  other,  locked  together  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">time.  <i class="calibre3">The  Monster  Book  of  Monsters</i>  was  listed  as  the  required  book  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  come  in  useful.  He  felt  relieved;  he  had  been  wondering  whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hogwarts?” he said abruptly. “Come to get your new books?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry, “I need —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">stick, and proceeded toward the door of the  <i class="calibre3">Monster Books’</i> cage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on,” said Harry quickly, “I’ve already got one of those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>“Have you?” A look of enormous relief spread over the manager’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank  heavens  for  that.  I’ve  been  bitten  five  times  already  this  morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the  <i class="calibre3">Monster Books</i> had seized a</p>
<p class="calibre1">third and were pulling it apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop  it!  Stop  it!”  cried  the  manager,  poking  the  walking  stick  through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  bars  and  knocking  the  books  apart.  “I’m  never  stocking  them  again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">never! It’s been bedlam! I thought we’d seen the worst when we bought two</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred copies of the  <i class="calibre3">Invisible Book of Invisibility</i> — cost a fortune, and we</p>
<p class="calibre1">never found them. … Well … is there anything else I can help you with?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”  said  Harry,  looking  down  his  booklist,  “I  need   <i class="calibre3">Unfogging  the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Future</i> by Cassandra Vablatsky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,  starting  Divination,  are  you?”  said  the  manager,  stripping  off  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">gloves  and  leading  Harry  into  the  back  of  the  shop,  where  there  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with volumes</p>
<p class="calibre1">such as  <i class="calibre3">Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against Shocks</i> and</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here you are,” said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to take</p>
<p class="calibre1">down a thick, black-bound book. “<i class="calibre3">Unfogging the Future. </i> Very good guide</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  all  your  basic  fortune-telling  methods  —  palmistry,  crystal  balls,  bird</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrails —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry wasn’t listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was among a display on a small table:  <i class="calibre3">Death Omens: What to Do When You</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Know the Worst Is Coming. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I wouldn’t read that if I were you,” said the manager lightly, looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  see  what  Harry  was  staring  at.  “You’ll  start  seeing  death  omens</p>
<p class="calibre1">everywhere. It’s enough to frighten anyone to death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a</p>
<p class="calibre1">black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">The manager pressed  <i class="calibre3">Unfogging the Future</i> into Harry’s hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything else?” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”  said  Harry,  tearing  his  eyes  away  from  the  dog’s  and  dazedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">consulting his booklist. “Er — I need  <i class="calibre3">Intermediate Transfiguration</i> and  <i class="calibre3">The</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new</p>
<p class="calibre1">books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticing where he was going and bumping into several people. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto  his  bed.  Somebody  had  been  in  to  tidy;  the  windows  were  open  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muggle  street  behind  him  and  the  sound  of  the  invisible  crowd  below  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It can’t have been a death omen,” he told his reflection defiantly. “I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent. … It was probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">just a stray dog. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re fighting a losing battle there, dear,” said his mirror in a wheezy</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  too  were  ogling  the  Firebolt;  he  also  ran  into  the  real  Neville</p>
<p class="calibre1">Longbottom,  a  round-faced,  forgetful  boy,  outside  Flourish  and  Blotts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  being  told  off  by  his  very  formidable-looking  grandmother.  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped she never found out that he’d pretended to be Neville while on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">run from the Ministry of Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  woke  on  the  last  day  of  the  holidays,  thinking  that  he  would  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got</p>
<p class="calibre1">up,  dressed,  went  for  a  last  look  at  the  Firebolt,  and  was  just  wondering</p>
<p class="calibre1">where he’d have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he turned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! HARRY!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  there,  both  of  them,  sitting  outside  Florean  Fortescue’s  Ice</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cream  Parlor  —  Ron  looking  incredibly  freckly  Hermione  very  brown, </p>
<p class="calibre1">both waving frantically at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Finally!” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. “We went to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaky  Cauldron,  but  they  said  you’d  left,  and  we  went  to  Flourish  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blotts, and Madam Malkin’s, and —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got all my school stuff last week,” Harry explained. “And how come</p>
<p class="calibre1">you knew I’m staying at the Leaky Cauldron?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad,” said Ron simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Mr.  Weasley,  who  worked  at  the  Ministry  of  Magic,  would  of  course</p>
<p class="calibre1">have heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did  you   <i class="calibre3">really</i>  blow  up  your  aunt,  Harry?”  said  Hermione  in  a  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t mean to,” said Harry while Ron roared with laughter. “I just —</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost control.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  not  funny,  Ron,”  said  Hermione  sharply.  “Honestly,  I’m  amazed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wasn’t expelled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So am I,” admitted Harry. “Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrested.” He looked at Ron. “Your dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, </p>
<p class="calibre1">does he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably  ’cause  it’s  you,  isn’t  it?”  shrugged  Ron,  still  chuckling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate to see what the Ministry’d do to</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">me</i> if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re  staying  at  the  Leaky  Cauldron  tonight  too!  So  you  can  come  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">King’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as well!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  nodded,  beaming.  “Mum  and  Dad  dropped  me  off  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning with all my Hogwarts things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent!”  said  Harry  happily.  “So,  have  you  got  all  your  new  books</p>
<p class="calibre1">and stuff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at this,” said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. “Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair. And we’ve got all our books —” He pointed at a large bag under his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair.  “What  about  those   <i class="calibre3">Monster  Books, </i>  eh?  The  assistant  nearly  cried</p>
<p class="calibre1">when we said we wanted two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s all that, Hermione?” Harry asked, pointing at not one but three</p>
<p class="calibre1">bulging bags in the chair next to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t I?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those  are  my  books  for  Arithmancy,  Care  of  Magical  Creatures, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said Ron, rolling his eyes at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry. “You’re Muggle-born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already</p>
<p class="calibre1">know all about Muggles!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione earnestly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>“Are  you  planning  to  eat  or  sleep  at  all  this  year,  Hermione?”  asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve  still  got  ten  Galleons,”  she  said,  checking  her  purse.  “It’s  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">birthday  in  September,  and  Mum  and  Dad  gave  me  some  money  to  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself an early birthday present.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How about a nice  <i class="calibre3">book</i>?” said Ron innocently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I don’t think so,” said Hermione composedly. “I really want an owl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean, Harry’s got Hedwig and you’ve got Errol —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t,” said Ron. “Errol’s a family owl. All I’ve got is Scabbers.” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. “And I want to get him checked over,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  added,  placing  Scabbers  on  the  table  in  front  of  them.  “I  don’t  think</p>
<p class="calibre1">Egypt agreed with him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop</p>
<p class="calibre1">to his whiskers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry, who knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">Diagon Alley very well by now. “You could see if they’ve got anything for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  they  paid  for  their  ice  cream  and  crossed  the  street  to  the  Magical</p>
<p class="calibre1">Menagerie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all</p>
<p class="calibre1">squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the counter</p>
<p class="calibre1">was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">blowflies.  A  gigantic  tortoise  with  a  jewel-encrusted  shell  was  glittering</p>
<p class="calibre1">near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and</p>
<p class="calibre1">back again with a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every color, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny custard-colored furballs that were</p>
<p class="calibre1">humming  loudly,  and  on  the  counter,  a  vast  cage  of  sleek  black  rats  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">were playing some sort of skipping game using their long, bald tails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  my  rat,”  he  told  the  witch.  “He  been  a  bit  off-color  ever  since  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought him back from Egypt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bang him on the counter,” said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black</p>
<p class="calibre1">spectacles out of her pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wire for a better look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had once belonged to Ron’s brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hm,” said the witch, picking up Scabbers. “How old is this rat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno,” said Ron. “Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  powers  does  he  have?”  said  the  witch,  examining  Scabbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">closely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er —” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting  powers.  The  witch’s  eyes  moved  from  Scabbers’s  tattered  left</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s been through the mill, this one,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was like that when Percy gave him to me,” said Ron defensively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An  ordinary  common  or  garden  rat  like  this  can’t  be  expected  to  live</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer than three years or so,” said the witch. “Now, if you were looking for</p>
<p class="calibre1">something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  indicated  the  black  rats,  who  promptly  started  skipping  again.  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">muttered, “Show-offs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if you don’t want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,” said</p>
<p class="calibre1">the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Ron. “How much — OUCH!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  highest  cage,  landed  on  his  head,  and  then  propelled  itself,  spitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">madly, at Scabbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!” cried the witch, but Scabbers shot from</p>
<p class="calibre1">between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then scampered for the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scabbers!”  Ron  shouted,  racing  out  of  the  shop  after  him;  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge</p>
<p class="calibre1">under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  <i class="calibre3">was</i> that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>“Probably getting her owl —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  made  their  way  back  up  the  crowded  street  to  the  Magical</p>
<p class="calibre1">Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  <i class="calibre3">bought</i> that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  <i class="calibre3">gorgeous, </i> isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  was  a  matter  of  opinion,  thought  Harry.  The  cat’s  ginger  fur  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick  and  fluffy,  but  it  was  definitely  a  bit  bowlegged  and  its  face  looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">grumpy  and  oddly  squashed,  as  though  it  had  run  headlong  into  a  brick</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall.  Now  that  Scabbers  was  out  of  sight,  however,  the  cat  was  purring</p>
<p class="calibre1">contentedly in Hermione’s arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket.  “He  needs  rest  and  relaxation!  How’s  he  going  to  get  it  with  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing around?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  reminds  me,  you  forgot  your  rat  tonic,”  said  Hermione,  slapping</p>
<p class="calibre1">the small red bottle into Ron’s hand. “And stop  <i class="calibre3">worrying, </i> Crookshanks will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  sleeping  in  my  dormitory  and  Scabbers  in  yours,  what’s  the  problem? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor  Crookshanks,  that  witch  said  he’d  been  in  there  for  ages;  no  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder why,” said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cauldron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up. “How are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine, thanks,” said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley</p>
<p class="calibre1">with all their shopping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Sirius Black staring up at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They still haven’t caught him, then?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. “They’ve pulled us all</p>
<p class="calibre1">off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would we get a reward if we caught him?” asked Ron. “It’d be good to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get some more money —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked very strained. “Black’s not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old</p>
<p class="calibre1">wizard. It’s the Azkaban guards who’ll get him back, you mark my words.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags</p>
<p class="calibre1">and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifth  year  at  Hogwarts;  the  newly  elected  Head  Boy,  Percy;  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasleys’ youngest child and only girl, Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more</p>
<p class="calibre1">heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">saved  her  life  during  their  previous  year  at  Hogwarts.  She  went  very  red</p>
<p class="calibre1">and muttered “hello” without looking at him. Percy, however, held out his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand  solemnly  as  though  he  and  Harry  had  never  met  and  said,  “Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How nice to see you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Percy,” said Harry, trying not to laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope you’re well?” said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">like being introduced to the mayor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well, thanks —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simply  <i class="calibre3">splendid</i> to see you, old boy —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marvelous,” said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry’s hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">in turn. “Absolutely spiffing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy scowled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s enough, now,” said Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mum!”  said  Fred  as  though  he’d  only  just  spotted  her  and  seizing  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand too. “How really corking to see you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I said, that’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an</p>
<p class="calibre1">empty  chair.  “Hello,  Harry,  dear.  I  suppose  you’ve  heard  our  exciting</p>
<p class="calibre1">news?”  She  pointed  to  the  brand-new  silver  badge  on  Percy’s  chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling with pride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And last,” Fred muttered under his breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t doubt that,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. “I notice they</p>
<p class="calibre1">haven’t made you two prefects.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do we want to be prefects for?” said George, looking revolted at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the very idea. “It’d take all the fun out of life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny giggled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  want  to  set  a  better  example  for  your  sister!”  snapped  Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ginny’s  got  other  brothers  to  set  her  an  example,  Mother,”  said  Percy</p>
<p class="calibre1">loftily. “I’m going up to change for dinner. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He disappeared and George heaved a sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>“We  tried  to  shut  him  in  a  pyramid,”  he  told  Harry.  “But  Mum  spotted</p>
<p class="calibre1">us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dinner  that  night  was  a  very  enjoyable  affair.  Tom  the  innkeeper  put</p>
<p class="calibre1">three  tables  together  in  the  parlor,  and  the  seven  Weasleys,  Harry,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’re we getting to King’s Cross tomorrow, Dad?” asked Fred as they</p>
<p class="calibre1">dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Ministry’s providing a couple of cars,” said Mr. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone looked up at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” said Percy curiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s because of you, Perce,” said George seriously. “And there’ll be little</p>
<p class="calibre1">flags on the hoods, with HB on them —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— for Humongous Bighead,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?” Percy asked again, in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dignified voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mr. Weasley, “— and as I</p>
<p class="calibre1">work there, they’re doing me a favor —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice was casual, but Harry couldn’t help noticing that Mr. Weasley’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears had gone red, just like Ron’s did when he was under pressure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good thing, too,” said Mrs. Weasley briskly. “Do you realize how much</p>
<p class="calibre1">luggage you’ve all got between you? A nice sight you’d be on the Muggle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Underground. … You are all packed, aren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron hasn’t put all his new things in his trunk yet,” said Percy, in a long-</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering voice. “He’s dumped them on my bed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won’t have much</p>
<p class="calibre1">time in the morning,” Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  dinner  everyone  felt  very  full  and  sleepy.  One  by  one  they  made</p>
<p class="calibre1">their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and locked his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was going on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was  <i class="calibre3">here, </i> on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t touched it, all right?” Ron roared back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>“What’s up?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Head Boy badge is gone,” said Percy, rounding on Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So’s Scabbers’s rat tonic,” said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look. “I think I might’ve left it in the bar —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not going anywhere till you’ve found my badge!” yelled Percy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll  get  Scabbers’s  stuff,  I’m  packed,”  Harry  said  to  Ron,  and  he  went</p>
<p class="calibre1">downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  halfway  along  the  passage  to  the  bar,  which  was  now  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasleys’. He hesitated, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not wanting them to know he’d heard them arguing, when the sound of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“… makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry’s  got  a  right  to  know.  I’ve  tried  to  tell  Fudge,  but  he  insists  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">treating Harry like a child. He’s thirteen years old and —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arthur, the truth would terrify him!” said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. “Do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him? For</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven’s sake, he’s  <i class="calibre3">happy</i> not knowing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">retorted Mr. Weasley. “You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering</p>
<p class="calibre1">off by themselves — they’ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest! But</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry mustn’t do that this year! When I think what could have happened to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn’t picked him</p>
<p class="calibre1">up, I’m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he’s  <i class="calibre3">not</i> dead, he’s fine, so what’s the point —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Molly, they say Sirius Black’s mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough to escape from Azkaban, and that’s supposed to be impossible. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">been a month, and no one’s seen hide nor hair of him, and I don’t care what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge keeps telling the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet, </i> we’re no nearer catching Black than</p>
<p class="calibre1">inventing  self-spelling  wands.  The  only  thing  we  know  for  sure  is  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s after —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  thought  Azkaban  was  perfectly  safe.  If  Black  can  break  out  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But no one’s really sure that Black’s after Harry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged</p>
<p class="calibre1">his fist on the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn’t report it in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban</p>
<p class="calibre1">the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Black’s been talking in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  sleep  for  a  while  now.  Always  the  same  words:  ‘He’s  at  Hogwarts  …</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s at Hogwarts.’ Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to</p>
<p class="calibre1">power. Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  silence.  Harry  leaned  still  closer  to  the  door,  desperate  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you’re forgetting</p>
<p class="calibre1">Albus  Dumbledore.  I  don’t  think  anything  could  hurt  Harry  at  Hogwarts</p>
<p class="calibre1">while Dumbledore’s headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards</p>
<p class="calibre1">stationing  themselves  around  the  entrances  to  the  school  grounds.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t happy about it, but he agreed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not  happy?  Why  shouldn’t  he  be  happy,  if  they’re  there  to  catch</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore  isn’t  fond  of  the  Azkaban  guards,”  said  Mr.  Weasley</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavily. “Nor am I, if it comes to that … but when you’re dealing with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wizard  like  Black,  you  sometimes  have  to  join  forces  with  those  you’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather avoid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If they save Harry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— then I will never say another word against them,” said Mr. Weasley</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearily. “It’s late, Molly, we’d better go up. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  heard  chairs  move.  As  quietly  as  he  could,  he  hurried  down  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">passage  to  the  bar  and  out  of  sight.  The  parlor  door  opened,  and  a  few</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  waited  until  he  heard  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Weasley’s  bedroom  door  close, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then headed back upstairs with the bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron’s room in</p>
<p class="calibre1">search of his badge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>“We’ve got it,” Fred whispered to Harry. “We’ve been improving it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The badge now read  <i class="calibre3">Bighead Boy. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his room and lay down on his bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  Sirius  Black  was  after  him.  This  explained  everything.  Fudge  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">made  Harry  promise  to  stay  in  Diagon  Alley  where  there  were  plenty  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry until he was on the train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why</p>
<p class="calibre1">he didn’t feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with</p>
<p class="calibre1">one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-</p>
<p class="calibre1">stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Mrs.  Weasley  that  the  safest  place  on  earth  was  wherever  Albus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore  happened  to  be.  Didn’t  people  always  say  that  Dumbledore</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as Voldemort’s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed all</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the school, Black’s chances of getting inside seemed very remote. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,  all  in  all,  the  thing  that  bothered  Harry  most  was  the  fact  that  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact, Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  scowled  at  the  dark  ceiling.  Did  they  think  he  couldn’t  look  after</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself?  He’d  escaped  Lord  Voldemort  three  times;  he  wasn’t  completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">useless. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent</p>
<p class="calibre1">crossed his mind.  <i class="calibre3">What to do when you know the worst is coming. …</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  <i class="calibre3">not</i> going to be murdered,” Harry said out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s the spirit, dear,” said his mirror sleepily. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a><img src="index-55_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Dementor</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup</p>
<p class="calibre1">of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The sooner we get on the train, the better,” he said. “At least I can get</p>
<p class="calibre1">away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he’s accusing me of dripping tea on his</p>
<p class="calibre1">photo  of  Penelope  Clearwater.  You  know,”  Ron  grimaced,  “his   <i class="calibre3">girlfriend. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s  hidden  her  face  under  the  frame  because  her  nose  has  gone  all</p>
<p class="calibre1">blotchy. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got something to tell you,” Harry began, but they were interrupted</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating</p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front</p>
<p class="calibre1">page  of  the   <i class="calibre3">Daily  Prophet</i>  with  a  furrowed  brow  and  Mrs.  Weasley  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she’d made as a young girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All three of them were rather giggly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you saying?” Ron asked Harry as they sat down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Later,” Harry muttered as Percy stormed in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  had  no  chance  to  speak  to  Ron  or  Hermione  in  the  chaos  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving;  they  were  too  busy  heaving  all  their  trunks  down  the  Leaky</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>Cauldron’s narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hermes,  Percy’s  screech  owl,  perched  on  top  in  their  cages.  A  small</p>
<p class="calibre1">wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  all  right,  Crookshanks,”  Hermione  cooed  through  the  wickerwork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll let you out on the train.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You won’t,” snapped Ron. “What about poor Scabbers, eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was</p>
<p class="calibre1">curled up in his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck</p>
<p class="calibre1">his head inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re here,” he said. “Harry, come on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the first of two old-fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In  you  get,  Harry,”  said  Mr.  Weasley,  glancing  up  and  down  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crowded street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, and, to Ron’s disgust, Percy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The journey to King’s Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  company  car  certainly  couldn’t  have  managed.  They  reached  King’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cross  with  twenty  minutes  to  spare;  the  Ministry  drivers  found  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving</p>
<p class="calibre1">line at the traffic lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry’s elbow all the way into the station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right  then,”  he  said,  glancing  around  them.  “Let’s  do  this  in  pairs,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">there are so many of us. I’ll go through first with Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pushing Harry’s trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity 125</p>
<p class="calibre1">that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  moment,  they  had  fallen  sideways  through  the  solid  metal  onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">platform  nine  and  three-quarters  and  looked  up  to  see  the  Hogwarts</p>
<p class="calibre1">Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with</p>
<p class="calibre1">witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>Percy  and  Ginny  suddenly  appeared  behind  Harry.  They  were  panting</p>
<p class="calibre1">and had apparently taken the barrier at a run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,  there’s  Penelope!”  said  Percy,  smoothing  his  hair  and  going  pink</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.  Ginny  caught  Harry’s  eye,  and  they  both  turned  away  to  hide  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his shiny badge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them, Harry and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  led  the  way  to  the  end  of  the  train,  past  packed  compartments,  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">carriage  that  looked  quite  empty.  They  loaded  the  trunks  onto  it,  stowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage rack, then went back outside to say</p>
<p class="calibre1">good-bye to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally, Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was embarrassed, but really quite pleased, when she gave him an extra</p>
<p class="calibre1">hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do  take  care,  won’t  you,  Harry?”  she  said  as  she  straightened  up,  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes oddly bright. Then she opened her enormous handbag and said, “I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">made you all sandwiches. … Here you are, Ron … no, they’re not corned</p>
<p class="calibre1">beef. … Fred? Where’s Fred? Here you are, dear. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  jerked  his  head  toward  a  pillar,  and  Harry  followed  him  behind  it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving the others crowded around Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  something  I’ve  got  to  tell  you  before  you  leave  —”  said  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley, in a tense voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry. “I already know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know? How could you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  —  er  —  I  heard  you  and  Mrs.  Weasley  talking  last  night.  I  couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">help hearing,” Harry added quickly. “Sorry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s  not  the  way  I’d  have  chosen  for  you  to  find  out,”  said  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley, looking anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No  —  honestly,  it’s  okay.  This  way,  you  haven’t  broken  your  word  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge and I know what’s going on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you must be very scared —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. “<i class="calibre3">Really, </i>” he added, because Mr. Weasley</p>
<p class="calibre1">was looking disbelieving. “I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>“Harry, I knew you were, well, made of stronger stuff than Fudge seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">to think, and I’m obviously pleased that you’re not scared, but —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, who was now shepherding the rest onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the train. “Arthur, what are you doing? It’s about to go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s coming, Molly!” said Mr. Weasley but he turned back to Harry and</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice. “Listen, I want you to give</p>
<p class="calibre1">me your word —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— that I’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle?” said Harry gloomily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not  entirely,”  said  Mr.  Weasley,  who  looked  more  serious  than  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">had ever seen him. “Harry, swear to me you won’t go  <i class="calibre3">looking</i> for Black.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared. “What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a loud whistle. Guards were walking along the train, slamming</p>
<p class="calibre1">all the doors shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more quickly still, “that</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever happens —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why  would  I  go  looking  for  someone  I  know  wants  to  kill  me?”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry blankly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Swear to me that whatever you might hear —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steam was billowing from the train; it had started to move. Harry ran to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the compartment door and Ron threw it open and stood back to let him on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until</p>
<p class="calibre1">the train turned a corner and blocked them from view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need to talk to you in private,” Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the train picked up speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go away, Ginny,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, that’s nice,” said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  set  off  down  the  corridor,  looking  for  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  usually  reserved  for  students  and  they  had  never  seen  an  adult  there</p>
<p class="calibre1">before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard’s robes that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  darned  in  several  places.  He  looked  ill  and  exhausted.  Though</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door</p>
<p class="calibre1">shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How d’you know that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">head,  where  there  was  a  small,  battered  case  held  together  with  a  large</p>
<p class="calibre1">quantity  of  neatly  knotted  string.  The  name   <i class="calibre3">Professor  R.  J.  Lupin</i>  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">stamped across one corner in peeling letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonder  what  he  teaches?”  said  Ron,  frowning  at  Professor  Lupin’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">pallid profile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  had  already  had  two  Defense  Against  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark  Arts  teachers,  both  of  whom  had  lasted  only  one  year.  There  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">rumors that the job was jinxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good</p>
<p class="calibre1">hex  would  finish  him  off,  doesn’t  he?  Anyway  …”  He  turned  to  Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you going to tell us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  explained  all  about  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Weasley’s  argument  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. When he’d finished, Ron looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">thunderstruck,  and  Hermione  had  her  hands  over  her  mouth.  She  finally</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowered them to say, “Sirius Black escaped to come after  <i class="calibre3">you</i>? Oh, Harry …</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ll have to be really, really careful. Don’t go looking for trouble, Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  go  looking  for  trouble,”  said  Harry,  nettled.  “Trouble  usually</p>
<p class="calibre1">finds  <i class="calibre3">me. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants</p>
<p class="calibre1">to kill him?” said Ron shakily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No  one  knows  how  he  got  out  of  Azkaban,”  said  Ron  uncomfortably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one’s ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But they’ll catch him, won’t they?” said Hermione earnestly. “I mean, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ve got all the Muggles looking out for him too. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that noise?” said Ron suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. They looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">all around the compartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>“It’s coming from your trunk, Harry,” said Ron, standing up and reaching</p>
<p class="calibre1">into  the  luggage  rack.  A  moment  later  he  had  pulled  the  Pocket</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sneakoscope out from between Harry’s robes. It was spinning very fast in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the palm of Ron’s hand and glowing brilliantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is  that  a   <i class="calibre3">Sneakoscope</i>?”  said  Hermione  interestedly,  standing  up  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">better look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah … mind you, it’s a very cheap one,” Ron said. “It went haywire</p>
<p class="calibre1">just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to send it to Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were  you  doing  anything  untrustworthy  at  the  time?”  said  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrewdly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!  Well  …  I  wasn’t  supposed  to  be  using  Errol.  You  know  he’s  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">really up to long journeys … but how else was I supposed to get Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">present to him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled</p>
<p class="calibre1">piercingly, “or it’ll wake him up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks, which deadened the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron, sitting back down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They  sell  that  sort  of  thing  in  Dervish  and  Banges,  magical  instruments</p>
<p class="calibre1">and stuff. Fred and George told me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know much about Hogsmeade?” asked Hermione keenly. “I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">read it’s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I think it is,” said Ron in an offhand sort of way, “but that’s not</p>
<p class="calibre1">why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honeydukes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  this  sweetshop,”  said  Ron,  a  dreamy  look  coming  over  his  face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“where they’ve got  <i class="calibre3">everything. …</i> Pepper Imps — they make you smoke at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mouth — and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted</p>
<p class="calibre1">cream,  and  really  excellent  sugar  quills,  which  you  can  suck  in  class  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">just look like you’re thinking what to write next —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  Hogsmeade’s  a  very  interesting  place,  isn’t  it?”  Hermione  pressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  eagerly.  “In   <i class="calibre3">Sites  of  Historical  Sorcery</i>  it  says  the  inn  was  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">headquarters  for  the  1612  goblin  rebellion,  and  the  Shrieking  Shack’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground while you’re sucking them,” said Ron, who was plainly not listening</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>to a word Hermione was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked around at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Won’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Spect it will,” said Harry heavily. “You’ll have to tell me when you’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">found out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  can’t  go.  The  Dursleys  didn’t  sign  my  permission  form,  and  Fudge</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked horrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">You’re not allowed to come</i>? But — no way — McGonagall or someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">will give you permission —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  gave  a  hollow  laugh.  Professor  McGonagall,  head  of  Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">House, was very strict. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— or we can ask Fred and George, they know every secret passage out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the castle —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron!” said Hermione sharply. “I don’t think Harry should be sneaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of school with Black on the loose —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,  I  expect  that’s  what  McGonagall  will  say  when  I  ask  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">permission,” said Harry bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  if   <i class="calibre3">we’re</i>  with  him,”  said  Ron  spiritedly  to  Hermione,  “Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t dare —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  Ron,  don’t  talk  rubbish,”  snapped  Hermione.  “Black’s  already</p>
<p class="calibre1">murdered  a  whole  bunch  of  people  in  the  middle  of  a  crowded  street.  Do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  really  think  he’s  going  to  worry  about  attacking  Harry  just  because</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">we’re</i> there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks’s basket as she spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  let  that  thing  out!”  Ron  said,  but  too  late;  Crookshanks  leapt</p>
<p class="calibre1">lightly  from  the  basket,  stretched,  yawned,  and  sprang  onto  Ron’s  knees; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  lump  in  Ron’s  pocket  trembled  and  he  shoved  Crookshanks  angrily</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get out of here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, don’t!” said Hermione angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  was  about  to  answer  back  when  Professor  Lupin  stirred.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched him apprehensively, but he simply turned his head the other way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth slightly open, and slept on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window  became  wilder  and  darker  while  the  clouds  overhead  thickened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>People  were  chasing  backward  and  forward  past  the  door  of  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartment. Crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat, his squashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">face turned toward Ron, his yellow eyes on Ron’s top pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  one  o’clock,  the  plump  witch  with  the  food  cart  arrived  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartment door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you think we should wake him up?” Ron asked awkwardly, nodding</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward Professor Lupin. “He looks like he could do with some food.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — Professor?” she said. “Excuse me — Professor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn’t move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry, dear,” said the witch as she handed Harry a large stack of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cauldron Cakes. “If he’s hungry when he wakes, I’ll be up front with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">driver.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  suppose  he   <i class="calibre3">is</i>  asleep?”  said  Ron  quietly  as  the  witch  slid  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartment door closed. “I mean — he hasn’t died, has he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, he’s breathing,” whispered Hermione, taking the Cauldron Cake</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry passed her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He might not be very good company, but Professor Lupin’s presence in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their compartment had its uses. Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">blurring  the  rolling  hills  outside  the  window,  they  heard  footsteps  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corridor  again,  and  their  three  least  favorite  people  appeared  at  the  door:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since they had met on</p>
<p class="calibre1">their very first train journey to Hogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sneering  face,  was  in  Slytherin  House;  he  played  Seeker  on  the  Slytherin</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quidditch  team,  the  same  position  that  Harry  played  on  the  Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">team. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They were</p>
<p class="calibre1">both  wide  and  musclely;  Crabbe  was  taller,  with  a  pudding-bowl  haircut</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  a  very  thick  neck;  Goyle  had  short,  bristly  hair  and  long,  gorilla-ish</p>
<p class="calibre1">arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open</p>
<p class="calibre1">the compartment door. “Potty and the Weasel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  heard  your  father  finally  got  his  hands  on  some  gold  this  summer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley,” said Malfoy. “Did your mother die of shock?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks’s basket to the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin gave a snort. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>“Who’s  that?”  said  Malfoy,  taking  an  automatic  step  backward  as  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">spotted Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hold Ron back. “What were you saying, Malfoy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy’s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn’t fool enough to pick a fight right</p>
<p class="calibre1">under a teacher’s nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon,”  he  muttered  resentfully  to  Crabbe  and  Goyle,  and  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,” he said angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I’m going to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">hold of his head and —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron made a violent gesture in midair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron,” hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, “be  <i class="calibre3">careful</i> …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were</p>
<p class="calibre1">now  a  solid,  shimmering  gray,  which  gradually  darkened  until  lanterns</p>
<p class="calibre1">flickered  into  life  all  along  the  corridors  and  over  the  luggage  racks.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">train rattled, the rain hammered, the wind roared, but still, Professor Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">slept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  must  be  nearly  there,”  said  Ron,  leaning  forward  to  look  past</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin at the now completely black window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,” said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">to try and see outside. “I’m starving. I want to get to the feast. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t be there yet,” said Hermione, checking her watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So why’re we stopping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  who  was  nearest  the  door,  got  up  to  look  into  the  corridor.  All</p>
<p class="calibre1">along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  train  came  to  a  stop  with  a  jolt,  and  distant  thuds  and  bangs  told</p>
<p class="calibre1">them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning, all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on?” said Ron’s voice from behind Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch!” gasped Hermione. “Ron, that was my foot!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt his way back to his seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>“D’you think we’ve broken down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  squeaking  sound,  and  Harry  saw  the  dim  black  outline  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  something  moving  out  there,”  Ron  said.  “I  think  people  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming aboard. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry — d’you know what’s going on? — Ouch — sorry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hullo,  Neville,”  said  Harry,  feeling  around  in  the  dark  and  pulling</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville up by his cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry? Is that you? What’s happening?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No idea — sit down —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on,” came Hermione’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and then a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thud and two loud squeals of pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s  <i class="calibre3">that</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ginny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was looking for Ron —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come in and sit down —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not here!” said Harry hurriedly. “<i class="calibre3">I’m</i> here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch!” said Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quiet!” said a hoarse voice suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Lupin  appeared  to  have  woken  up  at  last.  Harry  could  hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">movements in his corner. None of them spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  soft,  crackling  noise,  and  a  shivering  light  filled  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and wary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay  where  you  are,”  he  said  in  the  same  hoarse  voice,  and  he  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand,  was  a  cloaked  figure  that  towered  to  the  ceiling.  Its  face  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely  hidden  beneath  its  hood.  Harry’s  eyes  darted  downward,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cloak  and  it  was  glistening,  grayish,  slimy-looking,  and  scabbed,  like</p>
<p class="calibre1">something dead that had decayed in water. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature beneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cloak  sensed  Harry’s  gaze,  the  hand  was  suddenly  withdrawn  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">folds of its black cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rattling  breath,  as  though  it  were  trying  to  suck  something  more  than  air</p>
<p class="calibre1">from its surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside his very heart. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn’t see. He was drowning</p>
<p class="calibre1">in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was being</p>
<p class="calibre1">dragged downward, the roaring growing louder …</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, pleading</p>
<p class="calibre1">screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t … a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside him —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! Harry! Are you all right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone was slapping his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W — what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking  —  the  Hogwarts  Express  was  moving  again  and  the  lights  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hermione  were  kneeling  next  to  him,  and  above  them  he  could  see</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up</p>
<p class="calibre1">his hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you okay?” Ron asked nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”  said  Harry,  looking  quickly  toward  the  door.  The  hooded</p>
<p class="calibre1">creature had vanished. “What happened? Where’s that — that thing? Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">screamed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one screamed,” said Ron, more nervously still. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">back at him, both very pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I heard screaming —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  loud  snap  made  them  all  jump.  Professor  Lupin  was  breaking  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous slab of chocolate into pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. “Eat it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’ll help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took the chocolate but didn’t eat it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was that thing?” he asked Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A  dementor,”  said  Lupin,  who  was  now  giving  chocolate  to  everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">else. “One of the dementors of Azkaban.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone  stared  at  him.  Professor  Lupin  crumpled  up  the  empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eat,”  he  repeated.  “It’ll  help.  I  need  to  speak  to  the  driver,  excuse  me</p>
<p class="calibre1">…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are  you  sure  you’re  okay,  Harry?”  said  Hermione,  watching  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  get  it.  …  What  happened?”  said  Harry,  wiping  more  sweat  off</p>
<p class="calibre1">his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well — that thing — the dementor — stood there and looked around (I</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean, I think it did, I couldn’t see its face) — and you — you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  thought  you  were  having  a  fit  or  something,”  said  Ron,  who  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked scared. “You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started</p>
<p class="calibre1">twitching —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  Professor  Lupin  stepped  over  you,  and  walked  toward  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor, and pulled out his wand,” said Hermione, “and he said, ‘None of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us  is  hiding  Sirius  Black  under  our  cloaks.  Go.’  But  the  dementor  didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">move,  so  Lupin  muttered  something,  and  a  silvery  thing  shot  out  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was horrible,” said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. “Did you feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">how cold it got when it came in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I felt weird,” said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. “Like I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">never be cheerful again. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny,  who  was  huddled  in  her  corner  looking  nearly  as  bad  as  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt,  gave  a  small  sob;  Hermione  went  over  and  put  a  comforting  arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">around her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>“But didn’t any of you — fall off your seats?” said Harry awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. “Ginny was shaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">like mad, though. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  didn’t  understand.  He  felt  weak  and  shivery,  as  though  he  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">recovering  from  a  bad  bout  of  flu;  he  also  felt  the  beginnings  of  shame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and said, with a small smile, “I haven’t poisoned that chocolate, you know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the tips of his fingers and toes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,” said Professor Lupin. “Are you all</p>
<p class="calibre1">right, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,” he muttered, embarrassed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get  outside;  owls  hooted,  cats  meowed,  and  Neville’s  pet  toad  croaked</p>
<p class="calibre1">loudly  from  under  his  hat.  It  was  freezing  on  the  tiny  platform;  rain  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">driving down in icy sheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Firs’ years this way!” called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned  and  saw  the  gigantic  outline  of  Hagrid  at  the  other  end  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">platform,  beckoning  the  terrified-looking  new  students  forward  for  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">traditional journey across the lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All righ’, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">waved  at  him,  but  had  no  chance  to  speak  to  him  because  the  mass  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  around  them  was  shunting  them  away  along  the  platform.  Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and</p>
<p class="calibre1">out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  remaining  students,  each  pulled,  Harry  could  only  assume,  by  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible  horse,  because  when  they  climbed  inside  and  shut  the  door,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him sideways, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as though frightened he might collapse again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates, </p>
<p class="calibre1">flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars, Harry saw two more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either side. A wave of cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat</p>
<p class="calibre1">and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates. The carriage picked up</p>
<p class="calibre1">speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer. At</p>
<p class="calibre1">last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron got out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You   <i class="calibre3">fainted, </i>  Potter?  Is  Longbottom  telling  the  truth?  You  actually</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">fainted</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry’s way up the stone steps</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shove off, Malfoy,” said Ron, whose jaw was clenched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you faint as well, Weasley?” said Malfoy loudly. “Did the scary old</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor frighten you too, Weasley?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there a problem?” said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the next carriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches</p>
<p class="calibre1">on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice, he said, “Oh, no — er —  <i class="calibre3">Professor, </i>” then he smirked at Crabbe and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front</p>
<p class="calibre1">doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was</p>
<p class="calibre1">black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, “Potter! Granger! I want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see you both!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  and  Hermione  turned  around,  surprised.  Professor  McGonagall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads of the crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore her hair in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry fought</p>
<p class="calibre1">his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had</p>
<p class="calibre1">a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my office,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she told them. “Move along there, Weasley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>Ron  stared  as   Professor  McGonagall  ushered  Harry  and Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  McGonagall  motioned  Harry  and  Hermione  to  sit  down.  She</p>
<p class="calibre1">settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, “Professor Lupin sent an</p>
<p class="calibre1">owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  felt  himself  going  red  in  the  face.  It  was  bad  enough  that  he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all this fuss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  it’s  you,  is  it?”  said  Madam  Pomfrey,  ignoring  this  and  bending</p>
<p class="calibre1">down  to  stare  closely  at  him.  “I  suppose  you’ve  been  doing  something</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was a dementor, Poppy,” said Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  exchanged  a  dark  look,  and  Madam  Pomfrey  clucked</p>
<p class="calibre1">disapprovingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Setting dementors around a school,” she muttered, pushing back Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair and feeling his forehead. “He won’t be the last one who collapses. Yes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they have on people</p>
<p class="calibre1">who are already delicate —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not delicate!” said Harry crossly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of  course  you’re  not,”  said  Madam  Pomfrey  absentmindedly,  now</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking his pulse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  does  he  need?”  said  Professor  McGonagall  crisply.  “Bed  rest? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  <i class="calibre3">fine</i>!” said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  he  should  have  some  chocolate,  at  the  very  least,”  said  Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry’s eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve already had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin gave me some. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave it to all of us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So we’ve finally got</p>
<p class="calibre1">a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are  you  sure  you  feel  all  right,  Potter?”  Professor  McGonagall  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>“<i class="calibre3">Yes</i>,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very  well.  Kindly  wait  outside  while  I  have  a  quick  word  with  Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Granger  about  her  course  schedule,  then  we  can  go  down  to  the  feast</p>
<p class="calibre1">together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hospital wing, muttering to herself. He had to wait only a few minutes; then</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  emerged  looking  very  happy  about  something,  followed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the</p>
<p class="calibre1">marble staircase to the Great Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  sea  of  pointed  black  hats;  each  of  the  long  House  tables  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">lined  with  students,  their  faces  glimmering  by  the  light  of  thousands  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">candles, which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor Flitwick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  was  a  tiny  little  wizard  with  a  shock  of  white  hair,  was  carrying  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  students  at  Hogwarts  were  sorted  into  Houses  by  trying  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sorting  Hat,  which  shouted  out  the  House  they  were  best  suited  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Gryffindor,  Ravenclaw,  Hufflepuff,  or  Slytherin).  Professor  McGonagall</p>
<p class="calibre1">strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">table.  People  looked  around  at  them  as  they  passed  along  the  back  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story of his collapsing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front of the dementor traveled that fast? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them</p>
<p class="calibre1">seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was all that about?” he muttered to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood up to speak, and he broke off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Dumbledore,  though  very  old,  always  gave  an  impression  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard, half-moon</p>
<p class="calibre1">spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He was often described as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn’t why Harry respected him. You</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t  help  trusting  Albus  Dumbledore,  and  as  Harry  watched  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the first time since</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dementor had entered the train compartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome!” said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out of the way</p>
<p class="calibre1">before you become befuddled by our excellent feast. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, “As you will all be aware</p>
<p class="calibre1">after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing</p>
<p class="calibre1">host  to  some  of  the  dementors  of  Azkaban,  who  are  here  on  Ministry  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  paused,  and  Harry  remembered  what  Mr.  Weasley  had  said  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They  are  stationed  at  every  entrance  to  the  grounds,”  Dumbledore</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued, “and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  leave  school  without  permission.  Dementors  are  not  to  be  fooled  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">tricks  or  disguises  —  or  even  Invisibility  Cloaks,”  he  added  blandly,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron glanced at each other. “It is not in the nature of a dementor</p>
<p class="calibre1">to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new</p>
<p class="calibre1">Head  Boy  and  Girl,  to  make  sure  that  no  student  runs  afoul  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest</p>
<p class="calibre1">again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On a happier note,” he continued, “I am pleased to welcome two new</p>
<p class="calibre1">teachers to our ranks this year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First,  Professor  Lupin,  who  has  kindly  consented  to  fill  the  post  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  some  scattered,  rather  unenthusiastic  applause.  Only  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next</p>
<p class="calibre1">to all the other teachers in their best robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense</p>
<p class="calibre1">Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  expression  twisting  his  thin,  sallow  face.  It  was  beyond  anger:  it  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">wore every time he set eyes on Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As  to  our  second  new  appointment,”  Dumbledore  continued  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lukewarm applause for Professor Lupin died away. “Well, I am sorry to tell</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>you  that  Professor  Kettleburn,  our  Care  of  Magical  Creatures  teacher, </p>
<p class="calibre1">retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining</p>
<p class="calibre1">limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none</p>
<p class="calibre1">other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in</p>
<p class="calibre1">addition to his gamekeeping duties.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  stared  at  one  another,  stunned.  Then  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular.  Harry  leaned  forward  to  see  Hagrid,  who  was  ruby-red  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tangle of his black beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  should’ve  known!”  Ron  roared,  pounding  the  table.  “Who  else</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have assigned us a biting book?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  were  the  last  to  stop  clapping,  and  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Dumbledore  started  speaking  again,  they  saw  that  Hagrid  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiping his eyes on the tablecloth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  I  think  that’s  everything  of  importance,”  said  Dumbledore.  “Let</p>
<p class="calibre1">the feast begin!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and</p>
<p class="calibre1">drink.  Harry,  suddenly  ravenous,  helped  himself  to  everything  he  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach and began to eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the clatter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were eager for it</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  finish  so  that  they  could  talk  to  Hagrid.  They  knew  how  much  being</p>
<p class="calibre1">made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn’t a fully qualified wizard; </p>
<p class="calibre1">he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not</p>
<p class="calibre1">committed.  It  had  been  Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  who  had  cleared</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s name last year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go to bed, and they got their chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congratulations,  Hagrid!”  Hermione  squealed  as  they  reached  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">teachers’ table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All  down  ter  you  three,”  said  Hagrid,  wiping  his  shining  face  on  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">napkin as he looked up at them. “Can’ believe it … great man, Dumbledore</p>
<p class="calibre1">… came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn said he’d had</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough. … It’s what I always wanted. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall shooed them away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  joined  the  Gryffindors  streaming  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">marble  staircase  and,  very  tired  now,  along  more  corridors,  up  more  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower. A large portrait of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fat lady in a pink dress asked them, “Password?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coming through, coming through!” Percy called from behind the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The new password’s ‘Fortuna Major’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh  no,”  said  Neville  Longbottom  sadly.  He  always  had  trouble</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembering the passwords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through  the  portrait  hole  and  across  the  common  room,  the  girls  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">boys divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  no  thought  in  his  head  except  how  glad  he  was  to  be  back.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster beds, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a><img src="index-74_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Talons and Tea Leaves</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next  day,  the  first  thing  they  saw  was  Draco  Malfoy,  who  seemed  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertaining  a  large  group  of  Slytherins  with  a  very  funny  story.  As  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a roar of laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ignore him,” said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. “Just ignore</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, it’s not worth it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, Potter!” shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face like</p>
<p class="calibre1">a pug. “Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter!  <i class="calibre3">Woooooooo</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  dropped  into  a  seat  at  the  Gryffindor  table,  next  to  George</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New  third-year  course  schedules,”  said  George,  passing  them  over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s up with you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting down on George’s other side and glaring over</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the Slytherin table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">George  looked  up  in  time  to  see  Malfoy  pretending  to  faint  with  terror</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That little git,” he said calmly. “He wasn’t so cocky last night when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors  were  down  at  our  end  of  the  train.  Came  running  into  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartment, didn’t he, Fred?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>“Nearly wet himself,” said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wasn’t too happy myself,” said George. “They’re horrible things, those</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sort of freeze your insides, don’t they?” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You didn’t pass out, though, did you?” said Harry in a low voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forget it, Harry,” said George bracingly. “Dad had to go out to Azkaban</p>
<p class="calibre1">one  time,  remember,  Fred?  And  he  said  it  was  the  worst  place  he’d  ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">been, he came back all weak and shaking. … They suck the happiness out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,  we’ll  see  how  happy  Malfoy  looks  after  our  first  Quidditch</p>
<p class="calibre1">match,”  said  Fred.  “Gryffindor  versus  Slytherin,  first  game  of  the  season, </p>
<p class="calibre1">remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  only  time  Harry  and  Malfoy  had  faced  each  other  in  a  Quidditch</p>
<p class="calibre1">match,  Malfoy  had  definitely  come  off  worse.  Feeling  slightly  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was examining her new schedule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,” she said happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, “they’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">messed  up  your  schedule.  Look  —  they’ve  got  you  down  for  about  ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjects a day. There isn’t enough  <i class="calibre3">time. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll manage. I’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  look,”  said  Ron,  laughing,  “see  this  morning?  Nine  o’clock, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divination.  And  underneath,  nine  o’clock,  Muggle  Studies.  And”  —  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned  closer  to  the  schedule,  disbelieving  —  “<i class="calibre3">look</i>  —  underneath  that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arithmancy,  <i class="calibre3">nine o’clock. </i>  I  mean,  I  know  you’re  good,  Hermione,  but  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">one’s  <i class="calibre3">that</i> good. How’re you supposed to be in three classes at once?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  be  silly,”  said  Hermione  shortly.  “Of  course  I  won’t  be  in  three</p>
<p class="calibre1">classes at once.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pass the marmalade,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  Ron,  what’s  it  to  you  if  my  schedule’s  a  bit  full?”  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped. “I told you, I’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  then,  Hagrid  entered  the  Great  Hall.  He  was  wearing  his  long</p>
<p class="calibre1">moleskin  overcoat  and  was  absentmindedly  swinging  a  dead  polecat  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">one enormous hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>“All righ’?” he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the staff table. “Yer in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my firs’ ever lesson! Right after lunch! Bin up since five gettin’ everythin’</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready. … Hope it’s okay. … Me, a teacher … hones’ly. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  grinned  broadly  at  them  and  headed  off  to  the  staff  table,  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">swinging the polecat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonder  what  he’s  been  getting  ready?”  said  Ron,  a  note  of  anxiety  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hall  was  starting  to  empty  as  people  headed  off  toward  their  first</p>
<p class="calibre1">lesson. Ron checked his course schedule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d better go, look, Divination’s at the top of North Tower. It’ll take us</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten minutes to get there. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye to Fred and George, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  walked  back  through  the  hall.  As  they  passed  the  Slytherin  table, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit. The shouts of laughter</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed Harry into the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one. Two years</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  Hogwarts  hadn’t  taught  them  everything  about  the  castle,  and  they  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">never been inside North Tower before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  —  got  —  to  —  be  —  a  —  shortcut,”  Ron  panted  as  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbed their seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  there  was  nothing  but  a  large  painting  of  a  bare  stretch  of  grass</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanging on the stone wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it’s this way,” said Hermione, peering down the empty passage to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t be,” said Ron. “That’s south, look, you can see a bit of the lake</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the window …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  watching  the  painting.  A  fat,  dapple-gray  pony  had  just</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly. Harry was used to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to</p>
<p class="calibre1">visit  one  another,  but  he  always  enjoyed  watching  it.  A  moment  later,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">short, squat knight in a suit of armor clanked into the picture after his pony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the look of the grass stains on his metal knees, he had just fallen off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha!” he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “What villains are</p>
<p class="calibre1">these,  that  trespass  upon  my  private  lands!  Come  to  scorn  at  my  fall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">its  scabbard  and  began  brandishing  it  violently,  hopping  up  and  down  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made</p>
<p class="calibre1">him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you all right?” said Harry, moving closer to the picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his</p>
<p class="calibre1">might, he couldn’t get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back down onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,” said Harry, taking advantage of the knight’s exhaustion, “we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking for the North Tower. You don’t know the way, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A quest!” The knight’s rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his feet and shouted, “Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our</p>
<p class="calibre1">goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat</p>
<p class="calibre1">pony,  gave  up,  and  cried,  “On  foot  then,  good  sirs  and  gentle  lady!  On! </p>
<p class="calibre1">On!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  he  ran,  clanking  loudly,  into  the  left  side  of  the  frame  and  out  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  hurried  after  him  along  the  corridor,  following  the  sound  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">armor.  Every  now  and  then  they  spotted  him  running  through  a  picture</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the knight, and they</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw  him  reappear  in  front  of  an  alarmed  group  of  women  in  crinolines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Puffing  loudly,  Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  climbed  the  tightly  spiraling</p>
<p class="calibre1">steps,  getting  dizzier  and  dizzier,  until  at  last  they  heard  the  murmur  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Farewell!”  cried  the  knight,  popping  his  head  into  a  painting  of  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinister-looking monks. “Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have</p>
<p class="calibre1">need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,  we’ll  call  you,”  muttered  Ron  as  the  knight  disappeared,  “if  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever need someone mental.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  of  the  class  was  already  assembled.  There  were  no  doors  off  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>“  ‘Sibyll  Trelawney,  Divination  teacher,’  ”  Harry  read.  “How’re  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed to get up there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">silvery ladder descended right at Harry’s feet. Everyone got quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After you,” said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  emerged  into  the  strangest-looking  classroom  he  had  ever  seen.  In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact,  it  didn’t  look  like  a  classroom  at  all,  more  like  a  cross  between</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone’s  attic  and  an  old-fashioned  tea  shop.  At  least  twenty  small, </p>
<p class="calibre1">circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  fat  little  poufs.  Everything  was  lit  with  a  dim,  crimson  light;  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped</p>
<p class="calibre1">with dark red scarves. It was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning</p>
<p class="calibre1">under  the  crowded  mantelpiece  was  giving  off  a  heavy,  sickly  sort  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the</p>
<p class="calibre1">circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of candles, </p>
<p class="calibre1">many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge array of teacups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron appeared at Harry’s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">talking in whispers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is she?” Ron said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome,” it said. “How nice to see you in the physical world at last.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her</p>
<p class="calibre1">large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung</p>
<p class="calibre1">around  her  spindly  neck,  and  her  arms  and  hands  were  encrusted  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">bangles and rings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit,  my  children,  sit,”  she  said,  and  they  all  climbed  awkwardly  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">armchairs  or  sank  onto  poufs.  Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  sat  themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the same round table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome  to  Divination,”  said  Professor  Trelawney,  who  had  seated</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself  in  a  winged  armchair  in  front  of  the  fire.  “My  name  is  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney.  You  may  not  have  seen  me  before.  I  find  that  descending  too</p>
<p class="calibre1">often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody  said  anything  to  this  extraordinary  pronouncement.  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney  delicately  rearranged  her  shawl  and  continued,  “So  you  have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>chosen  to  study  Divination,  the  most  difficult  of  all  magical  arts.  I  must</p>
<p class="calibre1">warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I</p>
<p class="calibre1">will be able to teach you. Books can take you only so far in this field. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked  startled  at  the  news  that  books  wouldn’t  be  much  help  in  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud</p>
<p class="calibre1">bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">veiled  mysteries  of  the  future,”  Professor  Trelawney  went  on,  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous,  gleaming  eyes  moving  from  face  to  nervous  face.  “It  is  a  Gift</p>
<p class="calibre1">granted to few. You, boy,” she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled</p>
<p class="calibre1">off his pouf. “Is your grandmother well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think so,” said Neville tremulously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you, dear,” said Professor Trelawney, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">firelight  glinting  on  her  long  emerald  earrings.  Neville  gulped.  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney  continued  placidly.  “We  will  be  covering  the  basic  methods  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,” she shot</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly at Parvati Patil, “beware a red-haired man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her, and edged</p>
<p class="calibre1">her chair away from him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the second term,” Professor Trelawney went on, “we shall progress to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  crystal  ball  —  if  we  have  finished  with  fire  omens,  that  is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">us forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  very  tense  silence  followed  this  pronouncement,  but  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney seemed unaware of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  wonder,  dear,”  she  said  to  Lavender  Brown,  who  was  nearest  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrank back in her chair, “if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading — it will</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lavender trembled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, </p>
<p class="calibre1">come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain</p>
<p class="calibre1">away,  then  give  your  cup  to  your  partner  to  read.  You  will  interpret  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">patterns  using  pages  five  and  six  of   <i class="calibre3">Unfogging  the  Future. </i>  I  shall  move</p>
<p class="calibre1">among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and dear” — she caught Neville by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  arm  as  he  made  to  stand  up  —  “after  you’ve  broken  your  first  cup, </p>
<p class="calibre1">would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I’m rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">attached to the pink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure  enough,  Neville  had  no  sooner  reached  the  shelf  of  teacups  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to him</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding a dustpan and brush and said, “One of the blue ones, then, dear, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you wouldn’t mind … thank you. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their</p>
<p class="calibre1">table  and  tried  to  drink  the  scalding  tea  quickly.  They  swilled  the  dregs</p>
<p class="calibre1">around  as  Professor  Trelawney  had  instructed,  then  drained  the  cups  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">swapped over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What can you see in mine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A load of soggy brown stuff,” said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Broaden  your  minds,  my  dears,  and  allow  your  eyes  to  see  past  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mundane!” Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tried to pull himself together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right, you’ve got a crooked sort of cross …” He consulted  <i class="calibre3">Unfogging</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">the Future. </i> “That means you’re going to have ‘trials and suffering’ — sorry</p>
<p class="calibre1">about that — but there’s a thing that could be the sun … hang on … that</p>
<p class="calibre1">means ‘great happiness’ … so you’re going to suffer but be very happy. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,” said Ron, and they both</p>
<p class="calibre1">had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My turn …” Ron peered into Harry’s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with</p>
<p class="calibre1">effort.  “There’s  a  blob  a  bit  like  a  bowler  hat,”  he  said.  “Maybe  you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to work for the Ministry of Magic. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned the teacup the other way up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But this way it looks more like an acorn. … What’s that?” He scanned</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  copy  of   <i class="calibre3">Unfogging  the  Future. </i>  “  ‘A  windfall,  unexpected  gold.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Excellent, you can lend me some … and there’s a thing here,” he turned the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>cup again, “that looks like an animal … yeah, if that was its head … it looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a hippo … no, a sheep …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over</p>
<p class="calibre1">and snatching Harry’s cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Trelawney  was  staring  into  the  teacup,  rotating  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">counterclockwise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The falcon … my dear, you have a deadly enemy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But everyone knows  <i class="calibre3">that, </i>” said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney stared at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  they  do,”  said  Hermione.  “Everybody  knows  about  Harry  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">You-Know-Who.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  and  Ron  stared  at  her  with  a  mixture  of  amazement  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">admiration.  They  had  never  heard  Hermione  speak  to  a  teacher  like  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">before. Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Harry’s cup again and continued to turn it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The club … an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought that was a bowler hat,” said Ron sheepishly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The skull … danger in your path, my dear. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  another  tinkle  of  breaking  china;  Neville  had  smashed  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her glittering</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand at her heart and her eyes closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear boy … my poor, dear boy … no … it is kinder not to say … no</p>
<p class="calibre1">… don’t ask me. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it, Professor?” said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron’s table, pressing</p>
<p class="calibre1">close to Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at Harry’s cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  dear,”  Professor  Trelawney’s  huge  eyes  opened  dramatically,  “you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have the Grim.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The what?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  could  tell  that  he  wasn’t  the  only  one  who  didn’t  understand;  Dean</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Grim, my dear, the Grim!” cried Professor Trelawney, who looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">shocked that Harry hadn’t understood. “The giant, spectral dog that haunts</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen — the worst omen — of  <i class="calibre3">death</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  stomach  lurched.  That  dog  on  the  cover  of   <i class="calibre3">Death  Omens</i>  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flourish  and  Blotts  —  the  dog  in  the  shadows  of  Magnolia  Crescent  …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lavender  Brown  clapped  her  hands  to  her  mouth  too.  Everyone  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">around to the back of Professor Trelawney’s chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I</i> don’t think it looks like a Grim,” she said flatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura</p>
<p class="calibre1">around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It looks like a Grim if you do this,” he said, with his eyes almost shut, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but it looks more like a donkey from here,” he said, leaning to the left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When  you’ve  all  finished  deciding  whether  I’m  going  to  die  or  not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  think  we  will  leave  the  lesson  here  for  today,”  said  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney in her mistiest voice. “Yes … please pack away your things. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney, packed</p>
<p class="calibre1">away  their  books,  and  closed  their  bags.  Even  Ron  was  avoiding  Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Until we meet again,” said Professor Trelawney faintly, “fair fortune be</p>
<p class="calibre1">yours. Oh, and dear” — she pointed at Neville — “you’ll be late next time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so mind you work extra-hard to catch up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney’s ladder and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  winding  stair  in  silence,  then  set  off  for  Professor  McGonagall’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that, early</p>
<p class="calibre1">as they had left Divination, they were only just in time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  chose  a  seat  right  at  the  back  of  the  room,  feeling  as  though  he</p>
