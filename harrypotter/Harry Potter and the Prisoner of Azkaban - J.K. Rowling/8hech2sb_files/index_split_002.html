<p class="calibre1">Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  looked  at  one  another.  They  had  never  seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye  to  eye  with  Hagrid  about  what  he  called  “interesting  creatures”  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  people  called  “terrifying  monsters.”  On  the  other  hand,  there  didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">seem  to  be  any  particular  harm  in  Buckbeak.  In  fact,  by  Hagrid’s  usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards, he was positively cute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll  have  to  put  up  a  good  strong  defense,  Hagrid,”  said  Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can prove Buckbeak is safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>“Won’t  make  no  diff’rence!”  sobbed  Hagrid.  “Them  Disposal  devils, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid  drew  his  finger  swiftly  across  his  throat,  then  gave  a  great  wail</p>
<p class="calibre1">and lurched forward, his face in his arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  done  more’n  enough  fer  me  already,”  groaned  Hagrid.  “Got</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough on his plate what with keepin’ them dementors outta the castle, an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius Black lurkin’ around —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to</p>
<p class="calibre1">start  berating  Hagrid  for  not  telling  him  the  truth  about  Black.  But  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so miserable and</p>
<p class="calibre1">scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, Hagrid,” he said, “you can’t give up. Hermione’s right, you just</p>
<p class="calibre1">need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  sure  I’ve  read  about  a  case  of  hippogriff-baiting,”  said  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughtfully, “where the hippogriff got off. I’ll look it up for you, Hagrid, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and see exactly what happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to</p>
<p class="calibre1">help them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — shall I make a cup of tea?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  what  my  mum  does  whenever  someone’s  upset,”  Ron  muttered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shrugging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  front  of  him,  Hagrid  blew  his  nose  on  a  handkerchief  the  size  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tablecloth  and  said,  “Yer  right.  I  can’  afford  to  go  ter  pieces.  Gotta  pull</p>
<p class="calibre1">meself together. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head on Hagrid’s knee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve  not  bin  meself  lately,”  said  Hagrid,  stroking  Fang  with  one  hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">and mopping his face with the other. “Worried abou’ Buckbeak, an’ no one</p>
<p class="calibre1">likin’ me classes —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We do like them!” lied Hermione at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, they’re great!” said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table. “Er</p>
<p class="calibre1">— how are the flobberworms?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dead,” said Hagrid gloomily. “Too much lettuce.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>“Oh no!” said Ron, his lip twitching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An’ them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an’ all,” said Hagrid, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with a sudden shudder. “Gotta walk past ’em ev’ry time I want a drink in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Three Broomsticks. ’S like bein’ back in Azkaban —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  fell  silent,  gulping  his  tea.  Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  watched  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathlessly.  They  had  never  heard  Hagrid  talk  about  his  brief  spell  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Azkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, “Is it awful in there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh’ve  no  idea,”  said  Hagrid  quietly.  “Never  bin  anywhere  like  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thought I was goin’ mad. Kep’ goin’ over horrible stuff in me mind … the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day I got expelled from Hogwarts … day me dad died … day I had ter let</p>
<p class="calibre1">Norbert go. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once</p>
<p class="calibre1">won in a game of cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while. An’ yeh can’ see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the point o’ livin’ at all. I used ter hope I’d jus’ die in me sleep. … When</p>
<p class="calibre1">they let me out, it was like bein’ born again, ev’rythin’ came floodin’ back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world. Mind, the dementors weren’t keen on</p>
<p class="calibre1">lettin’ me go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you were innocent!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid snorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think  that  matters  to  them?  They  don’  care.  Long  as  they’ve  got  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple o’ hundred humans stuck there with ’em, so they can leech all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">happiness out of ’em, they don’ give a damn who’s guilty an’ who’s not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid  went  quiet  for  a  moment,  staring  into  his  tea.  Then  he  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly,  “Thought  o’  jus’  letting  Buckbeak  go  …  tryin’  ter  make  him  fly</p>
<p class="calibre1">away  …  but  how  d’yeh  explain  ter  a  hippogriff  it’s  gotta  go  inter  hidin’? </p>
<p class="calibre1">An’ — an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law. …” He looked up at them, tears</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaking down his face again. “I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The trip to Hagrid’s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  and  Hermione  had  hoped.  Though  Harry  had  by  no  means  forgotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">about Black, he couldn’t brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creatures.  He,  Ron,  and  Hermione  went  to  the  library  the  next  day  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned  to  the  empty  common  room  laden  with  books  that  might  help</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepare  a  defense  for  Buckbeak.  The  three  of  them  sat  in  front  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>of marauding beasts, speaking occasionally when they ran across something</p>
<p class="calibre1">relevant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s something … there was a case in 1722 … but the hippogriff was</p>
<p class="calibre1">convicted — ugh, look what they did to it, that’s disgusting —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This  might  help,  look  —  a  manticore  savaged  someone  in  1296,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they let the manticore off — oh — no, that was only because everyone was</p>
<p class="calibre1">too scared to go near it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  in  the  rest  of  the  castle,  the  usual  magnificent  Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre1">decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the students</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung</p>
<p class="calibre1">along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  Great  Hall  was  filled  with  its  usual  twelve  Christmas  trees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">glittering  with  golden  stars.  A  powerful  and  delicious  smell  of  cooking</p>
<p class="calibre1">pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  Scabbers  poked  his  nose  out  of  the  shelter  of  Ron’s  pocket  to  sniff</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopefully at the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oy! Presents!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  reached  for  his  glasses  and  put  them  on,  squinting  through  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">semi-darkness  to  the  foot  of  his  bed,  where  a  small  heap  of  parcels  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another sweater from Mum … maroon  <i class="calibre3">again</i> … see if you’ve got one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  had.  Mrs.  Weasley  had  sent  him  a  scarlet  sweater  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these things</p>
<p class="calibre1">aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  that?”  said  Ron,  looking  over,  a  freshly  unwrapped  pair  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">maroon socks in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  ripped  the  parcel  open  and  gasped  as  a  magnificent,  gleaming</p>
<p class="calibre1">broomstick  rolled  out  onto  his  bedspread.  Ron  dropped  his  socks  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumped off his bed for a closer look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t believe it,” he said hoarsely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  Firebolt,  identical  to  the  dream  broom  Harry  had  gone  to  see</p>
<p class="calibre1">every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He could</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel  it  vibrating  and  let  go;  it  hung  in  midair,  unsupported,  at  exactly  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>right  height  for  him  to  mount  it.  His  eyes  moved  from  the  golden</p>
<p class="calibre1">registration  number  at  the  top  of  the  handle,  right  down  to  the  perfectly</p>
<p class="calibre1">smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who sent it to you?” said Ron in a hushed voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look and see if there’s a card,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron ripped apart the Firebolt’s wrappings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing! Blimey, who’d spend that much on you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Harry, feeling stunned, “I’m betting it wasn’t the Dursleys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I bet it was Dumbledore,” said Ron, now walking around and around the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. “He sent you the Invisibility Cloak</p>
<p class="calibre1">anonymously. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was my dad’s, though,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was just passing</p>
<p class="calibre1">it on to me. He wouldn’t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can’t go</p>
<p class="calibre1">giving students stuff like this —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s why he wouldn’t say it was from him!” said Ron. “In case some</p>
<p class="calibre1">git  like  Malfoy  said  it  was  favoritism.  Hey,  Harry”  —  Ron  gave  a  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">whoop of laughter — “<i class="calibre3">Malfoy</i>! Wait till he sees you on this! He’ll be sick as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a pig! This is an  <i class="calibre3">international</i> standard broom, this is!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t believe this,” Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  Ron  sank  onto  Harry’s  bed,  laughing  his  head  off  at  the  thought  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy. “<i class="calibre3">Who</i> — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” said Ron, controlling himself, “I know who it could’ve been —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry, now starting to laugh himself. “<i class="calibre3">Lupin</i>? Listen, if he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had this much gold, he’d be able to buy himself some new robes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,  but  he  likes  you,”  said  Ron.  “And  he  was  away  when  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nimbus got smashed, and he might’ve heard about it and decided to visit</p>
<p class="calibre1">Diagon Alley and get this for you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean, he was away?” said Harry. “He was ill when I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing in that match.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, he wasn’t in the hospital wing,” said Ron. “I was there, cleaning</p>
<p class="calibre1">out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry frowned at Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t see Lupin affording something like this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’re you two laughing about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  had  just  come  in,  wearing  her  dressing  gown  and  carrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks,  who  was  looking  very  grumpy,  with  a  string  of  tinsel  tied</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>around his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t bring him in here!” said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket. But Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t  listening.  She  dropped  Crookshanks  onto  Seamus’s  empty  bed  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  <i class="calibre3">Harry</i>! Who sent you  <i class="calibre3">that</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No idea,” said Harry. “There wasn’t a card or anything with it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the matter with you?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” said Hermione slowly, “but it’s a bit odd, isn’t it? I mean, </p>
<p class="calibre1">this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron sighed exasperatedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the best broom there is, Hermione,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So it must’ve been really expensive. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably  cost  more  than  all  the  Slytherins’  brooms  put  together,”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well … who’d send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell him they’d sent it?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who cares?” said Ron impatiently. “Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  think  anyone  should  ride  that  broom  just  yet!”  said  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrilly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron looked at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you think Harry’s going to do with it — sweep the floor?” said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed, right at Ron’s chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“GET  —  HIM  —  OUT  —  OF  —  HERE!”  Ron  bellowed  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks’s  claws  ripped  his  pajamas  and  Scabbers  attempted  a  wild</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape  over  his  shoulder.  Ron  seized  Scabbers  by  the  tail  and  aimed  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry’s bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks’s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tinny whistling was</p>
<p class="calibre1">filling  the  room.  The  Pocket  Sneakoscope  had  become  dislodged  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle Vernon’s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>“I  forgot  about  that!”  Harry  said,  bending  down  and  picking  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sneakoscope. “I never wear those socks if I can help it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Sneakoscope  whirled  and  whistled  in  his  palm.  Crookshanks  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">hissing and spitting at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d  better  take  that  cat  out  of  here,  Hermione,”  said  Ron  furiously, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting  on  Harry’s  bed  nursing  his  toe.  “Can’t  you  shut  that  thing  up?”  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks’s yellow</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  stuffed  the  Sneakoscope  back  inside  the  socks  and  threw  it  back</p>
<p class="calibre1">into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron’s stifled moans of pain</p>
<p class="calibre1">and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron’s hands. It had been a while since</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had seen him out of Ron’s pocket, and he was unpleasantly surprised</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  see  that  Scabbers,  once  so  fat,  was  now  very  skinny;  patches  of  fur</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed to have fallen out too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s not looking too good, is he?” Harry said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  stress!”  said  Ron.  “He’d  be  fine  if  that  big  stupid  furball  left  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had</p>
<p class="calibre1">said  about  rats  living  only  three  years,  couldn’t  help  feeling  that  unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">life. And despite Ron’s frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring</p>
<p class="calibre1">and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas  spirit  was  definitely  thin  on  the  ground  in  the  Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">common  room  that  morning.  Hermione  had  shut  Crookshanks  in  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was still</p>
<p class="calibre1">fuming about Crookshanks’s fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying  to  make  them  talk  to  each  other  and  devoted  himself  to  examining</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Firebolt,  which  he  had  brought  down  to  the  common  room  with  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  some  reason  this  seemed  to  annoy  Hermione  as  well;  she  didn’t  say</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">criticizing her cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  lunchtime  they  went  down  to  the  Great  Hall,  to  find  that  the  House</p>
<p class="calibre1">tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table, set</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  twelve,  stood  in  the  middle  of  the  room.  Professors  Dumbledore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very</p>
<p class="calibre1">old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat. There were only three other students, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth</p>
<p class="calibre1">year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merry  Christmas!”  said  Dumbledore  as  Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">approached the table. “As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use</p>
<p class="calibre1">the House tables. … Sit down, sit down!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crackers!” said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a large</p>
<p class="calibre1">silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large, pointed witch’s hat</p>
<p class="calibre1">topped with a stuffed vulture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  remembering  the  boggart,  caught  Ron’s  eye  and  they  both</p>
<p class="calibre1">grinned; Snape’s mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who swapped it for his wizard’s hat at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dig in!” he advised the table, beaming around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Harry  was  helping  himself  to  roast  potatoes,  the  doors  of  the  Great</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hall  opened  again.  It  was  Professor  Trelawney,  gliding  toward  them  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasion,  making  her  look  more  than  ever  like  a  glittering,  oversized</p>
<p class="calibre1">dragonfly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!” said Dumbledore, standing up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  have  been  crystal  gazing,  Headmaster,”  said  Professor  Trelawney  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her  mistiest,  most  faraway  voice,  “and  to  my  astonishment,  I  saw  myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">abandoning  my  solitary  luncheon  and  coming  to  join  you.  Who  am  I  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do</p>
<p class="calibre1">beg you to forgive my lateness. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,  certainly,”  said  Dumbledore,  his  eyes  twinkling.  “Let  me</p>
<p class="calibre1">draw you up a chair —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape and</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall.  Professor  Trelawney,  however,  did  not  sit  down;  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered a</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of soft scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first to rise will be the first to die!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll  risk  it,  Sibyll,”  said  Professor  McGonagall  impatiently.  “Do  sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">down, the turkey’s getting stone cold.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, </p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  table.  Professor  McGonagall  poked  a  large  spoon  into  the  nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">tureen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tripe, Sibyll?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Trelawney  ignored  her.  Eyes  open  again,  she  looked  around</p>
<p class="calibre1">once more and said, “But where is dear Professor Lupin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,” said Dumbledore, indicating that</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody should start serving themselves. “Most unfortunate that it should</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen on Christmas Day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?” said Professor McGonagall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">her eyebrows raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly I knew, Minerva,” she said quietly. “But one does not parade</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  fact  that  one  is  All-Knowing.  I  frequently  act  as  though  I  am  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That explains a great deal,” said Professor McGonagall tartly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney’s voice suddenly became a good deal less misty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will</p>
<p class="calibre1">not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine that,” said Professor McGonagall dryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I doubt,” said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">put  an  end  to  Professor  McGonagall  and  Professor  Trelawney’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation,  “that  Professor  Lupin  is  in  any  immediate  danger.  Severus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ve made the potion for him again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Headmaster,” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Then he should be up and about in no time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">… Derek, have you had any of these chipolatas? They’re excellent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first-year  boy  went  furiously  red  on  being  addressed  directly  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore, and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Trelawney  behaved  almost  normally  until  the  very  end  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas  dinner,  two  hours  later.  Full  to  bursting  with  Christmas  dinner</p>
<p class="calibre1">and still wearing their party hats, Harry and Ron got up first from the table</p>
<p class="calibre1">and she shrieked loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>“I  doubt  it  will  make  much  difference,”  said  Professor  McGonagall</p>
<p class="calibre1">coldly, “unless a mad axe-man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first into the entrance hall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly affronted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coming?” Harry said to Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”  Hermione  muttered,  “I  want  a  quick  word  with  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes,” yawned Ron as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they made their way into the entrance hall, which was completely devoid of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mad axe-men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they reached the portrait hole, they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas  party  with  a  couple  of  monks,  several  previous  headmasters  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts, and his fat pony. He pushed up his visor and toasted them with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">flagon of mead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merry — hic — Christmas! Password?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scurvy cur,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  the  same  to  you,  sir!”  roared  Sir  Cadogan  as  the  painting  swung</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward to admit them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  went  straight  up  to  the  dormitory,  collected  the  Firebolt  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">them downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there  were  no  bent  twigs  to  clip,  and  the  handle  was  so  shiny  already  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every</p>
<p class="calibre1">angle  until  the  portrait  hole  opened,  and  Hermione  came  in,  accompanied</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, Harry had</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen her in the common room only once before, and that had been to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  very  grave  announcement.  He  and  Ron  stared  at  her,  both  holding  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt.  Hermione  walked  around  them,  sat  down,  picked  up  the  nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">book, and hid her face behind it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s it, is it?” said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fireside and staring at the Firebolt. “Miss Granger has just informed me</p>
<p class="calibre1">that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her forehead</p>
<p class="calibre1">reddening over the top of her book, which was upside down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I?” said Professor McGonagall, but she didn’t wait for an answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">before  pulling  the  Firebolt  out  of  their  hands.  She  examined  it  carefully</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>from handle to twig-ends. “Hmm. And there was no note at all, Potter? No</p>
<p class="calibre1">card? No message of any kind?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry blankly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see … ,” said Professor McGonagall. “Well, I’m afraid I will have to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take this, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W — what?” said Harry, scrambling to his feet. “Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will need to be checked for jinxes,” said Professor McGonagall. “Of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course, I’m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick</p>
<p class="calibre1">will strip it down —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strip  it  down?”  repeated  Ron,  as  though  Professor  McGonagall  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks,” said Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s nothing wrong with it!” said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honestly, Professor —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can’t know that, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“not  until  you’ve  flown  it,  at  any  rate,  and  I’m  afraid  that  is  out  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">you informed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">on Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What did you go running to McGonagall for</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">up and faced Ron defiantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall agrees with me — that</p>
<p class="calibre1">that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a><img src="index-171_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Patronus</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn’t stop him from</p>
<p class="calibre1">being angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, he didn’t know</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether he would ever see it again. He was positive that there was nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx tests? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  was  furious  with  Hermione  too.  As  far  as  he  was  concerned,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stripping-down  of  a  brand-new  Firebolt  was  nothing  less  than  criminal</p>
<p class="calibre1">damage.  Hermione,  who  remained  convinced  that  she  had  acted  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken refuge in the library and didn’t try to persuade her to come back. All</p>
<p class="calibre1">in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after New</p>
<p class="calibre1">Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Had  a  good  Christmas?”  he  said,  and  then,  without  waiting  for  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer,  he  sat  down,  lowered  his  voice,  and  said,  “I’ve  been  doing  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking  over  Christmas,  Harry.  After  the  last  match,  you  know.  If  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors  come  to  the  next  one  …  I  mean  …  we  can’t  afford  you  to  —</p>
<p class="calibre1">well —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood broke off, looking awkward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>“I’m working on it,” said Harry quickly. “Professor Lupin said he’d train</p>
<p class="calibre1">me  to  ward  off  the  dementors.  We  should  be  starting  this  week.  He  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d have time after Christmas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Wood, his expression clearing. “Well, in that case — I really</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t  want  to  lose  you  as  Seeker,  Harry.  And  have  you  ordered  a  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">broom yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!  You’d  better  get  a  move  on,  you  know  —  you  can’t  ride  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He got a Firebolt for Christmas,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A  <i class="calibre3">Firebolt</i>? No! Seriously? A — a real  <i class="calibre3">Firebolt</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  get  excited,  Oliver,”  said  Harry  gloomily.  “I  haven’t  got  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore. It was confiscated.” And he explained all about how the Firebolt</p>
<p class="calibre1">was now being checked for jinxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius  Black,”  Harry  said  wearily.  “He’s  supposed  to  be  after  me.  So</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall reckons he might have sent it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waving  aside  the  information  that  a  famous  murderer  was  after  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeker, Wood said, “But Black couldn’t have bought a Firebolt! He’s on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">run! The whole country’s on the lookout for him! How could he just walk</p>
<p class="calibre1">into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” said Harry, “but McGonagall still wants to strip it down —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood went pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll go and talk to her, Harry,” he promised. “I’ll make her see reason. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">A Firebolt … a real Firebolt, on our team … She wants Gryffindor to win as</p>
<p class="calibre1">much as we do. … I’ll make her see sense. A  <i class="calibre3">Firebolt</i> …” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  spending  two  hours  on  the  grounds  on  a  raw  January  morning,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crumbling, white-hot logs. The first Divination lesson of the new term was</p>
<p class="calibre1">much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to; after</p>
<p class="calibre1">his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on his anti-dementor</p>
<p class="calibre1">lessons as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah  yes,”  said  Lupin,  when  Harry  reminded  him  of  his  promise  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of class. “Let me see … how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  History  of  Magic  classroom  should  be  large  enough.  …  I’ll  have  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">think carefully about how we’re going to do this. … We can’t bring a real</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor into the castle to practice on. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still looks ill, doesn’t he?” said Ron as they walked down the corridor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">heading to dinner. “What d’you reckon’s the matter with him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  loud  and  impatient  “tuh”  from  behind  them.  It  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione, who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag, which was so full of books it wouldn’t close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what are you tutting at us for?” said Ron irritably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,” said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  you  were,”  said  Ron.  “I  said  I  wonder  what’s  wrong  with  Lupin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  isn’t  it   <i class="calibre3">obvious</i>?”  said  Hermione,  with  a  look  of  maddening</p>
<p class="calibre1">superiority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you don’t want to tell us, don’t,” snapped Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,” said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She doesn’t know,” said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. “She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">just trying to get us to talk to her again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">At  eight  o’clock  on  Thursday  evening,  Harry  left  Gryffindor  Tower  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  lit  the  lamps  with  his  wand  and  had  waited  only  five  minutes  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he heaved</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto Professor Binns’ desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another  boggart,”  said  Lupin,  stripping  off  his  cloak.  “I’ve  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">combing  the  castle  ever  since  Tuesday,  and  very  luckily,  I  found  this  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">lurking inside Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  able  to  practice  on  him.  I  can  store  him  in  my  office  when  we’re  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">using him; there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So …” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  should  do  the  same.  “The  spell  I  am  going  to  try  and  teach  you  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is called the Patronus Charm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How does it work?” said Harry nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  when  it  works  correctly,  it  conjures  up  a  Patronus,”  said  Lupin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“which  is  a  kind  of  anti-dementor  —  a  guardian  that  acts  as  a  shield</p>
<p class="calibre1">between you and the dementor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  had  a  sudden  vision  of  himself  crouching  behind  a  Hagrid-sized</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind  of  positive  force,  a  projection  of  the  very  things  that  the  dementor</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeds  upon  —  hope,  happiness,  the  desire  to  survive  —  but  it  cannot  feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified</p>
<p class="calibre1">wizards have difficulty with it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And how do you conjure it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with</p>
<p class="calibre1">all your might, on a single, very happy memory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  cast  his  mind  about  for  a  happy  memory.  Certainly,  nothing  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,”  he  said,  trying  to  recall  as  exactly  as  possible  the  wonderful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">soaring sensation of his stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  incantation  is  this  —”  Lupin  cleared  his  throat.  “<i class="calibre3">Expecto</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">patronum</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expecto  patronum</i>,”  Harry  repeated  under  his  breath,  “<i class="calibre3">expecto</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">patronum. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh  —  yeah  —”  said  Harry,  quickly  forcing  his  thoughts  back  to  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">first  broom  ride.  “<i class="calibre3">Expecto  patrono</i>  —  no,  <i class="calibre3">patronum</i>  —  sorry  —   <i class="calibre3">expecto</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">patronum, expecto patronum</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like</p>
<p class="calibre1">a wisp of silvery gas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you see that?” said Harry excitedly. “Something happened!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very  good,”  said  Lupin,  smiling.  “Right,  then  —  ready  to  try  it  on  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”  Harry  said,  gripping  his  wand  very  tightly,  and  moving  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">something  else  kept  intruding.  …  Any  second  now,  he  might  hear  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother again … but he shouldn’t think that, or he  <i class="calibre3">would</i> hear her again, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he didn’t want to … or did he? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  dementor  rose  slowly  from  the  box,  its  hooded  face  turned  toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  one  glistening,  scabbed  hand  gripping  its  cloak.  The  lamps  around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box</p>
<p class="calibre1">and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A wave of piercing cold broke over him —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!” Harry yelled. “<i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Expecto</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  classroom  and  the  dementor  were  dissolving.  …  Harry  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">falling  again  through  thick  white  fog,  and  his  mother’s  voice  was  louder</p>
<p class="calibre1">than ever, echoing inside his head — “<i class="calibre3">Not Harry</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Not Harry</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Please</i> —  <i class="calibre3">I’ll</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">do anything</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Stand aside</i>.  <i class="calibre3">Stand aside, girl</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">classroom  lamps  were  alight  again.  He  didn’t  have  to  ask  what  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”  he  muttered,  sitting  up  and  feeling  cold  sweat  trickling  down</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind his glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you all right?” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes …” Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here —” Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. “Eat this before we try</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. I didn’t expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">astounded if you had.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s getting worse,” Harry muttered, biting off the Frog’s head. “I could</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear her louder that time — and him — Voldemort —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin looked paler than usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>“Harry, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than understand —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do!” said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog into his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth.  “I’ve  got  to!  What  if  the  dementors  turn  up  at  our  match  against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ravenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we lose this game we’ve lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Quidditch Cup!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All  right  then  …  ,”  said  Lupin.  “You  might  want  to  select  another</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on. … That one doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">seem to have been strong enough. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  thought  hard  and  decided  his  feelings  when  Gryffindor  had  won</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  House  Championship  last  year  had  definitely  qualified  as  very  happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?” said Lupin, gripping the box lid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready,”  said  Harry,  trying  hard  to  fill  his  head  with  happy  thoughts</p>
<p class="calibre1">about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen when the box opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go!” said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">once  more.  The  dementor  glided  forward,  drawing  its  breath;  one  rotting</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand was extending toward Harry —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!” Harry yelled. “<i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Expecto pat</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">White  fog  obscured  his  senses  …  big,  blurred  shapes  were  moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">around him … then came a new voice, a man’s voice, shouting, panicking</p>
<p class="calibre1">—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Lily, take Harry and go</i>!  <i class="calibre3">It’s him</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Go</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Run</i>!  <i class="calibre3">I’ll hold him off</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a door bursting open</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">— a cackle of high-pitched laughter —</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! Harry … wake up. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  was  tapping  Harry  hard  on  the  face.  This  time  it  was  a  minute</p>
<p class="calibre1">before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I heard my dad,” Harry mumbled. “That’s the first time I’ve ever heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">him — he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run</p>
<p class="calibre1">for it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn’t see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You heard James?” said Lupin in a strange voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>“Yeah …” Face dry, Harry looked up. “Why — you didn’t know my dad, </p>
<p class="calibre1">did you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  —  I  did,  as  a  matter  of  fact,”  said  Lupin.  “We  were  friends  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts.  Listen,  Harry  —  perhaps  we  should  leave  it  here  for  tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This charm is ridiculously advanced. … I shouldn’t have suggested putting</p>
<p class="calibre1">you through this. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”  said  Harry.  He  got  up  again.  “I’ll  have  one  more  go!  I’m  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking of happy enough things, that’s what it is. … Hang on. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory … one that he could</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn into a good, strong Patronus …</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  moment  when  he’d  first  found  out  he  was  a  wizard,  and  would  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving  the  Dursleys  for  Hogwarts!  If  that  wasn’t  a  happy  memory,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t know what was. … Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">the packing case once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against</p>
<p class="calibre1">his better judgment. “Concentrating hard? All right — go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of it; the room fell cold and dark —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">EXPECTO </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">PATRONUM</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry </p>
<p class="calibre1">bellowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">EXPECTO</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">PATRONUM</i>!  <i class="calibre3">EXPECTO PATRONUM</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again — except this time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and</p>
<p class="calibre1">louder  and  softer  again  —  and  he  could  still  see  the  dementor  —  it  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">halted — and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">legs felt like water, he was still on his feet — though for how much longer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he wasn’t sure —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Riddikulus</i>!” roared Lupin, springing forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus vanished along with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he’d just run a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mile,  and  felt  his  legs  shaking.  Out  of  the  corner  of  his  eye,  he  saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Lupin  forcing  the  boggart  back  into  the  packing  case  with  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent!”  Lupin  said,  striding  over  to  where  Harry  sat.  “Excellent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry! That was definitely a start!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can we have another go? Just one more go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>“Not now,” said Lupin firmly. “You’ve had enough for one night. Here</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes’ best chocolate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next</p>
<p class="calibre1">week?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">extinguishing  the  lamps  that  had  rekindled  with  the  disappearance  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor. A thought had just occurred to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor  Lupin?”  he  said.  “If  you  knew  my  dad,  you  must’ve  known</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius Black as well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin turned very quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What gives you that idea?” he said sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin’s face relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I knew him,” he said shortly. “Or I thought I did. You’d better be</p>
<p class="calibre1">off, Harry, it’s getting late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a corner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  took  a  detour  behind  a  suit  of  armor  and  sank  down  on  its  plinth  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">finish  his  chocolate,  wishing  he  hadn’t  mentioned  Black,  as  Lupin  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry’s thoughts wandered back to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his mother and father. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  felt  drained  and  strangely  empty,  even  though  he  was  so  full  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents’ last moments replayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside  his  head,  these  were  the  only  times  Harry  had  heard  their  voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">since he was a very small child. But he’d never be able to produce a proper</p>
<p class="calibre1">Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re  dead,”  he  told  himself  sternly.  “They’re  dead  and  listening  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">echoes of them won’t bring them back. You’d better get a grip on yourself if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you want that Quidditch Cup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  stood  up,  crammed  the  last  bit  of  chocolate  into  his  mouth,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">headed back to Gryffindor Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin won, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  would  take  second  place  if  they  beat  Ravenclaw  too.  He  therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">increased the number of team practices to five a week. This meant that with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin’s  anti-dementor  classes,  which  in  themselves  were  more  draining</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his</p>
<p class="calibre1">homework.  Even  so,  he  wasn’t  showing  the  strain  nearly  as  much  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione,  whose  immense  workload  finally  seemed  to  be  getting  to  her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  night,  without  fail,  Hermione  was  to  be  seen  in  a  corner  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">common  room,  several  tables  spread  with  books,  Arithmancy  charts,  rune</p>
<p class="calibre1">dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of</p>
<p class="calibre1">extensive  notes;  she  barely  spoke  to  anybody  and  snapped  when  she  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s she doing it?” Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">finishing  a  nasty  essay  on  Undetectable  Poisons  for  Snape.  Harry  looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doing what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Getting to all her classes!” Ron said. “I heard her talking to Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vector,  that  Arithmancy  witch,  this  morning.  They  were  going  on  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesterday’s lesson, but Hermione can’t’ve been there, because she was with</p>
<p class="calibre1">us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me she’s never</p>
<p class="calibre1">missed  a  Muggle  Studies  class,  but  half  of  them  are  at  the  same  time  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Divination, and she’s never missed one of them either!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione’s impossible</p>
<p class="calibre1">schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape’s essay. Two</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bad news, Harry. I’ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt. She — er — got a bit  <i class="calibre3">shirty</i> with me. Told me I’d got my priorities</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about</p>
<p class="calibre1">you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn’t care if it threw you off, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">long  as  you  caught  the  Snitch  first.”  Wood  shook  his  head  in  disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honestly, the way she was yelling at me … you’d think I’d said something</p>
<p class="calibre1">terrible. … Then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGonagall’s severe voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“  ‘As  long  as  necessary,  Wood’  …  I  reckon  it’s  time  you  ordered  a  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">broom,  Harry.  There’s  an  order  form  at  the  back  of   <i class="calibre3">Which Broomstick</i>   <i class="calibre3">…</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like Malfoy’s got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,” said Harry flatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but Harry still hadn’t ordered a new broom. He was now asking Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>McGonagall  for  news  of  the  Firebolt  after  every  Transfiguration  lesson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face</p>
<p class="calibre1">averted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor McGonagall told him</p>
<p class="calibre1">the twelfth time this happened, before he’d even opened his mouth. “We’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">checked  for  most  of  the  usual  curses,  but  Professor  Flitwick  believes  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall  <i class="calibre3">tell</i> you once we’ve finished</p>
<p class="calibre1">checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  make  matters  even  worse,  Harry’s  anti-dementor  lessons  were  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">going nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce  an  indistinct,  silvery  shadow  every  time  the  boggart-dementor</p>
<p class="calibre1">approached  him,  but  his  Patronus  was  too  feeble  to  drive  the  dementor</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. All it did was hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry of</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty</p>
<p class="calibre1">about his secret desire to hear his parents’ voices again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  fourth  week  of  practice.  “For  a  thirteen-year-old  wizard,  even  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t passing out anymore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  thought  a  Patronus  would  —  charge  the  dementors  down  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">something,” said Harry dispiritedly. “Make them disappear —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  true  Patronus  does  do  that,”  said  Lupin.  “But  you’ve  achieved  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">great  deal  in  a  very  short  space  of  time.  If  the  dementors  put  in  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at</p>
<p class="calibre1">bay long enough to get back to the ground.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  have  complete  confidence  in  you,”  said  Lupin,  smiling.  “Here  —</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ve  earned  a  drink  —  something  from  the  Three  Broomsticks.  You</p>
<p class="calibre1">won’t have tried it before —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I like that stuff!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin raised an eyebrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh  —  Ron  and  Hermione  brought  me  some  back  from  Hogsmeade,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry lied quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see,” said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. “Well —</p>
<p class="calibre1">let’s  drink  to  a  Gryffindor  victory  against  Ravenclaw!  Not  that  I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed to take sides, as a teacher … ,” he added hastily. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">been wondering for a while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s under a dementor’s hood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm … well, the only people who really know are in no condition to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They  call  it  the  Dementor’s  Kiss,”  said  Lupin,  with  a  slightly  twisted</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile.  “It’s  what  dementors  do  to  those  they  wish  to  destroy  utterly.  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp</p>
<p class="calibre1">their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and — and suck out his soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What — they kill — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much worse than that. You can exist without your</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  no  sense  of  self  anymore,  no  memory,  no  …  anything.  There’s  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance at all of recovery. You’ll just — exist. As an empty shell. And your</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul is gone forever … lost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, “It’s the fate that awaits</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius Black. It was in the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> this morning. The Ministry have</p>
<p class="calibre1">given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He deserves it,” he said suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think so?” said Lupin lightly. “Do you really think anyone deserves</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry defiantly. “For … for some things …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  would  have  liked  to  have  told  Lupin  about  the  conversation  he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he’d gone to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogsmeade  without  permission,  and  he  knew  Lupin  wouldn’t  be  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the</p>
<p class="calibre1">History of Magic classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  half  wished  that  he  hadn’t  asked  what  was  under  a  dementor’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hood,  the  answer  had  been  so  horrible,  and  he  was  so  lost  in  unpleasant</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do watch where you’re going, Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, Professor —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve  just  been  looking  for  you  in  the  Gryffindor  common  room.  Well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">here it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  anything  wrong  with  it  at  all.  You’ve  got  a  very  good  friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere, Potter. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnificent as ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">daresay you’ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday’s match, won’t you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Potter —  <i class="calibre3">do</i> try and win, won’t you? Or we’ll be out of the running for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the eighth year in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me</p>
<p class="calibre1">only last night. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speechless,  Harry  carried  the  Firebolt  back  upstairs  toward  Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tower.  As  he  turned  a  corner,  he  saw  Ron  dashing  toward  him,  grinning</p>
<p class="calibre1">from ear to ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She  gave  it  to  you?  Excellent!  Listen,  can  I  still  have  a  go  on  it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tomorrow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah … anything … ,” said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">month. “You know what — we should make up with Hermione. … She was</p>
<p class="calibre1">only trying to help. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. “She’s in the common room now — working, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for a change —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  turned  into  the  corridor  to  Gryffindor  Tower  and  saw  Neville</p>
<p class="calibre1">Longbottom,  pleading  with  Sir  Cadogan,  who  seemed  to  be  refusing  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  wrote  them  down!”  Neville  was  saying  tearfully.  “But  I  must’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">dropped them somewhere!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A  likely  tale!”  roared  Sir  Cadogan.  Then,  spotting  Harry  and  Ron:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good  even,  my  fine  young  yeomen!  Come  clap  this  loon  in  irons.  He  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to force entry to the chambers within!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, shut up,” said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve lost the passwords!” Neville told them miserably. “I made him tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">me  what  passwords  he  was  going  to  use  this  week,  because  he  keeps</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>changing them, and now I don’t know what I’ve done with them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oddsbodikins,”  said  Harry  to  Sir  Cadogan,  who  looked  extremely</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed  and  reluctantly  swung  forward  to  let  them  into  the  common</p>
<p class="calibre1">room.  There  was  a  sudden,  excited  murmur  as  every  head  turned  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next  moment,  Harry  was  surrounded  by  people  exclaiming  over  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’d you get it, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you let me have a go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ridden it yet, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on Cleansweep Sevens!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can I just  <i class="calibre3">hold</i> it, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was passed around and</p>
<p class="calibre1">admired  from  every  angle,  the  crowd  dispersed  and  Harry  and  Ron  had  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn’t rushed over to them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bent  over  her  work  and  carefully  avoiding  their  eyes.  Harry  and  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">approached her table and at last, she looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got it back,” said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See, Hermione? There wasn’t anything wrong with it!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well — there  <i class="calibre3">might</i> have been!” said Hermione. “I mean, at least you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know now that it’s safe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I suppose so,” said Harry. “I’d better put it upstairs —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll take it!” said Ron eagerly. “I’ve got to give Scabbers his rat tonic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it</p>
<p class="calibre1">away up the boys’ staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can I sit down, then?” Harry asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose so,” said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  which  the  ink  was  still  glistening,  at  the  even  longer  Muggle  Studies</p>
<p class="calibre1">essay (“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) and at the rune translation</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was now poring over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are you getting through all this stuff?” Harry asked her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  well  —  you  know  —  working  hard,”  said  Hermione.  Close-up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t you just drop a couple of subjects?” Harry asked, watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’t do that!” said Hermione, looking scandalized. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>“Arithmancy looks terrible,” said Harry, picking up a very complicated-</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking number chart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh  no,  it’s  wonderful!”  said  Hermione  earnestly.  “It’s  my  favorite</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject! It’s —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  exactly  what  was  wonderful  about  Arithmancy,  Harry  never  found</p>
<p class="calibre1">out.  At  that  precise  moment,  a  strangled  yell  echoed  down  the  boys’</p>
<p class="calibre1">staircase.  The  whole  common  room  fell  silent,  staring,  petrified,  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance.  Then  came  hurried  footsteps,  growing  louder  and  louder  —  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“LOOK!”  he  bellowed,  striding  over  to  Hermione’s  table.  “LOOK!”  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">yelled, shaking the sheets in her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, what — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something that looked horribly like —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“BLOOD!”  Ron  yelled  into  the  stunned  silence.  “HE’S  GONE!  AND</p>
<p class="calibre1">YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N — no,” said Hermione in a trembling voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron threw something down onto Hermione’s rune translation. Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Harry  leaned  forward.  Lying  on  top  of  the  weird,  spiky  shapes  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">several long, ginger cat hairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a><img src="index-185_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It  looked  like  the  end  of  Ron  and  Hermione’s  friendship.  Each  was  so</p>
<p class="calibre1">angry with the other that Harry couldn’t see how they’d ever make up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks’s attempts</p>
<p class="calibre1">to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,  and  was  still  trying  to  pretend  that  Crookshanks  was  innocent  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys’ beds. Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">meanwhile,  maintained  fiercely  that  Ron  had  no  proof  that  Crookshanks</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  eaten  Scabbers,  that  the  ginger  hairs  might  have  been  there  since</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas,  and  that  Ron  had  been  prejudiced  against  her  cat  ever  since</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks had landed on Ron’s head in the Magical Menagerie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally,  Harry  was  sure  that  Crookshanks  had  eaten  Scabbers,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  he  tried  to  point  out  to  Hermione  that  the  evidence  all  pointed  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">way, she lost her temper with Harry too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,  side  with  Ron,  I  knew  you  would!”  she  said  shrilly.  “First  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything’s my fault, isn’t it! Just leave me alone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, I’ve got a lot of work to do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,” said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred bracingly “And he’s been off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>was  probably  better  for  him  to  snuff  it  quickly  —  one  swallow  —  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably didn’t feel a thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Fred</i>!” said Ginny indignantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He bit Goyle for us once!” Ron said miserably. “Remember, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, that’s true,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. “Let the scar</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  Goyle’s  finger  stand  as  a  lasting  tribute  to  his  memory.  Oh,  come  on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what’s the point</p>
<p class="calibre1">of moaning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  last-ditch  attempt  to  cheer  Ron  up,  Harry  persuaded  him  to  come</p>
<p class="calibre1">along to the Gryffindor team’s final practice before the Ravenclaw match, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they’d finished. This did</p>
<p class="calibre1">seem to take Ron’s mind off Scabbers for a moment (“Great! Can I try and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoot a few goals on it?”) so they set off for the Quidditch field together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her professional opinion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it’s a slight</p>
<p class="calibre1">list to the tail end — you often find they develop a drag after a few years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ve  updated  the  handle  too,  a  bit  slimmer  than  the  Cleansweeps, </p>
<p class="calibre1">reminds  me  of  the  old  Silver  Arrows  —  a  pity  they’ve  stopped  making</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom it was too. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, “Er — Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to practice. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh — right — here you are, then, Potter,” said Madam Hooch. “I’ll sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">over here with Weasley …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow’s match. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It’s Cho</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chang.  She’s  a  fourth  year,  and  she’s  pretty  good.  …  I  really  hoped  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t be fit, she’s had some problems with injuries. …” Wood scowled</p>
<p class="calibre1">his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, “On the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke</p>
<p class="calibre1">next to the Firebolt.” He gave Harry’s broom a look of fervent admiration, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then said, “Okay, everyone, let’s go —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>And  at  long  last,  Harry  mounted  his  Firebolt,  and  kicked  off  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  better  than  he’d  ever  dreamed.  The  Firebolt  turned  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lightest  touch;  it  seemed  to  obey  his  thoughts  rather  than  his  grip;  it  sped</p>
<p class="calibre1">across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green-and-gray</p>
<p class="calibre1">blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went</p>
<p class="calibre1">into  a  perfectly  controlled  dive,  brushing  the  grassy  field  with  his  toes</p>
<p class="calibre1">before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out!” Wood called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped it</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds</p>
<p class="calibre1">had caught it tightly in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it</p>
<p class="calibre1">lurking near Katie Bell’s knee, looped her easily, and caught it again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  best  practice  ever;  the  team,  inspired  by  the  presence  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt  in  their  midst,  performed  their  best  moves  faultlessly,  and  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time they hit the ground again, Wood didn’t have a single criticism to make, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow!” said Wood. “Not unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">— Harry, you’ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were</p>
<p class="calibre1">stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore’d go ballistic,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Fred confidently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  let’s  hope  not,”  said  Wood.  “Anyway  —  good  work,  everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s get back to the tower … turn in early —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  staying  out  for  a  bit;  Ron  wants  a  go  on  the  Firebolt,”  Harry  told</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here you go,” said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron,  an  expression  of  ecstasy  on  his  face,  mounted  the  broom  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  field,  watching  him.  Night  had  fallen  before  Madam  Hooch  awoke</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  start,  told  Harry  and  Ron  off  for  not  waking  her,  and  insisted  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they go back to the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy</p>
<p class="calibre1">stadium,  discussing  the  Firebolt’s  superbly  smooth  action,  its  phenomenal</p>
<p class="calibre1">acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward the castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  Harry,  glancing  to  his  left,  saw  something  that  made  his  heart  turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">over — a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the matter?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, “<i class="calibre3">Lumos</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  beam  of  light  fell  across  the  grass,  hit  the  bottom  of  a  tree,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">illuminated  its  branches;  there,  crouching  among  the  budding  leaves,  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get out of here!” Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone</p>
<p class="calibre1">lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See?”  Ron  said  furiously,  chucking  the  stone  down  again.  “She’s  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">letting  him  wander  about  wherever  he  wants  —  probably  washing  down</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers with a couple of birds now. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped through</p>
<p class="calibre1">him;  he  had  been  sure  for  a  moment  that  those  eyes  had  belonged  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grim.  They  set  off  for  the  castle  once  more.  Slightly  ashamed  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment of panic, Harry didn’t say anything to Ron — nor did he look left</p>
<p class="calibre1">or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of</p>
<p class="calibre1">guard  of  honor.  As  Harry  entered  the  Great  Hall,  heads  turned  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction  of  the  Firebolt,  and  there  was  a  good  deal  of  excited  muttering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  saw,  with  enormous  satisfaction,  that  the  Slytherin  team  were  all</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking thunderstruck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you see his face?” said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfoy. “He</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t believe it! This is brilliant!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put it here, Harry,” he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  carefully  turning  it  so  that  its  name  faced  upward.  People  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ravenclaw  and  Hufflepuff  tables  were  soon  coming  over  to  look.  Cedric</p>
<p class="calibre1">Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>replacement  for  his  Nimbus,  and  Percy’s  Ravenclaw  girlfriend,  Penelope</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily as she examined the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt closely “Penelope and I have got a bet on,” he told the team. “Ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">Galleons on the outcome of the match!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry  —  make  sure  you  win,”  said  Percy,  in  an  urgent  whisper.  “<i class="calibre3">I</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">haven’t got ten Galleons. </i> Yes, I’m coming, Penny!” And he bustled off to</p>
<p class="calibre1">join her in a piece of toast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?” said a cold, drawling voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Draco  Malfoy  had  arrived  for  a  closer  look,  Crabbe  and  Goyle  right</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, reckon so,” said Harry casually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got  plenty  of  special  features,  hasn’t  it?”  said  Malfoy,  eyes  glittering</p>
<p class="calibre1">maliciously. “Shame it doesn’t come with a parachute — in case you get too</p>
<p class="calibre1">near a dementor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,” said Harry. “Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">it could catch the Snitch for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Gryffindor  team  laughed  loudly.  Malfoy’s  pale  eyes  narrowed,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  stalked  away.  They  watched  him  rejoin  the  rest  of  the  Slytherin  team, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  put  their  heads  together,  no  doubt  asking  Malfoy  whether  Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">broom really was a Firebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  weather  couldn’t  have  been  more  different  from  their  match  against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel  the  excitement  only  a  Quidditch  match  could  bring.  They  could  hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his</p>
<p class="calibre1">black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped</p>
<p class="calibre1">he wouldn’t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the crowd, watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they prepared to leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">the locker rooms. “If we lose this match, we’re out of the running. Just —</p>
<p class="calibre1">just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we’ll be okay!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw</p>
<p class="calibre1">team,  dressed  in  blue,  were  already  standing  in  the  middle  of  the  field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter</p>
<p class="calibre1">than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn’t help noticing, nervous as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his stomach that he didn’t think had anything to do with nerves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wood,  Davies,  shake  hands,”  Madam  Hooch  said  briskly,  and  Wood</p>
<p class="calibre1">shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mount your brooms … on my whistle … three — two — one —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  any  other  broom;  he  soared  around  the  stadium  and  began  squinting</p>
<p class="calibre1">around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was</p>
<p class="calibre1">being provided by the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potter  is  flying  for  Gryffindor.  According  to   <i class="calibre3">Which  Broomstick, </i>  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt’s  going  to  be  the  broom  of  choice  for  the  national  teams  at  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">year’s World Championship —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jordan,  would  you  mind  telling  us  what’s  going  on  in  the  match?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">interrupted Professor McGonagall’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of background information</p>
<p class="calibre1">— the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jordan!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor heading</p>
<p class="calibre1">for goal …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was</p>
<p class="calibre1">undoubtedly a very good flier — she kept cutting across him, forcing him to</p>
<p class="calibre1">change direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Show her your acceleration, Harry!” Fred yelled as he whooshed past in</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  urged  the  Firebolt  forward  as  they  rounded  the  Ravenclaw  goal</p>
<p class="calibre1">posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw it — the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  dived;  Cho  saw  what  he  was  doing  and  tore  after  him  —  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>ten feet away —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, </p>
<p class="calibre1">crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  great  “Ooooooh”  of  disappointment  from  the  Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">supporters,  but  much  applause  for  their  Beater  from  the  Ravenclaw  end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Potter’s  really  putting  it  through  its  paces  now,  see  it  turn  —  Chang’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Comet  is  just  no  match  for  it,  the  Firebolt’s  precision-balance  is  really</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticeable in these long —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“JORDAN!  ARE  YOU  BEING  PAID  TO  ADVERTISE  FIREBOLTS? </p>
<p class="calibre1">GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor  only  fifty  points  ahead  —  if  Cho  got  the  Snitch  before  him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ravenclaw  would  win.  Harry  dropped  lower,  narrowly  avoiding  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically — a glint of gold, a flutter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of tiny wings — the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead — but just then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!” Wood roared</p>
<p class="calibre1">as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. “KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM</p>
<p class="calibre1">IF YOU HAVE TO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch herself. … All</p>
<p class="calibre1">right, then … if she wanted to tail him, she’d have to take the consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…</p>
<p class="calibre1">He dived again, and Cho, thinking he’d seen the Snitch, tried to follow; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  pulled  out  of  the  dive  very  sharply;  she  hurtled  downward;  he  rose</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time — the Snitch</p>
<p class="calibre1">was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the Snitch with every second — then —</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>“Oh!” screamed Cho, pointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Distracted, Harry looked down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn’t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">whipped out his wand and roared, “<i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something  silver-white,  something  enormous,  erupted  from  the  end  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn’t pause to</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead — he was nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam Hooch’s whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was</p>
<p class="calibre1">hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s my boy!” Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all</p>
<p class="calibre1">kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head</p>
<p class="calibre1">would come off. In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way</p>
<p class="calibre1">back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes!” Ron yelled, yanking Harry’s arm into the air. “Yes! Yes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well  <i class="calibre3">done, </i> Harry!” said Percy, looking delighted. “Ten Galleons to me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Must find Penelope, excuse me —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good for you, Harry!” roared Seamus Finnigan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ruddy  brilliant!”  boomed  Hagrid  over  the  heads  of  the  milling</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was quite some Patronus,” said a voice in Harry’s ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  dementors  didn’t  affect  me  at  all!”  Harry  said  excitedly.  “I  didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel a thing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That would be because they — er — weren’t dementors,” said Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin. “Come and see —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>Harry  stared.  Lying  in  a  crumpled  heap  on  the  ground  were  Malfoy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling</p>
<p class="calibre1">to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy had been standing on Goyle’s shoulders. Standing over them, with</p>
<p class="calibre1">an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An unworthy trick!” she was shouting. “A low and cowardly attempt to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sabotage  the  Gryffindor  Seeker!  Detention  for  all  of  you,  and  fifty  points</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Slytherin!  I  shall  be  speaking  to  Professor  Dumbledore  about  this, </p>
<p class="calibre1">make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  anything  could  have  set  the  seal  on  Gryffindor’s  victory,  it  was  this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron,  who  had  fought  his  way  through  to  Harry’s  side,  doubled  up  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Goyle’s head still stuck inside it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come  on,  Harry!”  said  George,  fighting  his  way  over.  “Party! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor common room, now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium</p>
<p class="calibre1">and back up to the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went</p>
<p class="calibre1">on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  couple  of  hours  and  returned  with  armfuls  of  bottles  of  butterbeer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How  did  you  do  that?”  squealed  Angelina  Johnson  as  George  started</p>
<p class="calibre1">throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With  a  little  help  from  Moony,  Wormtail,  Padfoot,  and  Prongs,”  Fred</p>
<p class="calibre1">muttered in Harry’s ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  one  person  wasn’t  joining  in  the  festivities.  Hermione,  incredibly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled  <i class="calibre3">Home</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. </i> Harry broke away from the table</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  Fred  and  George  had  started  juggling  butterbeer  bottles  and  went</p>
<p class="calibre1">over to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you even come to the match?” he asked her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course I did,” said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking up. “And I’m very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I need to read this by Monday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>“Come  on,  Hermione,  come  and  have  some  food,”  Harry  said,  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hatchet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t, Harry. I’ve still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. “Anyway …” She glanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">over at Ron too. “<i class="calibre3">He</i> doesn’t want me to join in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If Scabbers hadn’t just been  <i class="calibre3">eaten, </i> he could have had some of those Fudge</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flies. He used to really like them —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  burst  into  tears.  Before  Harry  could  say  or  do  anything,  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the</p>
<p class="calibre1">staircase to the girls’ dormitories and out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was sorry — but she’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">never  admit  she’s  wrong,  Hermione.  She’s  still  acting  like  Scabbers  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone on vacation or something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up</p>
<p class="calibre1">in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still</p>
<p class="calibre1">discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  hangings  of  his  four-poster  shut  to  block  out  a  ray  of  moonlight,  lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  a  very  strange  dream.  He  was  walking  through  a  forest,  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Firebolt  over  his  shoulder,  following  something  silvery-white.  It  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch glimpses</p>
<p class="calibre1">of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out, and ahead he could</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing and —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! </p>
<p class="calibre1">NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry woke as suddenly as though he’d been hit in the face. Disoriented</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  total  darkness,  he  fumbled  with  his  hangings  —  he  could  hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice from the other side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the room: “What’s going on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  thought  he  heard  the  dormitory  door  slam.  At  last  finding  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>Thomas lit his lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  was  sitting  up  in  bed,  the  hangings  torn  from  one  side,  a  look  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">utmost terror on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?” said Dean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  all  scrambled  out  of  bed;  Harry  reached  the  dormitory  door  first, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleepy voices called after them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who shouted?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’re you doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the debris from the party. It was deserted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you  <i class="calibre3">sure</i> you weren’t dreaming, Ron?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m telling you, I saw him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s all the noise?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  of  the  girls  had  come  down  their  staircase,  pulling  on  dressing</p>
<p class="calibre1">gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent, are we carrying on?” said Fred Weasley brightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone   back   upstairs!”   said   Percy,   hurrying   into   the common</p>
<p class="calibre1">room and pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perce  —  Sirius  Black!”  said  Ron  faintly.  “In  our  dormitory!  With  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">knife! Woke me up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The common room went very still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense!” said Percy, looking startled. “You had too much to eat, Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">— had a nightmare —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m telling you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, really, enough’s enough!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she entered the common room and stared furiously around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  am  delighted  that  Gryffindor  won  the  match,  but  this  is  getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I certainly didn’t authorize this, Professor!” said Percy, puffing himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">up indignantly. “I was just telling them all to get back to bed! My brother</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>Ron here had a nightmare —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“IT WASN’T A NIGHTMARE!” Ron yelled. “PROFESSOR, I WOKE</p>
<p class="calibre1">UP,  AND  SIRIUS  BLACK  WAS  STANDING  OVER  ME,  HOLDING  A</p>
<p class="calibre1">KNIFE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall stared at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  be  ridiculous,  Weasley,  how  could  he  possibly  have  gotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the portrait hole?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask  him!”  said  Ron,  pointing  a  shaking  finger  at  the  back  of  Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cadogan’s picture. “Ask him if he saw —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glaring  suspiciously  at  Ron,  Professor  McGonagall  pushed  the  portrait</p>
<p class="calibre1">back open and went outside. The whole common room listened with bated</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly, good lady!” cried Sir Cadogan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  —  you   <i class="calibre3">did</i>?”  said  Professor  McGonagall.  “But  —  but  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">password!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  had  ’em!”  said  Sir  Cadogan  proudly.  “Had  the  whole  week’s,  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">lady! Read ’em off a little piece of paper!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  McGonagall  pulled  herself  back  through  the  portrait  hole  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which  person,”  she  said,  her  voice  shaking,  “which  abysmally  foolish</p>
<p class="calibre1">person wrote down this week’s passwords and left them lying around?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  utter  silence,  broken  by  the  smallest  of  terrified  squeaks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville  Longbottom,  trembling  from  head  to  fluffy-slippered  toes,  raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">his hand slowly into the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a><img src="index-197_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Snape’s Grudge</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  being  searched  again,  and  the  whole  House  stayed  awake  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">common room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout  the  day,  everywhere  they  went  they  saw  signs  of  tighter</p>
<p class="calibre1">security;  Professor  Flitwick  could  be  seen  teaching  the  front  doors  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize  a  large  picture  of  Sirius  Black;  Filch  was  suddenly  bustling  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  down  the  corridors,  boarding  up  everything  from  tiny  cracks  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls  to  mouse  holes.  Sir  Cadogan  had  been  fired.  His  portrait  had  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was</p>
<p class="calibre1">back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection.  A  bunch  of  surly  security  trolls  had  been  hired  to  guard  her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  paced  the  corridor  in  a  menacing  group,  talking  in  grunts  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">comparing the size of their clubs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry couldn’t help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">third  floor  remained  unguarded  and  unblocked.  It  seemed  that  Fred  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">George  had  been  right  in  thinking  that  they  —  and  now  Harry,  Ron,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione — were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway</p>
<p class="calibre1">within it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” Harry asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  know  he’s  not  coming  in  through  Honeyduke’s,”  said  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">dismissively “We’d’ve heard if the shop had been broken into.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up</p>
<p class="calibre1">too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life, people</p>
<p class="calibre1">were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  rather  enjoying  the  experience.  Though  still  severely  shaken  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night’s events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with a wealth of detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“… I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my dream, you know? But then there was this draft … I woke up and one</p>
<p class="calibre1">side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down. … I rolled over …</p>
<p class="calibre1">and I saw him standing over me … like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">…  holding  this  great  long  knife,  must’ve  been  twelve  inches  …  and  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled, and he  <i class="calibre3">scampered. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,  though?”  Ron  added  to  Harry  as  the  group  of  second-year  girls</p>
<p class="calibre1">who had been listening to his chilling tale departed. “Why did he run?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  had  been  wondering  the  same  thing.  Why  had  Black,  having  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">the wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved</p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve  years  ago  that  he  didn’t  mind  murdering  innocent  people,  and  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He must’ve known he’d have a job getting back out of the castle once</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’d yelled and woken people up,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’d’ve had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  kill  the  whole  House  to  get  back  through  the  portrait  hole  …  then  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would’ve met the teachers. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him  she  had  banned  him  from  all  future  Hogsmeade  visits,  given  him  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">detention,  and  forbidden  anyone  to  give  him  the  password  into  the  tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for</p>
<p class="calibre1">somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None  of  these  punishments,  however,  came  close  to  matching  the  one  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black’s break-in, she sent</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville  the  very  worst  thing  a  Hogwarts  student  could  receive  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakfast — a Howler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Neville  choked  as  a  huge  barn  owl  landed  in  front  of  him,  a  scarlet</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>envelope  clutched  in  its  beak.  Harry  and  Ron,  who  were  sitting  opposite</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once — Ron had got one from his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother the year before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Run for it, Neville,” Ron advised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville didn’t need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding it</p>
<p class="calibre1">before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler go off in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the entrance hall — Neville’s grandmother’s voice, magically magnified to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  hundred  times  its  usual  volume,  shrieking  about  how  he  had  brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">shame on the whole family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch! Oh — thanks, Hedwig.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  tore  open  the  envelope  while  Hedwig  helped  herself  to  some  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville’s cornflakes. The note inside said:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear</i>  <i class="calibre3">Harry and Ron, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">How about having tea with me this afternoon</i>  <i class="calibre3">’round six? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’ll come and collect you from the castle. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Cheers, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Hagrid</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  at  six  o’clock  that  afternoon,  Harry  and  Ron  left  Gryffindor  Tower, </p>
<p class="calibre1">passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid was already waiting for them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, Hagrid!” said Ron. “S’pose you want to hear about Saturday</p>
<p class="calibre1">night, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve already heard all abou’ it,” said Hagrid, opening the front doors and</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading them outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly put out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid’s cabin was Buckbeak, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">was stretched out on top of Hagrid’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings</p>
<p class="calibre1">folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets. Averting his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  very  horrible  yellow-and-orange  tie  hanging  from  the  top  of  Hagrid’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">wardrobe door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are they for, Hagrid?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Buckbeak’s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dangerous</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creatures,”  said  Hagrid.  “This  Friday.  Him  an’  me’ll  be  goin’  down  ter</p>
<p class="calibre1">London together. I’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  felt  a  nasty  pang  of  guilt.  He  had  completely  forgotten  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak’s trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron’s face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak’s  defense;  the  arrival  of  the  Firebolt  had  driven  it  clean  out  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, but they</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two,” said Hagrid, sitting himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">between them and looking uncharacteristically serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” said Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about her?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin comin’ down ter visit me a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot  since  Chris’mas.  Bin  feelin’  lonely.  Firs’  yeh  weren’  talking  to  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">because o’ the Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because  her  cat  acted  like  all  cats  do,”  Hagrid  continued  doggedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin’ through a rough time at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment. Bitten off more’n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">tryin’ ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak’s case, mind. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s  found  some  really  good  stuff  fer  me  …  reckon  he’ll  stand  a  good</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance now. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid,  we  should’ve  helped  as  well  —  sorry  —”  Harry  began</p>
<p class="calibre1">awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  not  blamin’  yeh!”  said  Hagrid,  waving  Harry’s  apology  aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gawd  knows  yeh’ve  had  enough  ter  be  gettin’  on  with.  I’ve  seen  yeh</p>
<p class="calibre1">practicin’ Quidditch ev’ry hour o’ the day an’ night — but I gotta tell yeh, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought you two’d value yer friend more’n broomsticks or rats. Tha’s all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>“Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She’s got</p>
<p class="calibre1">her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her again!” Ron said angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But she’s still sticking up for it! It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word</p>
<p class="calibre1">against it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,  well,  people  can  be  a  bit  stupid  abou’  their  pets,”  said  Hagrid</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid’s pillow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They spent  the  rest  of their  visit  discussing  Gryffindor’s improved</p>
<p class="calibre1">chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o’clock, Hagrid walked them back</p>
<p class="calibre1">up to the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  large  group  of  people  was  bunched  around  the  bulletin  board  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">they returned to the common room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hogsmeade,  next  weekend!”  said  Ron,  craning  over  the  heads  to  read</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  notice.  “What  d’you  reckon?”  he  added  quietly  to  Harry  as  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">went to sit down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  Filch  hasn’t  done  anything  about  the  passage  into  Honeydukes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…” Harry said, even more quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione,  who  was  sitting  at  the  table  right  behind  them  and  clearing  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">space in the wall of books that had been hiding her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  if  you  go  into  Hogsmeade  again  …  I’ll  tell  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall about that map!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can  you  hear  someone  talking,  Harry?”  growled  Ron,  not  looking  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">did to  <i class="calibre3">you</i>! I mean it, I’ll tell —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So  now  you’re  trying  to  get  Harry  expelled!”  said  Ron  furiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haven’t you done enough damage this year?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  opened  her  mouth  to  respond,  but  with  a  soft  hiss, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression  on  Ron’s  face,  gathered  up  Crookshanks,  and  hurried  away</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward the girls’ dormitories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So  how  about  it?”  Ron  said  to  Harry  as  though  there  had  been  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">interruption.  “Come  on,  last  time  we  went  you  didn’t  see  anything.  You</p>
<p class="calibre1">haven’t even been inside Zonko’s yet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  Saturday  morning,  Harry  packed  his  Invisibility  Cloak  in  his  bag, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slipped  the  Marauder’s  Map  into  his  pocket,  and  went  down  to  breakfast</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  everyone  else.  Hermione  kept  shooting  suspicious  looks  down  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table  at  him,  but  he  avoided  her  eye  and  was  careful  to  let  her  see  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeded to the front doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get back!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron grinned and winked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it</p>
<p class="calibre1">out.  A  tiny  dot  was  moving  in  his  direction.  Harry  squinted  at  it.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">minuscule writing next to it read  <i class="calibre3">Neville Longbottom. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, “<i class="calibre3">Dissendium</i>!” and shoved</p>
<p class="calibre1">his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville came</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! I forgot you weren’t going to Hogsmeade either!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,  Neville,”  said  Harry,  moving  swiftly  away  from  the  statue  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushing the map back into his pocket. “What are you up to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,” shrugged Neville. “Want a game of Exploding Snap?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and do that vampire</p>
<p class="calibre1">essay for Lupin —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll come with you!” said Neville brightly. “I haven’t done it either!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — hang on — yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great, you can help me!” said Neville, his round face anxious. “I don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand that thing about the garlic at all — do they have to eat it, or —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry’s shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  what  are  you  two  doing  here?”  said  Snape,  coming  to  a  halt  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking from one to the other. “An odd place to meet —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Harry’s immense disquiet, Snape’s black eyes flicked to the doorways</p>
<p class="calibre1">on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re not — meeting here,” said Harry. “We just — met here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed?”  said  Snape.  “You  have  a  habit  of  turning  up  in  unexpected</p>
<p class="calibre1">places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason. … I suggest</p>
<p class="calibre1">the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>Harry  and  Neville  set  off  without  another  word.  As  they  turned  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner,  Harry  looked  back.  Snape  was  running  one  of  his  hands  over  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one-eyed witch’s head, examining it closely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  managed  to  shake  Neville  off  at  the  Fat  Lady  by  telling  him  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">password,  then  pretending  he’d  left  his  vampire  essay  in  the  library  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubling  back.  Once  out  of  sight  of  the  security  trolls,  he  pulled  out  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">map again and held it close to his nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  third  floor  corridor  seemed  to  be  deserted.  Harry  scanned  the  map</p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully  and  saw,  with  a  leap  of  relief,  that  the  tiny  dot  labeled   <i class="calibre3">Severus</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Snape</i> was now back in its office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  sprinted  back  to  the  one-eyed  witch,  opened  her  hump,  heaved</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself  inside,  and  slid  down  to  meet  his  bag  at  the  bottom  of  the  stone</p>
<p class="calibre1">chute. He wiped the Marauder’s Map blank again, then set off at a run. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s me,” he muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What kept you?” Ron hissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape was hanging around. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They set off up the High Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where  are  you?”  Ron  kept  muttering  out  of  the  corner  of  his  mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you still there? This feels weird. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of</p>
<p class="calibre1">an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them; from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls (“Local Deliveries Only”), </p>
<p class="calibre1">which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry’s hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then they visited Zonko’s, which was so packed with students Harry had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There were</p>
<p class="calibre1">jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest dreams; Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave  Ron  whispered  orders  and  passed  him  some  gold  from  under  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloak.  They  left  Zonko’s  with  their  money  bags  considerably  lighter  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  had  been  on  entering,  but  their  pockets  bulging  with  Dungbombs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  day  was  fine  and  breezy,  and  neither  of  them  felt  like  staying</p>
<p class="calibre1">indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to</p>
<p class="calibre1">visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It stood a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>little  way  above  the  rest  of  the  village,  and  even  in  daylight  was  slightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even  the  Hogwarts  ghosts  avoid  it,”  said  Ron  as  they  leaned  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fence, looking up at it. “I asked Nearly Headless Nick … he says he’s heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George tried, </p>
<p class="calibre1">obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry,  feeling  hot  from  their  climb,  was  just  considering  taking  off  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloak  for  a  few  minutes  when  they  heard  voices  nearby.  Someone  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbing  toward  the  house  from  the  other  side  of  the  hill;  moments  later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“… should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearing to tell them about my arm … about how I couldn’t use it for three</p>
<p class="calibre1">months. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">… ‘There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest —’ … that hippogriff’s as good as dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent</p>
<p class="calibre1">grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing, Weasley?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suppose  you’d  love  to  live  here,  wouldn’t  you,  Weasley?  Dreaming</p>
<p class="calibre1">about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room</p>
<p class="calibre1">— is that true?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  seized  the  back  of  Ron’s  robes  to  stop  him  from  leaping  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leave him to me,” he hissed in Ron’s ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  opportunity  was  too  perfect  to  miss.  Harry  crept  silently  around</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful</p>
<p class="calibre1">of mud out of the path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,” Malfoy said to Ron. “Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying  to  imagine  what  he’s  saying  to  the  Committee  for  the  Disposal  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dangerous  Creatures.  D’you  think  he’ll  cry  when  they  cut  off  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hippogriff’s —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">SPLAT. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>Malfoy’s  head  jerked  forward  as  the  mud  hit  him;  his  silver-blond  hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">was suddenly dripping in muck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What the — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing</p>
<p class="calibre1">so  hard.  Malfoy,  Crabbe,  and  Goyle  spun  stupidly  on  the  spot,  staring</p>
<p class="calibre1">wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was that? Who did that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very  haunted  up  here,  isn’t  it?”  said  Ron,  with  the  air  of  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">commenting on the weather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no</p>
<p class="calibre1">use  against  ghosts.  Malfoy  was  staring  madly  around  at  the  deserted</p>
<p class="calibre1">landscape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded</p>
<p class="calibre1">some foul-smelling, green sludge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SPLATTER. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furiously on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It came from over there!” said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">spot some six feet to the left of Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe  blundered  forward,  his  long  arms  outstretched  like  a  zombie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe’s back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of pirouette in</p>
<p class="calibre1">midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe</p>
<p class="calibre1">could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck out his leg. Crabbe</p>
<p class="calibre1">stumbled — and his huge, flat foot caught the hem of Harry’s cloak. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a split second, Malfoy stared at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“AAARGH!” he yelled, pointing at Harry’s head. Then he turned tail and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  Harry  had  disappeared,  “you’d  better  run  for  it!  If  Malfoy  tells</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone — you’d better get back to the castle, quick —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you later,” said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the path toward Hogsmeade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe Malfoy? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak — nobody except Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>Harry’s stomach turned over — Dumbledore would know exactly what had</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened, if Malfoy said anything —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">through the trapdoor — Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and ran, flat out, along the passage. … Malfoy would get back first … how</p>
<p class="calibre1">long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, a sharp pain in his side, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t slow down until he reached the stone slide. He would have to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case Malfoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  tipped  off  a  teacher  —  he  hid  it  in  a  shadowy  corner,  then  started  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">climb, fast as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He reached the inside of the witch’s hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  head  through,  and  hoisted  himself  out;  the  hump  closed,  and  just  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  jumped  out  from  behind  the  statue,  he  heard  quick  footsteps</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  Snape.  He  approached  Harry  at  a  swift  walk,  his  black  robes</p>
<p class="calibre1">swishing, then stopped in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a look of suppressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look</p>
<p class="calibre1">innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly hid in his pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come with me, Potter,” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  followed  him  downstairs,  trying  to  wipe  his  hands  clean  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dungeons and then into Snape’s office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">trouble  then  too.  Snape  had  acquired  a  few  more  slimy  horrible  things  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit,” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat. Snape, however, remained standing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.  Malfoy  has  just  been  to  see  me  with  a  strange  story,  Potter,”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t say anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  tells  me  that  he  was  up  by  the  Shrieking  Shack  when  he  ran  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley — apparently alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, Harry didn’t speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>“Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large</p>
<p class="calibre1">amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tried to look mildly surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know, Professor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s eyes were boring into Harry’s. It was exactly like trying to stare</p>
<p class="calibre1">down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what</p>
<p class="calibre1">it might have been, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a long silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe he’d better go to Madam Pomfrey,” said Harry. “If he’s seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">things like —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  would  your  head  have  been  doing  in  Hogsmeade,  Potter?”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape  softly.  “Your  head  is  not  allowed  in  Hogsmeade.  No  part  of  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know that,” said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear. “It</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds like Malfoy’s having hallucin —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malfoy is not having hallucinations,” snarled Snape, and he bent down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a hand on each arm of Harry’s chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. “If</p>
<p class="calibre1">your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,” said Harry. “Like you told —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can anyone confirm that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  didn’t  say  anything.  Snape’s  thin  mouth  curled  into  a  horrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”  he  said,  straightening  up  again.  “Everyone  from  the  Minister  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic  downward  has  been  trying  to  keep  famous  Harry  Potter  safe  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius  Black.  But  famous  Harry  Potter  is  a  law  unto  himself.  Let  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wants to, with no thought for the consequences.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  stayed  silent.  Snape  was  trying  to  provoke  him  into  telling  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth. He wasn’t going to do it. Snape had no proof — yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How  extraordinarily  like  your  father  you  are,  Potter,”  Snape  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly,  his  eyes  glinting.  “He  too  was  exceedingly  arrogant.  A  small</p>
<p class="calibre1">amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers</p>
<p class="calibre1">… The resemblance between you is uncanny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  dad  didn’t   <i class="calibre3">strut, </i>”  said  Harry,  before  he  could  stop  himself.  “And</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither do I.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your  father  didn’t  set  much  store  by  rules  either,”  Snape  went  on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. “Rules were for lesser</p>
<p class="calibre1">mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“SHUT UP!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his last</p>
<p class="calibre1">night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn’t care that Snape’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What did you say to me, Potter</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled. “I know the truth, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn’t even be here</p>
<p class="calibre1">if it wasn’t for my dad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father</p>
<p class="calibre1">saved  my  life?”  he  whispered.  “Or  did  he  consider  the  details  too</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpleasant for precious Potter’s delicate ears?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry bit his lip. He didn’t know what had happened and didn’t want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">admit it — but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  would  hate  for  you  to  run  away  with  a  false  idea  of  your  father, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Potter,” he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. “Have you been imagining</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  act  of  glorious  heroism?  Then  let  me  correct  you  —  your  saintly</p>
<p class="calibre1">father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">resulted in my death if your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as</p>
<p class="calibre1">much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turn out your pockets, Potter!” he spat suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t move. There was a pounding in his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them</p>
<p class="calibre1">out, Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko’s tricks and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Marauder’s Map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snap picked up the Zonko’s bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>“Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a chance to tip Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">off before Snape saw him. “He — brought them back from Hogsmeade last</p>
<p class="calibre1">time —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed? And you’ve been carrying them around ever since? How very</p>
<p class="calibre1">touching … and what is this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face impassive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spare bit of parchment,” he said with a shrug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely  you  don’t  need  such  a  very   <i class="calibre3">old</i>  piece  of  parchment?”  he  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t I just — throw this away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His hand moved toward the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” Harry said quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So!”  said  Snape,  his  long  nostrils  quivering.  “Is  this  another  treasured</p>
<p class="calibre1">gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it — something else? A letter, perhaps, written</p>
<p class="calibre1">in invisible ink? Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dementors?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry blinked. Snape’s eyes gleamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let  me  see,  let  me  see  …  ,”  he  muttered,  taking  out  his  wand  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoothing the map out on his desk. “Reveal your secret!” he said, touching</p>
<p class="calibre1">the wand to the parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Show yourself!” Snape said, tapping the map sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield</p>
<p class="calibre1">the information you conceal!” Snape said, hitting the map with his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smooth surface of the map. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people’s business.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape  froze.  Harry  stared,  dumbstruck,  at  the  message.  But  the  map</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Snape is an ugly git.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It  would  have  been  very  funny  if  the  situation  hadn’t  been  so  serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there was more. …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a> <i class="calibre3">“Mr.  Padfoot  would  like  to  register  his  astonishment  that  an  idiot  like</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">that ever became a professor.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  closed  his  eyes  in  horror.  When  he’d  opened  them,  the  map  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">had its last word. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Mr. Wormtail bids, Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">his hair, the slimeball.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry waited for the blow to fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So … ,” said Snape softly. “We’ll see about this. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lupin!” Snape called into the fire. “I want a word!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was clambering out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You called, Severus?” said Lupin mildly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  certainly  did,”  said  Snape,  his  face  contorted  with  fury  as  he  strode</p>
<p class="calibre1">back  to  his  desk.  “I  have  just  asked  Potter  to  empty  his  pockets.  He  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">carrying this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed expression</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared on Lupin’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">was doing some very quick thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Well</i>?” said Snape again. “This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potter got such a thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  looked  up  and,  by  the  merest  half-glance  in  Harry’s  direction, </p>
<p class="calibre1">warned him not to interrupt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Full  of  Dark  Magic?”  he  repeated  mildly.  “Do  you  really  think  so, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Severus?  It  looks  to  me  as  though  it  is  merely  a  piece  of  parchment  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I imagine</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got it from a joke shop —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed?” said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. “You think a</p>
<p class="calibre1">joke  shop  could  supply  him  with  such  a  thing?  You  don’t  think  it  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely that he got it  <i class="calibre3">directly from the manufacturers</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>Harry didn’t understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently, </p>
<p class="calibre1">did Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?” he said. “Harry, do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you know any of these men?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see, Severus?” said Lupin, turning back to Snape. “It looks like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zonko product to me —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of breath, and stopped just short of Snape’s desk, clutching the stitch in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest and trying to speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  —  gave  —  Harry  —  that  —  stuff,”  he  choked.  “Bought  —  it  …  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zonko’s … ages — ago …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well!”  said  Lupin,  clapping  his  hands  together  and  looking  around</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheerfully. “That seems to clear that up! Severus, I’ll take this back, shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">I?”  He  folded  the  map  and  tucked  it  inside  his  robes.  “Harry,  Ron,  come</p>
<p class="calibre1">with me, I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us, Severus —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  didn’t  dare  look  at  Snape  as  they  left  his  office.  He,  Ron,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking. Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned to Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor, I —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  want  to  hear  explanations,”  said  Lupin  shortly.  He  glanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. “I happen to know</p>
<p class="calibre1">that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a map,” he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. “I don’t want to know</p>
<p class="calibre1">how it fell into your possession. I am, however,  <i class="calibre3">astounded</i> that you didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand  it  in.  Particularly  after  what  happened  the  last  time  a  student  left</p>
<p class="calibre1">information about the castle lying around. And I can’t let you have it back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did Snape think I’d got it from the manufacturers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because … ,” Lupin hesitated, “because these mapmakers would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted to lure you out of school. They’d think it extremely entertaining.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you  <i class="calibre3">know</i> them?” said Harry, impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve  met,”  he  said  shortly.  He  was  looking  at  Harry  more  seriously</p>
<p class="calibre1">than ever before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you</p>
<p class="calibre1">take  Sirius  Black  seriously.  But  I  would  have  thought  that  what  you  have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect</p>
<p class="calibre1">on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way</p>
<p class="calibre1">to repay them — gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any</p>
<p class="calibre1">point in Snape’s office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the Invisibility Cloak</p>
<p class="calibre1">— it was still down there, but he didn’t dare go and get it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s my fault,” said Ron abruptly. “I persuaded you to go. Lupin’s right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it was stupid, we shouldn’t’ve done it —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  broke  off;  they  reached  the  corridor  where  the  security  trolls  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">pacing,  and  Hermione  was  walking  toward  them.  One  look  at  her  face</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced  Harry  that  she  had  heard  what  had  happened.  His  heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">plummeted — had she told Professor McGonagall? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come to have a good gloat?” said Ron savagely as she stopped in front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them. “Or have you just been to tell on us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip</p>
<p class="calibre1">was trembling. “I just thought you ought to know … Hagrid lost his case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak is going to be executed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a><img src="index-213_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-213_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Quidditch Final</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He — he sent me this,” Hermione said, holding out the letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  took  it.  The  parchment  was  damp,  and  enormous  teardrops  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“They  can’t  do  this,”  said  Harry.  “They  can’t.  Buckbeak  isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malfoy’s  dad’s  frightened  the  Committee  into  it,”  said  Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wiping her eyes. “You know what he’s like. They’re a bunch of doddery old</p>
<p class="calibre1">fools, and they were scared. There’ll be an appeal, though, there always is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only I can’t see any hope. … Nothing will have changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,  it  will,”  said  Ron  fiercely.  “You  won’t  have  to  do  all  the  work</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone this time, Hermione. I’ll help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>“Oh, Ron!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione flung her arms around Ron’s neck and broke down completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron,  looking  quite  terrified,  patted  her  very  awkwardly  on  the  top  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">head. Finally, Hermione drew away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers … ,” she sobbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh — well — he was old,” said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she had let go of him. “And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad might get me an owl now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The safety measures imposed on the students since Black’s second break-</p>
<p class="calibre1">in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  evenings.  Their  only  chance  of  talking  to  him  was  during  Care  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magical Creatures lessons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He seemed numb with shock at the verdict. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“S’all  my  fault.  Got  all  tongue-tied.  They  was  all  sittin’  there  in  black</p>
<p class="calibre1">robes an’ I kep’ droppin’ me notes and forgettin’ all them dates yeh looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up fer me, Hermione. An’ then Lucius Malfoy stood up an’ said his bit, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Committee jus’ did exac’ly what he told ’em. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  still  the  appeal!”  said  Ron  fiercely.  “Don’t  give  up  yet,  we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">working on it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class. Ahead</p>
<p class="calibre1">they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking back, laughing derisively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“S’no  good,  Ron,”  said  Hagrid  sadly  as  they  reached  the  castle  steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  Committee’s  in  Lucius  Malfoy’s  pocket.  I’m  jus’  gonna  make  sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rest o’ Beaky’s time is the happiest he’s ever had. I owe him that. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his handkerchief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at him blubber!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors, </p>
<p class="calibre1">listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said Malfoy. “And he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed to be our teacher!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">got there first — SMACK! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  had  slapped  Malfoy  across  the  face  with  all  the  strength  she  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">muster.  Malfoy  staggered.  Harry,  Ron,  Crabbe,  and  Goyle  stood</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you  <i class="calibre3">dare</i> call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione!”  said  Ron  weakly,  and  he  tried  to  grab  her  hand  as  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">swung it back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get  <i class="calibre3">off, </i> Ron!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  pulled  out  her  wand.  Malfoy  stepped  backward.  Crabbe  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon,”  Malfoy  muttered,  and  in  a  moment,  all  three  of  them  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Hermione</i>!” Ron said again, sounding both stunned and impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  you’d  better  beat  him  in  the  Quidditch  final!”  Hermione  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrilly. “You just better had, because I can’t stand it if Slytherin wins!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re  due  in  Charms,”  said  Ron,  still  goggling  at  Hermione.  “We’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">better go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  hurried  up  the  marble  staircase  toward  Professor  Flitwick’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re late, boys!” said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">the classroom door. “Come along, quickly, wands out, we’re experimenting</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Cheering Charms today, we’ve already divided into pairs —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Hermione gone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  looked  around  too.  Hermione  hadn’t  entered  the  classroom,  yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s weird,” said Harry, staring at Ron. “Maybe — maybe she went to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bathroom or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Hermione didn’t turn up all lesson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She could’ve done with a Cheering Charm on her too,” said Ron as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">class  left  for  lunch,  all  grinning  broadly  —  the  Cheering  Charms  had  left</p>
<p class="calibre1">them with a feeling of great contentment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  wasn’t  at  lunch  either.  By  the  time  they  had  finished  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">apple  pie,  the  after-effects  of  the  Cheering  Charms  were  wearing  off,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t think Malfoy did something to her?” Ron said anxiously as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  passed  the  security  trolls,  gave  the  Fat  Lady  the  password</p>
<p class="calibre1">(“Flibbertigibbet”),  and  scrambled  through  the  portrait  hole  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>common room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arithmancy  book.  They  went  to  sit  down  on  either  side  of  her.  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">prodded her awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wh  —  what?”  said  Hermione,  waking  with  a  start  and  staring  wildly</p>
<p class="calibre1">around. “Is it time to go? W — which lesson have we got now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Divination,  but  it’s  not  for  another  twenty  minutes,”  said  Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, why didn’t you come to Charms?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? Oh no!” Hermione squeaked. “I forgot to go to Charms!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how could you forget?” said Harry. “You were with us till we were</p>
<p class="calibre1">right outside the classroom!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  believe  it!”  Hermione  wailed.  “Was  Professor  Flitwick  angry? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what, Hermione?” said Ron, looking down at the enormous</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arithmancy  book  Hermione  had  been  using  as  a  pillow.  “I  reckon  you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">cracking up. You’re trying to do too much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,  I’m  not!”  said  Hermione,  brushing  her  hair  out  of  her  eyes  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring hopelessly around for her bag. “I just made a mistake, that’s all! I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">better  go  and  see  Professor  Flitwick  and  say  sorry.  …  I’ll  see  you  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Divination!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawney’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harassed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  can’t  believe  I  missed  Cheering  Charms!  And  I  bet  they  come  up  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together  they  climbed  the  ladder  into  the  dim,  stifling  tower  room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glowing  on  every  little  table  was  a  crystal  ball  full  of  pearly  white  mist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  thought  we  weren’t  starting  crystal  balls  until  next  term,”  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">muttered,  casting  a  wary  eye  around  for  Professor  Trelawney,  in  case  she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was lurking nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t complain, this means we’ve finished palmistry,” Harry muttered</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.  “I  was  getting  sick  of  her  flinching  every  time  she  looked  at  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good  day  to  you!”  said  the  familiar,  misty  voice,  and  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney  made  her  usual  dramatic  entrance  out  of  the  shadows.  Parvati</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their crystal ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>“I  have  decided  to  introduce  the  crystal  ball  a  little  earlier  than  I  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">planned,”  said  Professor  Trelawney,  sitting  with  her  back  to  the  fire  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gazing around. “The fates have informed me that your examination in June</p>
<p class="calibre1">will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione snorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, honestly … ‘the fates have informed her’ … who sets the exam? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She does! What an amazing prediction!” she said, not troubling to keep her</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them, as her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,” she said dreamily. “I do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb’s infinite depths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes” </p>
<p class="calibre1">— Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">to stifle the noise — “so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will See before the end of the class.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  crystal  ball,  trying  to  keep  his  mind  empty  when  thoughts  such  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">“this is stupid” kept drifting across it. It didn’t help that Ron kept breaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seen anything yet?” Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour’s quiet</p>
<p class="calibre1">crystal gazing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,  there’s  a  burn  on  this  table,”  said  Ron,  pointing.  “Someone’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">spilled their candle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is such a waste of time,” Hermione hissed. “I could be practicing</p>
<p class="calibre1">something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney rustled past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would  anyone  like  me  to  help  them  interpret  the  shadowy  portents</p>
<p class="calibre1">within their Orb?” she murmured over the clinking of her bangles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  need  help,”  Ron  whispered.  “It’s  obvious  what  this  means. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s going to be loads of fog tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,  really!”  said  Professor  Trelawney  as  everyone’s  heads  turned  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  direction.  Parvati  and  Lavender  were  looking  scandalized.  “You  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">disturbing  the  clairvoyant  vibrations!”  She  approached  their  table  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">peered  into  their  crystal  ball.  Harry  felt  his  heart  sinking.  He  was  sure  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew what was coming —</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>“There is something here!” Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face  to  the  ball,  so  that  it  was  reflected  twice  in  her  huge  glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something moving … but what is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  prepared  to  bet  everything  he  owned,  including  his  Firebolt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that it wasn’t good news, whatever it was. And sure enough —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear … ,” Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. “It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">here,  plainer  than  ever  before  …  my  dear,  stalking  toward  you,  growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever closer … the Gr —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,  for   <i class="calibre3">goodness</i>’  sake!”  said  Hermione  loudly.  “Not  that  ridiculous</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grim  <i class="calibre3">again</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Trelawney  raised  her  enormous  eyes  to  Hermione’s  face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable</p>
<p class="calibre1">anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my  <i class="calibre3">dear, </i>  it  has  been  apparent  that  you  do  not  have  what  the  noble  art  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Divination requires. Indeed, I don’t remember ever meeting a student whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind was so hopelessly mundane.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a moment’s silence. Then —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine!” said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming  <i class="calibre3">Unfogging the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Future</i> back into her bag. “Fine!” she repeated, swinging the bag over her</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. “I give up! I’m leaving!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  to  the  whole  class’s  amazement,  Hermione  strode  over  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  took  a  few  minutes  for  the  class  to  settle  down  again.  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned abruptly</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Harry  and  Ron’s  table,  breathing  rather  heavily  as  she  tugged  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">gauzy shawl more closely to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooooo!”  said  Lavender  suddenly,  making  everyone  start.  “Oooooo, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Trelawney,  I’ve  just  remembered!  You  saw  her  leaving,  didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">you? Didn’t you, Professor? ‘ <i class="calibre3">Around Easter, one of our number will leave</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">us forever</i>!’ You said it  <i class="calibre3">ages</i> ago, Professor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs. … The Inner</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eye can be a burden, you know. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney could join their table instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some  day  Hermione’s  having,  eh?”  Ron  muttered  to  Harry,  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">awed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  glanced  into  the  crystal  ball  but  saw  nothing  but  swirling  white</p>
<p class="calibre1">mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The</p>
<p class="calibre1">last  thing  he  needed  was  another  near-fatal  accident,  with  the  Quidditch</p>
<p class="calibre1">final drawing ever nearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  so  much  homework.  Neville  Longbottom  seemed  close  to  a  nervous</p>
<p class="calibre1">collapse, and he wasn’t the only one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Call this a holiday!” Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoon. “The exams are ages away, what’re they playing at?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  nobody  had  as  much  to  do  as  Hermione.  Even  without  Divination, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she  was  taking  more  subjects  than  anybody  else.  She  was  usually  last  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave  the  common  room  at  night,  first  to  arrive  at  the  library  the  next</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning;  she  had  shadows  like  Lupin’s  under  her  eyes,  and  seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">constantly close to tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  had  taken  over  responsibility  for  Buckbeak’s  appeal.  When  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  names  like   <i class="calibre3">The  Handbook  of  Hippogriff  Psychology</i>  and   <i class="calibre3">Fowl  or</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Foul</i>?  <i class="calibre3">A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. </i> He was so absorbed, he even forgot</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be horrible to Crookshanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice</p>
<p class="calibre1">every  day,  not  to  mention  endless  discussions  of  tactics  with  Wood.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Easter  holidays.  Slytherin  was  leading  the  tournament  by  exactly  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred  points.  This  meant  (as  Wood  constantly  reminded  his  team)  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">also  meant  that  the  burden  of  winning  fell  largely  on  Harry,  because</p>
<p class="calibre1">capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you must catch it  <i class="calibre3">only</i> if we’re  <i class="calibre3">more than</i> fifty points up,” Wood told</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry constantly. “Only if we’re more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win</p>
<p class="calibre1">the match but lose the Cup. You’ve got that, haven’t you? You must catch</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Snitch only if we’re —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>“I KNOW, OLIVER!” Harry yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  whole  of  Gryffindor  House  was  obsessed  with  the  coming  match. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor  hadn’t  won  the  Quidditch  Cup  since  the  legendary  Charlie</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley (Ron’s second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry doubted</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  any  of  them,  even  Wood,  wanted  to  win  as  much  as  he  did.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even</p>
<p class="calibre1">more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  hadn’t  forgotten  Malfoy’s  attempt  to  sabotage  him  in  the  match</p>
<p class="calibre1">against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made him most</p>
<p class="calibre1">determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never,  in  anyone’s  memory,  had  a  match  approached  in  such  a  highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  two  teams  and  their  Houses  was  at  the  breaking  point.  A  number  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn’t walk to class</p>
<p class="calibre1">without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed  when  they  saw  him  surrounded  by  people.  Wood  had  given</p>
<p class="calibre1">instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House</p>
<p class="calibre1">took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get  to  classes  on  time  because  he  was  surrounded  by  a  vast,  chattering</p>
<p class="calibre1">crowd.  Harry  was  more  concerned  for  his  Firebolt’s  safety  than  his  own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he wasn’t flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently</p>
<p class="calibre1">dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still</p>
<p class="calibre1">there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night before the match. Even Hermione had put down her books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t work, I can’t concentrate,” she said nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  pressure  by  being  louder  and  more  exuberant  than  ever.  Oliver</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood  was  crouched  over  a  model  of  a  Quidditch  field  in  the  corner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">prodding  little  figures  across  it  with  his  wand  and  muttering  to  himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>Angelina,  Alicia,  and  Katie  were  laughing  at  Fred’s  and  George’s  jokes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  sitting  with  Ron  and  Hermione,  removed  from  the  center  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he did, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re  going  to  be  fine,”  Hermione  told  him,  though  she  looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">positively terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got a  <i class="calibre3">Firebolt</i>!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah … ,” said Harry, his stomach writhing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  came  as  a  relief  when  Wood  suddenly  stood  up  and  yelled,  “Team! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  yelling,  “Where  were  you?  We  had  to  use  Neville  instead!”  Then  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreamed  that  Malfoy  and  the  rest  of  the  Slytherin  team  arrived  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a</p>
<p class="calibre1">spurt  of  flames  from  Malfoy’s  steed’s  mouth,  when  he  realized  he  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  few  seconds  before  Harry  remembered  that  the  match  hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken  place  yet,  that  he  was  safe  in  bed,  and  that  the  Slytherin  team</p>
<p class="calibre1">definitely  wouldn’t  be  allowed  to  play  on  dragons.  He  was  feeling  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to pour</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  grounds  were  still  and  quiet.  No  breath  of  wind  disturbed  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">treetops  in  the  Forbidden  Forest;  the  Whomping  Willow  was  motionless</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  innocent-looking.  It  looked  as  though  the  conditions  for  the  match</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be perfect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  set  down  his  goblet  and  was  about  to  turn  back  to  his  bed  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">silvery lawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them</p>
<p class="calibre1">on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn’t be the Grim — not now —</p>
<p class="calibre1">not right before the match —</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  peered  out  at  the  grounds  again  and,  after  a  minute’s  frantic</p>
<p class="calibre1">searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now. … It wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Grim at all … it was a cat. … Harry clutched the window ledge in relief</p>
<p class="calibre1">as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks. …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>Or   <i class="calibre3">was</i>  it  only  Crookshanks?  Harry  squinted,  pressing  his  nose  flat</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  just  then,  it  emerged  —  a  gigantic,  shaggy  black  dog,  moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">stealthily  across  the  lawn,  Crookshanks  trotting  at  its  side.  Harry  stared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it</p>
<p class="calibre1">be an omen of Harry’s death? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron!” Harry hissed. “Ron! Wake up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need you to tell me if you can see something!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“S’all dark, Harry,” Ron muttered thickly. “What’re you on about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Down here —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked quickly back out of the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks  and  the  dog  had  vanished.  Harry  climbed  onto  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">windowsill  to  look  right  down  into  the  shadows  of  the  castle,  but  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">weren’t there. Where had they gone? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next</p>
<p class="calibre1">day to enormous applause. Harry couldn’t help grinning broadly as he saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  both  the  Ravenclaw  and  Hufflepuff  tables  were  applauding  them  too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked even paler than usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing  himself.  Then  he  hurried  them  off  to  the  field  before  anyone  else</p>
<p class="calibre1">had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Great Hall, everyone applauded again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good luck, Harry!” called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay  —  no  wind  to  speak  of  —  sun’s  a  bit  bright,  that  could  impair</p>
<p class="calibre1">your vision, watch out for it — ground’s fairly hard, good, that’ll give us a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast kickoff —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">school spilling onto the lawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Locker rooms,” said Wood tersely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None  of  them  spoke  as  they  changed  into  their  scarlet  robes.  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he’d eaten something</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at all, Wood</p>
<p class="calibre1">was saying, “Okay, it’s time, let’s go —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three-quarters of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  crowd  was  wearing  scarlet  rosettes,  waving  scarlet  flags  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like “GO</p>
<p class="calibre1">GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE CUP!” Behind the Slytherin goal</p>
<p class="calibre1">posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Slytherin  glittered  on  their  flags,  and  Professor  Snape  sat  in  the  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  here  are  the  Gryffindors!”  yelled  Lee  Jordan,  who  was  acting  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">commentator  as  usual.  “Potter,  Bell,  Johnson,  Spinnet,  Weasley,  Weasley, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good few years —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lee’s  comments  were  drowned  by  a  tide  of  “boos”  from  the  Slytherin</p>
<p class="calibre1">end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  here  come  the  Slytherin  team,  led  by  Captain  Flint.  He’s  made</p>
<p class="calibre1">some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a</p>
<p class="calibre1">point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them were enormous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captains, shake hands!” said Madam Hooch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flint  and  Wood  approached  each  other  and  grasped  each  other’s  hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">very  tightly;  it  looked  as  though  each  was  trying  to  break  the  other’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mount your brooms!” said Madam Hooch. “Three … two … one …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">brooms  rose  into  the  air.  Harry  felt  his  hair  fly  back  off  his  forehead;  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And it’s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of Gryffindor with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Argh,  no  —  Quaffle  intercepted  by  Warrington,  Warrington  of  Slytherin</p>
<p class="calibre1">tearing  up  the  field  —  WHAM!  —  nice  Bludger  work  there  by  George</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley,  Warrington  drops  the  Quaffle,  it’s  caught  by  —  Johnson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor  back  in  possession,  come  on,  Angelina  —  nice  swerve  around</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>Montague  —   <i class="calibre3">duck,  Angelina,  that’s  a  Bludger</i>!  —  SHE  SCORES!  TEN–</p>
<p class="calibre1">ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“OUCH!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angelina  was  nearly  thrown  from  her  broom  as  Marcus  Flint  went</p>
<p class="calibre1">smashing into her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry!” said Flint as the crowd below booed. “Sorry, didn’t see her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater’s club at the back of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flint’s head. Flint’s nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bleed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  will  do!”  shrieked  Madam  Hooch,  zooming  between  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Penalty  shot  to  Gryffindor  for  an  unprovoked  attack  on  their  Chaser! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to  <i class="calibre3">their</i> Chaser!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come off it, Miss!” howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Alicia flew forward to take the penalty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, Alicia!” yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crowd.  “YES!  SHE’S  BEATEN  THE  KEEPER!  TWENTY–ZERO  TO</p>
<p class="calibre1">GRYFFINDOR!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely, fly</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward  to  take  the  Slytherin  penalty.  Wood  was  hovering  in  front  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Course, Wood’s a superb Keeper!” Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint</p>
<p class="calibre1">waited for Madam Hooch’s whistle. “Superb! Very difficult to pass — very</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult indeed — YES! I DON’T BELIEVE IT! HE’S SAVED IT!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relieved,  Harry  zoomed  away,  gazing  around  for  the  Snitch,  but  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">making  sure  he  caught  every  word  of  Lee’s  commentary.  It  was  essential</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  he  hold  Malfoy  off  the  Snitch  until  Gryffindor  was  more  than  fifty</p>
<p class="calibre1">points up —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gryffindor  in  possession,  no,  Slytherin  in  possession  —  no!  —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  Quaffle,  she’s  streaking  up  the  field  —  THAT  WAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">DELIBERATE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead</p>
<p class="calibre1">of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cartwheeled in the air, </p>
<p class="calibre1">managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>Madam Hooch’s whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  began  shouting  at  him.  A  minute  later,  Katie  had  put  another  penalty</p>
<p class="calibre1">past the Slytherin Seeker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“THIRTY–ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way — !” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m telling it like it is, Professor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  felt  a  huge  jolt  of  excitement.  He  had  seen  the  Snitch  —  it  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch it yet — and if Malfoy saw it —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  sped  off  toward  the  Slytherin  end  —  it  worked.  Malfoy  went  haring</p>
<p class="calibre1">after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">WHOOSH. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  Bludgers  came  streaking  past  Harry’s  right  ear,  hit  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again —</p>
<p class="calibre1">WHOOSH. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second Bludger grazed Harry’s elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">closing in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">clubs raised —</p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick</p>
<p class="calibre1">collided with a sickening crunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from</p>
<p class="calibre1">each  other,  clutching  their  heads.  “Too  bad,  boys!  You’ll  need  to  get  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it’s Gryffindor in possession again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside her — poke him in the eye, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angelina!  —  it  was  a  joke,  Professor,  it  was  a  joke  —  oh  no  —  Flint  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">possession,  Flint  flying  toward  the  Gryffindor  goal  posts,  come  on  now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood, save — !” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin</p>
<p class="calibre1">end,  and  Lee  swore  so  badly  that  Professor  McGonagall  tried  to  tug  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">magical megaphone away from him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won’t happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Gryffindor  had  taken  such  an  early  lead,  the  Slytherins  were  rapidly</p>
<p class="calibre1">resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his club and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>tried to say he’d thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wood  pulled  off  another  spectacular  save,  making  the  score  forty-ten  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Snitch  had  disappeared  again.  Malfoy  was  still  keeping  close  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it — once Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">was fifty points ahead —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around</p>
<p class="calibre1">her,  clubs  raised,  in  case  any  of  the  Slytherins  were  thinking  of  revenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bole  and  Derrick  took  advantage  of  Fred’s  and  George’s  absence  to  aim</p>
<p class="calibre1">both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the other, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam Hooch was beside herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS</p>
<p class="calibre1">WITHIN  THE  SCORING  AREA!”  she  shrieked  at  Bole  and  Derrick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gryffindor penalty!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  Angelina  scored.  Sixty-ten.  Moments  later,  Fred  Weasley  pelted  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized</p>
<p class="calibre1">it and put it through the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse — Gryffindor</p>
<p class="calibre1">was sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup</p>
<p class="calibre1">was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">soared  around  the  field,  high  above  the  rest  of  the  game,  with  Malfoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">speeding along behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Horrified,  he  looked  around.  Malfoy  had  thrown  himself  forward, </p>
<p class="calibre1">grabbed hold of the Firebolt’s tail, and was pulling it back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn’t reach — Malfoy was</p>
<p class="calibre1">panting  with  the  effort  of  holding  onto  the  Firebolt,  but  his  eyes  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">sparkling  maliciously.  He  had  achieved  what  he’d  wanted  to  do  —  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snitch had disappeared again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Penalty!  Penalty  to  Gryffindor!  I’ve  never  seen  such  tactics!”  Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nimbus Two Thousand and One. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>“YOU  CHEATING  SCUM!”  Lee  Jordan  was  howling  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall’s reach. “YOU FILTHY, </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHEATING B —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  McGonagall  didn’t  even  bother  to  tell  him  off.  She  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually shaking her finger in Malfoy’s direction, her hat had fallen off, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">she too was shouting furiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alicia  took  Gryffindor’s  penalty,  but  she  was  so  angry  she  missed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">several  feet.  The  Gryffindor  team  was  losing  concentration  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy’s foul on Harry, were being spurred on to</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater heights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal — Montague scores</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” Lee groaned. “Seventy-twenty to Gryffindor. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other. Harry wasn’t going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get out of it, Potter!” Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and</p>
<p class="calibre1">found Harry blocking him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Angelina  Johnson  gets  the  Quaffle  for  Gryffindor,  come  on,  Angelina, </p>
<p class="calibre1">COME ON!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  looked  around.  Every  single  Slytherin  player  apart  from  Malfoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper</p>
<p class="calibre1">— they were all going to block her —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  handle,  and  kicked  it  forward.  Like  a  bullet,  he  shot  toward  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slytherins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“AAAAAAARRRGH!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina’s way was</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“SHE  SCORES!  SHE  SCORES!  Gryffindor  leads  by  eighty  points  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt</p>
<p class="calibre1">in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  then  he  saw  something  to  make  his  heart  stand  still.  Malfoy  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above the grass</p>
<p class="calibre1">below, was a tiny, golden glimmer —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go!  Go!  Go!”  Harry  urged  his  broom.  He  was  gaining  on  Malfoy  —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>— he was at Malfoy’s ankles — he was level —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy’s arm out of the way and —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“YES!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden</p>
<p class="calibre1">ball  was  held  tight  in  his  fist,  beating  its  wings  hopelessly  against  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  Wood  was  speeding  toward  him,  half-blinded  by  tears;  he  seized</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt  two  large  thumps  as  Fred  and  George  hit  them;  then  Angelina’s, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alicia’s,  and  Katie’s  voices,  “<i class="calibre3">We’ve  won  the  Cup</i>!  <i class="calibre3">We’ve  won  the  Cup</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tangled  together  in  a  many-armed  hug,  the  Gryffindor  team  sank,  yelling</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoarsely, back to earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wave  upon  wave  of  crimson  supporters  was  pouring  over  the  barriers</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto  the  field.  Hands  were  raining  down  on  their  backs.  Harry  had  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the light, he saw Hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh beat</p>
<p class="calibre1">’em,  Harry,  yeh  beat  ’em!  Wait  till  I  tell  Buckbeak!”  There  was  Percy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">jumping  up  and  down  like  a  maniac,  all  dignity  forgotten.  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was</p>
<p class="calibre1">borne  toward  the  stands,  where  Dumbledore  stood  waiting  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous Quidditch Cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If only there had been a dementor around. … As a sobbing Wood passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world’s best Patronus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a><img src="index-229_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Professor Trelawney’s Prediction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  euphoria  at  finally  winning  the  Quidditch  Cup  lasted  at  least  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">days  became  cloudless  and  sultry,  and  all  anybody  felt  like  doing  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  iced  pumpkin  juice,  perhaps  playing  a  casual  game  of  Gobstones  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching  the  giant  squid  propel  itself  dreamily  across  the  surface  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they couldn’t. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing</p>
<p class="calibre1">around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">spotted  working;  they  were  about  to  take  their  O.W.L.s  (Ordinary</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his N.E.W.T.s (Nastily</p>
<p class="calibre1">Exhausting  Wizarding  Tests),  the  highest  qualification  Hogwarts  offered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  becoming  increasingly  edgy,  and  gave  very  severe  punishments  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact, the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy was Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend</p>
<p class="calibre1">several classes at once, but they couldn’t restrain themselves when they saw</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first column read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Monday</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">9</i>  <i class="calibre3">o’clock, Arithmancy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">9</i>  <i class="calibre3">o’clock, Transfiguration</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Lunch</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">1 o’clock, Charms</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">1</i>  <i class="calibre3">o’clock,  Ancient</i>  <i class="calibre3">Runes</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione?”  Ron  said  cautiously,  because  she  was  liable  to  explode</p>
<p class="calibre1">when interrupted these days. “Er — are you sure you’ve copied down these</p>
<p class="calibre1">times right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”  snapped  Hermione,  picking  up  the  exam  schedule  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">examining it. “Yes, of course I have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is  there  any  point  asking  how  you’re  going  to  sit  for  two  exams  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">once?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”  said  Hermione  shortly.  “Have  either  of  you  seen  my  copy  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Numerology and Gramatica</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,” said Ron, but very</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment around on her table, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking  for  the  book.  Just  then,  there  was  a  rustle  at  the  window  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedwig fluttered through it, a note clutched tight in her beak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s from Hagrid,” said Harry, ripping the note open. “Buckbeak’s appeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">— it’s set for the sixth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s  the  day  we  finish  our  exams,”  said  Hermione,  still  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">everywhere for her Arithmancy book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And they’re coming up here to do it,” said Harry, still reading from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">letter. “Someone from the Ministry of Magic and — and an executioner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked up, startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re  bringing  the  executioner  to  the  appeal!  But  that  sounds  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though they’ve already decided!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, it does,” said Harry slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They can’t!” Ron howled. “I’ve spent  <i class="calibre3">ages</i> reading up on stuff for him; </p>
<p class="calibre1">they can’t just ignore it all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee for the Disposal of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dangerous Creatures had had its mind made up for it by Mr. Malfoy. Draco, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  had  been  noticeably  subdued  since  Gryffindor’s  triumph  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>Quidditch  final,  seemed  to  regain  some  of  his  old  swagger  over  the  next</p>
<p class="calibre1">few  days.  From  sneering  comments  Harry  overheard,  Malfoy  was  certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak  was  going  to  be  killed,  and  seemed  thoroughly  pleased  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself  for  bringing  it  about.  It  was  all  Harry  could  do  to  stop  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">imitating Hermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these occasions. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">the worst thing of all was that they had no time or opportunity to go and see</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid,  because  the  strict  new  security  measures  had  not  been  lifted,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  didn’t  dare  retrieve  his  Invisibility  Cloak  from  below  the  one-eyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">witch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">*   *   *</p>
 <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Exam  week  began  and  an  unnatural  hush  fell  over  the  castle.  The  third</p>
<p class="calibre1">years  emerged  from  Transfiguration  at  lunchtime  on  Monday,  limp  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ashen-faced,  comparing  results  and  bemoaning  the  difficulty  of  the  tasks</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  had  been  set,  which  had  included  turning  a  teapot  into  a  tortoise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  irritated  the  rest  by  fussing  about  how  her  tortoise  had  looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">more like a turtle, which was the least of everyone else’s worries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mine still had a spout for a tail, what a nightmare. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were the tortoises  <i class="calibre3">supposed</i> to breathe steam?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  still  had  a  willow-patterned  shell,  d’you  think  that’ll  count  against</p>
<p class="calibre1">me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  after  a  hasty  lunch,  it  was  straight  back  upstairs  for  the  Charms</p>
<p class="calibre1">exam. Hermione had been right; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheering  Charms.  Harry  slightly  overdid  his  out  of  nerves  and  Ron,  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">was partnering him, ended up in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led</p>
<p class="calibre1">away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the charm</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself. After dinner, the students hurried back to their common rooms, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to relax, but to start studying for Care of Magical Creatures, Potions, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astronomy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid presided over the Care of Magical Creatures exam the following</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning with a very preoccupied air indeed; his heart didn’t seem to be in it</p>
<p class="calibre1">at all. He had provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms for the class, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">told them that to pass the test, their flobberworm had to still be alive at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end  of  one  hour.  As  flobberworms  flourished  best  if  left  to  their  own</p>
<p class="calibre1">devices, it was the easiest exam any of them had ever taken, and also gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” Hagrid told them, bending low on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretense of checking that Harry’s flobberworm was still alive. “Bin cooped</p>
<p class="calibre1">up too long. But still … we’ll know day after tomorrow — one way or the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try</p>
<p class="calibre1">as Harry might, he couldn’t get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape,  standing  watch  with  an  air  of  vindictive  pleasure,  scribbled</p>
<p class="calibre1">something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  came  Astronomy  at  midnight,  up  on  the  tallest  tower;  History  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic  on  Wednesday  morning,  in  which  Harry  scribbled  everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">Florean  Fortescue  had  ever  told  him  about  medieval  witch-hunts,  while</p>
<p class="calibre1">wishing he could have had one of Fortescue’s choco-nut sundaes with him</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  stifling  classroom.  Wednesday  afternoon  meant  Herbology,  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once</p>
<p class="calibre1">more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would all be over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  second  to  last  exam,  on  Thursday  morning,  was  Defense  Against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  to  wade  across  a  deep  paddling  pool  containing  a  grindylow,  cross  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh</p>
<p class="calibre1">while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk, then climb into an</p>
<p class="calibre1">old trunk and battle with a new boggart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,  Harry,”  Lupin  muttered  as  Harry  climbed  out  of  the  trunk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">grinning. “Full marks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flushed  with  his  success,  Harry  hung  around  to  watch  Ron  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione.  Ron  did  very  well  until  he  reached  the  hinkypunk,  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">successfully  confused  him  into  sinking  waist-high  into  the  quagmire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  did  everything  perfectly  until  she  reached  the  trunk  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione!” said Lupin, startled. “What’s the matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“P — P — Professor McGonagall!” Hermione gasped, pointing into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trunk. “Sh — she said I’d failed everything!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  took  a  little  while  to  calm  Hermione  down.  When  at  last  she  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a>was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione’s boggart, but an argument</p>
<p class="calibre1">was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello  there,  Harry!”  he  said.  “Just  had  an  exam,  I  expect?  Nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">finished?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lovely day,” said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. “Pity … pity …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  here  on  an  unpleasant  mission,  Harry.  The  Committee  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disposal  of  Dangerous  Creatures  required  a  witness  to  the  execution  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mad  hippogriff.  As  I  needed  to  visit  Hogwarts  to  check  on  the  Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation, I was asked to step in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does  that  mean  the  appeal’s  already  happened?”  Ron  interrupted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stepping forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, it’s scheduled for this afternoon,” said Fudge, looking curiously</p>
<p class="calibre1">at Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then  you  might  not  have  to  witness  an  execution  at  all!”  said  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">stoutly. “The hippogriff might get off!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind  him.  One  was  so  ancient  he  appeared  to  be  withering  before  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">very  eyes;  the  other  was  tall  and  strapping,  with  a  thin  black  mustache. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  gathered  that  they  were  representatives  of  the  Committee  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disposal  of  Dangerous  Creatures,  because  the  very  old  wizard  squinted</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward Hagrid’s cabin and said in a feeble voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">too old for this. … Two o’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  black-mustached  man  was  fingering  something  in  his  belt;  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged</p>
<p class="calibre1">him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why’d you stop me?” said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall</p>
<p class="calibre1">for lunch. “Did you see them? They’ve even got the axe ready! This isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">justice!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron,  your  dad  works  for  the  Ministry,  you  can’t  go  saying  things  like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that to his boss!” said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. “As long as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>Hagrid  keeps  his  head  this  time,  and  argues  his  case  properly,  they  can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibly execute Buckbeak. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry could tell Hermione didn’t really believe what she was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  around  them,  people  were  talking  excitedly  as  they  ate  their  lunch, </p>
<p class="calibre1">happily  anticipating  the  end  of  the  exams  that  afternoon,  but  Harry,  Ron, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn’t join in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  and  Ron’s  last  exam  was  Divination;  Hermione’s,  Muggle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  first  floor  and  Harry  and  Ron  proceeded  all  the  way  up  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventh,  where  many  of  their  class  were  sitting  on  the  spiral  staircase  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Trelawney’s  classroom,  trying  to  cram  in  a  bit  of  last-minute</p>
<p class="calibre1">studying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them as they went to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sit down next to him. He had his copy of  <i class="calibre3">Unfogging the Future</i> open on his</p>
<p class="calibre1">lap  at  the  pages  devoted  to  crystal  gazing.  “Have  either  of  you  ever  seen</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">anything</i> in a crystal ball?” he asked them unhappily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,” said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak’s appeal started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each</p>
<p class="calibre1">person  climbed  back  down  the  silver  ladder,  the  rest  of  the  class  hissed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did she ask? Was it okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they all refused to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She says the crystal ball’s told her that if I tell you, I’ll have a horrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">accident!” squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s  convenient,”  snorted  Ron.  “You  know,  I’m  starting  to  think</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was right about her” — he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhead — “she’s a right old fraud.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was now two o’clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wish she’d hurry up …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She  says  I’ve  got  all  the  makings  of  a  true  Seer,”  she  informed  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Ron. “I saw  <i class="calibre3">loads</i> of stuff. … Well, good luck!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ronald Weasley,” said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was</p>
<p class="calibre1">now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind across the grounds with Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,  after  about  twenty  minutes,  Ron’s  large  feet  reappeared  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ladder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’d it go?” Harry asked him, standing up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rubbish,”  said  Ron.  “Couldn’t  see  a  thing,  so  I  made  some  stuff  up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t think she was convinced, though. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meet  you  in  the  common  room,”  Harry  muttered  as  Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trelawney’s voice called, “Harry Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  the  clutter  of  chairs  and  tables  to  where  Professor  Trelawney  sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting for him before a large crystal ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would kindly gaze into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Orb. … Take your time, now … then tell me what you see within it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  bent  over  the  crystal  ball  and  stared,  stared  as  hard  as  he  could, </p>
<p class="calibre1">willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. “What do you see?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  heat  was  overpowering  and  his  nostrils  were  stinging  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">had just said, and decided to pretend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er —” said Harry, “a dark shape … um …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  does  it  resemble?”  whispered  Professor  Trelawney.  “Think,  now</p>
<p class="calibre1">…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A hippogriff,” he said firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed!”  whispered  Professor  Trelawney,  scribbling  keenly  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">parchment perched upon her knees. “My boy, you may well be seeing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">… Does the hippogriff appear to … have its head?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are  you  sure?”  Professor  Trelawney  urged  him.  “Are  you  quite  sure, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dear?  You  don’t  see  it  writhing  on  the  ground,  perhaps,  and  a  shadowy</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure raising an axe behind it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No blood? No weeping Hagrid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>“No!”  said  Harry  again,  wanting  more  than  ever  to  leave  the  room  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the heat. “It looks fine, it’s — flying away. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there. … A little disappointing … but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m sure you did your best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relieved,  Harry  got  up,  picked  up  his  bag  and  turned  to  go,  but  then  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">loud, harsh voice spoke behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“It will happen tonight.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  wheeled  around.  Professor  Trelawney  had  gone  rigid  in  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“S — sorry?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Professor  Trelawney  didn’t  seem  to  hear  him.  Her  eyes  started  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the hospital wing</p>
<p class="calibre1">—  and  then  Professor  Trelawney  spoke  again,  in  the  same  harsh  voice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">quite unlike her own:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“The  Dark  Lord  lies  alone  and  friendless,  abandoned  by  his  followers. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">…  the  servant  will  break  free  and  set  out  to  rejoin  his  master.  The  Dark</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible than</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">ever he was. Tonight … before midnight … the servant … will set out … to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">rejoin … his master. …” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor  Trelawney’s  head  fell  forward  onto  her  chest.  She  made  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney’s head snapped up again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  so  sorry,  dear  boy,”  she  said  dreamily,  “the  heat  of  the  day,  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know … I drifted off for a moment. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat there, staring at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there anything wrong, my dear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord’s going to rise again</p>
<p class="calibre1">… that his servant’s going to go back to him. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  Dark  Lord?  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?  My  dear  boy,  that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardly something to joke about. … Rise again, indeed —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you must have dozed off too, dear!” said Professor Trelawney. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  certainly  not  presume  to  predict  anything  quite  as  far-fetched  as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a> <i class="calibre3">that</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase, wondering</p>
<p class="calibre1">…  had  he  just  heard  Professor  Trelawney  make  a  real  prediction?  Or  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">that been her idea of an impressive end to the test? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five  minutes  later  he  was  dashing  past  the  security  trolls  outside  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney’s words still resounding</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  his  head.  People  were  striding  past  him  in  the  opposite  direction, </p>
<p class="calibre1">laughing  and  joking,  heading  for  the  grounds  and  a  bit  of  long-awaited</p>
<p class="calibre1">freedom;  by  the  time  he  had  reached  the  portrait  hole  and  entered  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner, however, sat Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Trelawney,” Harry panted, “just told me —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Buckbeak lost,” said Ron weakly. “Hagrid’s just sent this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Lost appeal. </i>  <i class="calibre3">They’re going to execute at sunset. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Nothing you can do. Don’t come down. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I don’t want you to see it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Hagrid</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got to go,” said Harry at once. “He can’t just sit there on his own, </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting for the executioner!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sunset, though,” said Ron, who was staring out the window in a glazed</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort of way. “We’d never be allowed … ’specially you, Harry. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If we only had the Invisibility Cloak. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is it?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  told  her  about  leaving  it  in  the  passageway  under  the  one-eyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">witch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“… if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m in serious trouble,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s true,” said Hermione, getting to her feet. “If he sees  <i class="calibre3">you</i>. … How</p>
<p class="calibre1">do you open the witch’s hump again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You — you tap it and say, ‘ <i class="calibre3">Dissendium, </i>’ ” said Harry. “But —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>Hermione  didn’t  wait  for  the  rest  of  his  sentence;  she  strode  across  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room, pushed open the Fat Lady’s portrait and vanished from sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She hasn’t gone to get it?” Ron said, staring after her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  had.  Hermione  returned  a  quarter  of  an  hour  later  with  the  silvery</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloak folded carefully under her robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,  I  don’t  know  what’s  gotten  into  you  lately!”  said  Ron, </p>
<p class="calibre1">astounded. “First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked rather flattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">They  went  down  to  dinner  with  everybody  else,  but  did  not  return  to</p>
