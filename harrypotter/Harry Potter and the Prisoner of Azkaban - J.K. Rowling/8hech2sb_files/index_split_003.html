<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down the front of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They skulked in</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  empty  chamber  off  the  entrance  hall,  listening,  until  they  were  sure  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">door slamming. Hermione poked her head around the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” she whispered, “no one there — cloak on —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front steps</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden Forest, </p>
<p class="calibre1">gilding the top branches of the trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  reached  Hagrid’s  cabin  and  knocked.  He  was  a  minute  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">answering, and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">and trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s us,” Harry hissed. “We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and we can take it off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid  was  not  crying,  nor  did  he  throw  himself  upon  their  necks.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked  like  a  man  who  did  not  know  where  he  was  or  what  to  do.  This</p>
<p class="calibre1">helplessness was worse to watch than tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wan’ some tea?” he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the kettle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Buckbeak, Hagrid?” said Hermione hesitantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — I took him outside,” said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  filled  up  the  jug.  “He’s  tethered  in  me  pumpkin  patch.  Thought  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">oughta see the trees an’ — an’ smell fresh air — before —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>Hagrid’s  hand  trembled  so  violently  that  the  milk  jug  slipped  from  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">grasp and shattered all over the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll do it, Hagrid,” said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean up the mess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  another  one  in  the  cupboard,”  Hagrid  said,  sitting  down  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopelessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t  there  anything  anyone  can  do,  Hagrid?”  Harry  asked  fiercely, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting down next to him. “Dumbledore —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  tried,”  said  Hagrid.  “He’s  got  no  power  ter  overrule  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Committee.  He  told  ’em  Buckbeak’s  all  right,  but  they’re  scared.  …  Yeh</p>
<p class="calibre1">know  what  Lucius  Malfoy’s  like  …  threatened  ’em,  I  expect  …  an’  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">executioner, Macnair, he’s an old pal o’ Malfoy’s … but it’ll be quick an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean … an’ I’ll be beside him. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid  swallowed.  His  eyes  were  darting  all  over  the  cabin  as  though</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking for some shred of hope or comfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore’s gonna come down while it — while it happens. Wrote me</p>
<p class="calibre1">this mornin’. Said he wants ter — ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione,  who  had  been  rummaging  in  Hagrid’s  cupboard  for  another</p>
<p class="calibre1">milk jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new jug in her hands, fighting back tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll  stay  with  you  too,  Hagrid,”  she  began,  but  Hagrid  shook  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaggy head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh’re  ter  go  back  up  ter  the  castle.  I  told  yeh,  I  don’  wan’  yeh</p>
<p class="calibre1">watchin’.  An’  yeh  shouldn’  be  down  here  anyway.  …  If  Fudge  an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore  catch  yeh  out  without  permission,  Harry,  yeh’ll  be  in  big</p>
<p class="calibre1">trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione’s face, but she hid them</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron! I — I don’t believe it — it’s  <i class="calibre3">Scabbers</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron gaped at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you talking about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  carried  the  milk  jug  over  to  the  table  and  turned  it  upside</p>
<p class="calibre1">down.  With  a  frantic  squeak,  and  much  scrambling  to  get  back  inside, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>“Scabbers!” said Ron blankly. “Scabbers, what are you doing here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  grabbed  the  struggling  rat  and  held  him  up  to  the  light.  Scabbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving  wide  bald  patches,  and  he  writhed  in  Ron’s  hands  as  though</p>
<p class="calibre1">desperate to free himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  okay,  Scabbers!”  said  Ron.  “No  cats!  There’s  nothing  here  to  hurt</p>
<p class="calibre1">you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid  suddenly  stood  up,  his  eyes  fixed  on  the  window.  His  normally</p>
<p class="calibre1">ruddy face had gone the color of parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re comin’. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">down  the  distant  castle  steps.  In  front  was  Albus  Dumbledore,  his  silver</p>
<p class="calibre1">beard  gleaming  in  the  dying  sun.  Next  to  him  trotted  Cornelius  Fudge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Macnair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh  gotta  go,”  said  Hagrid.  Every  inch  of  him  was  trembling.  “They</p>
<p class="calibre1">mustn’ find yeh here. … Go now. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll let yeh out the back way,” said Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely</p>
<p class="calibre1">unreal,  and  even  more  so  when  he  saw  Buckbeak  a  few  yards  away, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tethered  to  a  tree  behind  Hagrid’s  pumpkin  patch.  Buckbeak  seemed  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side</p>
<p class="calibre1">and pawed the ground nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay, Beaky,” said Hagrid softly. “It’s okay …” He turned to Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, and Hermione. “Go on,” he said. “Get goin’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they didn’t move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid, we can’t —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll tell them what really happened —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They can’t kill him —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go!”  said  Hagrid  fiercely.  “It’s  bad  enough  without  you  lot  in  trouble</p>
<p class="calibre1">an’ all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where</p>
<p class="calibre1">they had just vanished from sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go quick,” he said hoarsely. “Don’ listen. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>Slowly,  in  a  kind  of  horrified  trance,  Harry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  set  off</p>
<p class="calibre1">silently  around  Hagrid’s  house.  As  they  reached  the  other  side,  the  front</p>
<p class="calibre1">door closed with a sharp snap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, let’s hurry,” Hermione whispered. “I can’t stand it, I can’t bear</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was a ruby-red glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron stopped dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, please, Ron,” Hermione began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going  berserk;  squeaking  madly,  twisting  and  flailing,  trying  to  sink  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">teeth into Ron’s hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scabbers, it’s me, you idiot, it’s Ron,” Ron hissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They heard a door open behind them and men’s voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Ron, please let’s move, they’re going to do it!” Hermione breathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay — Scabbers, stay  <i class="calibre3">put</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t hold him — Scabbers, shut up, everyone’ll hear us —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rat  was  squealing  wildly,  but  not  loudly  enough  to  cover  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds drifting from Hagrid’s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices,  a  silence,  and  then,  without  warning,  the  unmistakable  swish  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thud of an axe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione swayed on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They did it!” she whispered to Harry. “I d — don’t believe it — they did</p>
<p class="calibre1">it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a><img src="index-242_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Cat, Rat, and Dog</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  mind  had  gone  blank  with  shock.  The  three  of  them  stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">setting  sun  were  casting  a  bloody  light  over  the  long-shadowed  grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid,” Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t,” said Ron, who was paper-white. “He’ll be in worse trouble if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they know we’ve been to see him. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s breathing was shallow and uneven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How — could — they?” she choked. “How  <i class="calibre3">could</i> they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on,” said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">hidden  under  the  cloak.  The  light  was  fading  fast  now.  By  the  time  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell around them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scabbers, keep still,” Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">rat  was  wriggling  madly.  Ron  came  to  a  sudden  halt,  trying  to  force</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers  deeper  into  his  pocket.  “What’s  the  matter  with  you,  you  stupid</p>
<p class="calibre1">rat? Stay still — OUCH! He bit me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, be quiet!” Hermione whispered urgently. “Fudge’ll be out here in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">minute —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>“He won’t — stay — put —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might, trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to break free of Ron’s grip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the  <i class="calibre3">matter</i> with him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Harry  had  just  seen  —  slinking  toward  them,  his  body  low  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground,  wide  yellow  eyes  glinting  eerily  in  the  darkness  —  Crookshanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether  he  could  see  them  or  was  following  the  sound  of  Scabbers’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">squeaks, Harry couldn’t tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crookshanks!”  Hermione  moaned.  “No,  go  away,  Crookshanks!  Go</p>
<p class="calibre1">away!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the cat was getting nearer —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scabbers — NO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too late — the rat had slipped between Ron’s clutching fingers, hit the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  before  Harry  or  Hermione  could  stop  him,  Ron  had  thrown  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Ron</i>!” Hermione moaned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  and  Harry  looked  at  each  other,  then  followed  at  a  sprint;  it  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could hear his feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come  <i class="calibre3">here</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a loud thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Gotcha</i>! Get off, you stinking cat —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron  —  come  on  —  back  under  the  cloak  —”  Hermione  panted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore — the Minister — they’ll be coming back out in a minute —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  before  they  could  cover  themselves  again,  before  they  could  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch  their  breath,  they  heard  the  soft  pounding  of  gigantic  paws.  …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow — an enormous, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pale-eyed, jet-black dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  reached  for  his  wand,  but  too  late  —  the  dog  had  made  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous  leap  and  the  front  paws  hit  him  on  the  chest;  he  keeled  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth —</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling  as  though  his  ribs  were  broken,  Harry  tried  to  stand  up;  he  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  was  on  his  feet.  As  the  dog  sprang  back  toward  them  he  pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry aside; the dog’s jaws fastened instead around Ron’s outstretched arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  lunged  forward,  he  seized  a  handful  of  the  brute’s  hair,  but  it  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Lumos</i>!” he whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  wandlight  showed  him  the  trunk  of  a  thick  tree;  they  had  chased</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were</p>
<p class="calibre1">creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop</p>
<p class="calibre1">them going nearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward</p>
<p class="calibre1">into a large gap in the roots — Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and</p>
<p class="calibre1">torso were slipping out of sight —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron!”  Harry  shouted,  trying  to  follow,  but  a  heavy  branch  whipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">lethally through the air and he was forced backward again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  they  could  see  now  was  one  of  Ron’s  legs,  which  he  had  hooked</p>
<p class="calibre1">around  a  root  in  an  effort  to  stop  the  dog  from  pulling  him  farther</p>
<p class="calibre1">underground — but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron’s leg had</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry  —  we’ve  got  to  go  for  help  —”  Hermione  gasped;  she  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bleeding too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No! That thing’s big enough to eat him; we haven’t got time —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry — we’re never going to get through without help —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If  that  dog  can  get  in,  we  can,”  Harry  panted,  darting  here  and  there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">get  an  inch  nearer  to  the  tree  roots  without  being  in  range  of  the  tree’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">blows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, help, help,” Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spot, “please …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a>Abruptly,  as  though  the  tree  had  been  turned  to  marble,  it  stopped</p>
<p class="calibre1">moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crookshanks!”  Hermione  whispered  uncertainly.  She  now  grasped</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s arm painfully hard. “How did he know — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s friends with that dog,” said Harry grimly. “I’ve seen them together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come on — and keep your wand out —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  covered  the  distance  to  the  trunk  in  seconds,  but  before  they  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottlebrush  tail.  Harry  went  next;  he  crawled  forward,  headfirst,  and  slid</p>
<p class="calibre1">down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry’s wand. Seconds</p>
<p class="calibre1">later, Hermione slithered down beside him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This way,” said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where  does  this  tunnel  come  out?”  Hermione  asked  breathlessly  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  know.  …  It’s  marked  on  the  Marauder’s  Map  but  Fred  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">George said no one’s ever gotten into it. … It goes off the edge of the map, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  moved  as  fast  as  they  could,  bent  almost  double;  ahead  of  them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks’s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the passage; </p>
<p class="calibre1">it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes. … All Harry could think of</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  Ron  and  what  the  enormous  dog  might  be  doing  to  him.  …  He  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">And  then  the  tunnel  began  to  rise;  moments  later  it  twisted,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks  had  gone.  Instead,  Harry  could  see  a  patch  of  dim  light</p>
<p class="calibre1">through a small opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  and  Hermione  paused,  gasping  for  breath,  edging  forward.  Both</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised their wands to see what lay beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls;  there  were  stains  all  over  the  floor;  every  piece  of  furniture  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all boarded</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  pulled  himself  out  of  the  hole,  staring  around.  The  room  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a>Hermione  suddenly  grabbed  Harry’s  arm  again.  Her  wide  eyes  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">traveling around the boarded windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking Shack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large</p>
<p class="calibre1">chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ghosts didn’t do that,” he said slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  that  moment,  there  was  a  creak  overhead.  Something  had  moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione’s grip on Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">arm  was  so  tight  he  was  losing  feeling  in  his  fingers.  He  raised  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  a  wide  shiny  stripe  had  been  made  by  something  being  dragged</p>
<p class="calibre1">upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They reached the dark landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Nox, </i>” they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands</p>
<p class="calibre1">went  out.  Only  one  door  was  open.  As  they  crept  toward  it,  they  heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">exchanged a last look, a last nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching his</p>
<p class="calibre1">leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione dashed across to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron — are you okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s the dog?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. “Harry, it’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trap —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">He’s the dog</i> …  <i class="calibre3">he’s an Animagus. …</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  was  staring  over  Harry’s  shoulder.  Harry  wheeled  around.  With  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  mass  of  filthy,  matted  hair  hung  to  his  elbows.  If  eyes  hadn’t  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">shining  out  of  the  deep,  dark  sockets,  he  might  have  been  a  corpse.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked like</p>
<p class="calibre1">a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expelliarmus</i>!” he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>Harry’s  and  Hermione’s  wands  shot  out  of  their  hands,  high  in  the  air, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said hoarsely. His voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it. “Your father</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have done the same for me. Brave of you, not to run for a teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m grateful … it will make everything much easier. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  taunt  about  his  father  rang  in  Harry’s  ears  as  though  Black  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">bellowed  it.  A  boiling  hate  erupted  in  Harry’s  chest,  leaving  no  place  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  defend  himself,  but  to  attack  …  to  kill.  Without  knowing  what  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement on either side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  him  and  two  pairs  of  hands  grabbed  him  and  held  him  back.  …  “No, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry!”  Hermione  gasped  in  a  petrified  whisper;  Ron,  however,  spoke  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If  you  want  to  kill  Harry,  you’ll  have  to  kill  us  too!”  he  said  fiercely, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and he swayed slightly as he spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lie  down,”  he  said  quietly  to  Ron.  “You  will  damage  that  leg  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you hear me?” Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Harry to stay upright. “You’ll have to kill all three of us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’ll  be  only  one  murder  here  tonight,”  said  Black,  and  his  grin</p>
<p class="calibre1">widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why’s  that?”  Harry  spat,  trying  to  wrench  himself  free  of  Ron  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione.  “Didn’t  care  last  time,  did  you?  Didn’t  mind  slaughtering  all</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  Muggles  to  get  at  Pettigrew.  …  What’s  the  matter,  gone  soft  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Azkaban?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” Hermione whimpered. “Be quiet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HE  KILLED  MY  MUM  AND  DAD!”  Harry  roared,  and  with  a  huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">effort he broke free of Hermione’s and Ron’s restraint and lunged forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that he was short and</p>
<p class="calibre1">skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man — all Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew  was  that  he  wanted  to  hurt  Black  as  badly  as  he  could  and  that  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t care how much he got hurt in return —</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t  raise  the  wands  in  time  —  one  of  Harry’s  hands  fastened  over  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasted  wrist,  forcing  the  wand  tips  away;  the  knuckles  of  Harry’s  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand collided with the side of Black’s head and they fell, backward, into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  wands  in  Black’s  hand  sent  a  jet  of  sparks  into  the  air  that  missed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  face  by  inches;  Harry  felt  the  shrunken  arm  under  his  fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">twisting  madly,  but  he  clung  on,  his  other  hand  punching  every  part  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black it could find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Black’s free hand had found Harry’s throat —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  he  saw  Hermione’s  foot  swing  out  of  nowhere.  Black  let  go  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black’s wand hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Harry heard a faint clatter —</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  fought  free  of  the  tangle  of  bodies  and  saw  his  own  wand  rolling</p>
<p class="calibre1">across the floor; he threw himself toward it but —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Argh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks  had  joined  the  fray;  both  sets  of  front  claws  had  sunk</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  deep  into  Harry’s  arm;  Harry  threw  him  off,  but  Crookshanks</p>
<p class="calibre1">now darted toward Harry’s wand —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO YOU DON’T!” roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  made  the  cat  leap  aside,  spitting;  Harry  snatched  up  his  wand  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get out of the way!” he shouted at Ron and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  didn’t  need  telling  twice.  Hermione,  gasping  for  breath,  her  lip</p>
<p class="calibre1">bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron’s wands. Ron crawled</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged</p>
<p class="calibre1">with green, both hands clutching his broken leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">rapidly  as  he  watched  Harry  walking  slowly  nearer,  his  wand  pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight at Black’s heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black’s chest, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black’s left eye and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his nose was bleeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a>“You  killed  my  parents,”  said  Harry,  his  voice  shaking  slightly,  but  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand hand quite steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t deny it,” he said very quietly. “But if you knew the whole story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The whole story?” Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">sold them to Voldemort. That’s all I need to know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got to listen to me,” Black said, and there was a note of urgency</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  his  voice  now.  “You’ll  regret  it  if  you  don’t.  …  You  don’t  understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand a lot better than you think,” said Harry, and his voice shook</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than ever. “You never heard her, did you? My mum … trying to stop</p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort killing me … and you did that … you did it. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked</p>
<p class="calibre1">past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black’s chest and settled himself there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">right over Black’s heart. Black blinked and looked down at the cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get off,” he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Crookshanks  sank  his  claws  into  Black’s  robes  and  wouldn’t  shift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those</p>
<p class="calibre1">great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league with Black. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">If  it  was  prepared  to  die,  trying  to  protect  Black,  that  wasn’t  Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">business. … If Black wanted to save it, that only proved he cared more for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks than for Harry’s parents. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  raised  the  wand.  Now  was  the  moment  to  do  it.  Now  was  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment  to  avenge  his  mother  and  father.  He  was  going  to  kill  Black.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had to kill Black. This was his chance. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron’s ragged breathing</p>
<p class="calibre1">came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then came a new sound —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muffled  footsteps  were  echoing  up  through  the  floor  —  someone  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">moving downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WE’RE UP HERE!” Hermione screamed suddenly. “WE’RE UP HERE</p>
<p class="calibre1">— SIRIUS BLACK —  <i class="calibre3">QUICK</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  made  a  startled  movement  that  almost  dislodged  Crookshanks; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry gripped his wand convulsively —  <i class="calibre3">Do it now</i>! said a voice in his head</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>—  but  the  footsteps  were  thundering  up  the  stairs  and  Harry  still  hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">done it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  door  of  the  room  burst  open  in  a  shower  of  red  sparks  and  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">wheeled  around  as  Professor  Lupin  came  hurtling  into  the  room,  his  face</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  floor,  over  Hermione,  cowering  next  to  the  door,  to  Harry,  standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">there  with  his  wand  covering  Black,  and  then  to  Black  himself,  crumpled</p>
<p class="calibre1">and bleeding at Harry’s feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expelliarmus</i>!” Lupin shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  holding.  Lupin  caught  them  all  deftly,  then  moved  into  the  room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">staring  at  Black,  who  still  had  Crookshanks  lying  protectively  across  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn’t done it. His nerve</p>
<p class="calibre1">had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is he, Sirius?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn’t understand what Lupin meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn’t move</p>
<p class="calibre1">at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then … ,” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was trying to read his mind, “… why hasn’t he shown himself before now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless”  —  Lupin’s  eyes  suddenly  widened,  as  though  he  was  seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, “— unless</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">he</i> was the one … unless you switched … without telling me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin’s face, Black nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor,” Harry interrupted loudly, “what’s going on — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixedly at Black. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor walked to Black’s side, seized his hand, pulled him to his feet so</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I DON’T BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  let  go  of  Black  and  turned  to  her.  She  had  raised  herself  off  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. “You — you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>“Hermione —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ — you and him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, calm down —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  didn’t  tell  anyone!”  Hermione  shrieked.  “I’ve  been  covering  up  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, listen to me, please!” Lupin shouted. “I can explain —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering out of control, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“and all the time you’ve been his friend!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re wrong,” said Lupin. “I haven’t been Sirius’s friend, but I am now</p>
<p class="calibre1">— Let me explain. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO!”  Hermione  screamed.  “Harry,  don’t  trust  him,  he’s  been  helping</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too —  <i class="calibre3">he’s a werewolf</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a ringing silence. Everyone’s eyes were now on Lupin, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked remarkably calm, though rather pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he said. “Only one out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of three, I’m afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly  don’t  want  Harry  dead.  …”  An  odd  shiver  passed  over  his  face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I won’t deny that I am a werewolf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of</p>
<p class="calibre1">pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Get away from me, werewolf</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">and said, “How long have you known?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ages,” Hermione whispered. “Since I did Professor Snape’s essay. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll be delighted,” said Lupin coolly. “He assigned that essay hoping</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone  would  realize  what  my  symptoms  meant.  …  Did  you  check  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lunar  chart  and  realize  that  I  was  always  ill  at  the  full  moon?  Or  did  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Both,” Hermione said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin forced a laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met, Hermione.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not,” Hermione whispered. “If I’d been a bit cleverer, I’d have told</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone what you are!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But they already know,” said Lupin. “At least, the staff do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>“Dumbledore  hired  you  when  he  knew  you  were  a  werewolf?”  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">gasped. “Is he mad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some of the staff thought so,” said Lupin. “He had to work very hard to</p>
<p class="calibre1">convince certain teachers that I’m trustworthy —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“AND HE WAS WRONG!” Harry yelled. “YOU’VE BEEN HELPING</p>
<p class="calibre1">HIM ALL THE TIME!” He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks  leapt  up  beside  him  and  stepped  onto  his  lap,  purring.  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">edged away from both of them, dragging his leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have  <i class="calibre3">not</i> been helping Sirius,” said Lupin. “If you’ll give me a chance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll explain. Look —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He separated Harry’s, Ron’s and Hermione’s wands and threw each back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,”  said  Lupin,  sticking  his  own  wand  back  into  his  belt.  “You’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">armed, we’re not. Now will you listen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t know what to think. Was it a trick? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If  you  haven’t  been  helping  him,”  he  said,  with  a  furious  glance  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black, “how did you know he was here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  map,”  said  Lupin.  “The  Marauder’s  Map.  I  was  in  my  office</p>
<p class="calibre1">examining it —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of  course  I  know  how  to  work  it,”  said  Lupin,  waving  his  hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">impatiently.  “I  helped  write  it.  I’m  Moony  —  that  was  my  friends’</p>
<p class="calibre1">nickname for me at school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  <i class="calibre3">wrote</i> — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  started  to  pace  up  and  down,  looking  at  them.  Little  patches  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dust rose at his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You might have been wearing your father’s old cloak, Harry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How d’you know about the cloak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The number of times I saw James disappearing under it… ,” said Lupin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">waving an impatient hand again. “The point is, even if you’re wearing an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s Map. I watched you</p>
<p class="calibre1">cross  the  grounds  and  enter  Hagrid’s  hut.  Twenty  minutes  later,  you  left</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p253"></a>Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied</p>
<p class="calibre1">by somebody else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  couldn’t  believe  my  eyes,”  said  Lupin,  still  pacing,  and  ignoring</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  interruption.  “I  thought  the  map  must  be  malfunctioning.  How</p>
<p class="calibre1">could he be with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one was with us!” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  then  I  saw  another  dot,  moving  fast  toward  you,  labeled   <i class="calibre3">Sirius</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Black. …</i> I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Whomping Willow —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One of us!” Ron said angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Ron,” said Lupin. “Two of you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think I could have a look at the rat?” he said evenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Ron. “What’s Scabbers got to do with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything,” said Lupin. “Could I see him, please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  hesitated,  then  put  a  hand  inside  his  robes.  Scabbers  emerged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thrashing  desperately;  Ron  had  to  seize  his  long  bald  tail  to  stop  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaping.  Crookshanks  stood  up  on  Black’s  leg  and  made  a  soft  hissing</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  moved  closer  to  Ron.  He  seemed  to  be  holding  his  breath  as  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">gazed intently at Scabbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s my rat got to do with anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not a rat,” croaked Sirius Black suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, he’s not,” said Lupin quietly. “He’s a wizard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An Animagus,” said Black, “by the name of Peter Pettigrew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a><img src="index-254_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Prongs</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron voiced what Harry was thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re both mental.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ridiculous!” said Hermione faintly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peter Pettigrew’s  <i class="calibre3">dead</i>!” said Harry. “<i class="calibre3">He</i> killed him twelve years ago!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I meant to,” he growled, his yellow teeth bared, “but little Peter got the</p>
<p class="calibre1">better of me … not this time, though!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron yelled with pain as Black’s weight fell on his broken leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius,  NO!”  Lupin  yelled,  launching  himself  forwards  and  dragging</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black away from Ron again, “WAIT! You can’t do it just like that — they</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to understand — we’ve got to explain —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  can  explain  afterwards!”  snarled  Black,  trying  to  throw  Lupin  off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  hand  was  still  clawing  the  air  as  it  tried  to  reach  Scabbers,  who  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron’s face and neck as he tried to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve  —  got  —  a  —  right  —  to  —  know  —  everything!”  Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">panted,  still  trying  to  restrain  Black.  “Ron’s  kept  him  as  a  pet!  There  are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a>parts of it even I don’t understand! And Harry — you owe Harry the truth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  stopped  struggling,  though  his  hollowed  eyes  were  still  fixed  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers,  who  was  clamped  tightly  under  Ron’s  bitten,  scratched,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bleeding hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All  right,  then,”  Black  said,  without  taking  his  eyes  off  the  rat.  “Tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the</p>
<p class="calibre1">murder I was imprisoned for. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re nutters, both of you,” said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Hermione for support. “I’ve had enough of this. I’m off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, pointing it at Scabbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re  going  to  hear  me  out,  Ron,”  he  said  quietly.  “Just  keep  a  tight</p>
<p class="calibre1">hold on Peter while you listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HE’S NOT PETER, HE’S SCABBERS!” Ron yelled, trying to force the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rat  back  into  his  front  pocket,  but  Scabbers  was  fighting  too  hard;  Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">swayed  and  overbalanced,  and  Harry  caught  him  and  pushed  him  back</p>
<p class="calibre1">down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,” he said. “A whole street</p>
<p class="calibre1">full of them …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They didn’t see what they thought they saw!” said Black savagely, still</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching Scabbers struggling in Ron’s hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,” said Lupin, nodding. “I believed</p>
<p class="calibre1">it myself — until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder’s map never</p>
<p class="calibre1">lies … Peter’s alive. Ron’s holding him, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatsoever.  How  could  Scabbers  be  Peter  Pettigrew?  Azkaban  must  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">unhinged Black after all — but why was Lupin playing along with him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  Hermione  spoke,  in  a  trembling,  would-be  calm  sort  of  voice,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Professor Lupin … Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew … it just can’t be</p>
<p class="calibre1">true, you know it can’t …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why can’t it be true?” Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hermione  had  simply  spotted  a  problem  in  an  experiment  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">grindylows. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>“Because … because people would  <i class="calibre3">know</i> if Peter Pettigrew had been an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Animagus.  We  did  Animagi  in  class  with  Professor  McGonagall.  And  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps</p>
<p class="calibre1">tabs  on  witches  and  wizards  who  can  become  animals;  there’s  a  register</p>
<p class="calibre1">showing what animal they become, and their markings and things … and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew’s name wasn’t on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">list —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put</p>
<p class="calibre1">into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh. “Right again, Hermione!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  said.  “But  the  Ministry  never  knew  that  there  used  to  be  three</p>
<p class="calibre1">unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you’re going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,” snarled</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black,  who  was  still  watching  Scabbers’s  every  desperate  move.  “I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">waited twelve years, I’m not going to wait much longer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All  right  …  but  you’ll  need  to  help  me,  Sirius,”  said  Lupin,  “I  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">know how it began …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom</p>
<p class="calibre1">door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">strode toward it and looked out into the landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one there …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This place is haunted!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  not,”  said  Lupin,  still  looking  at  the  door  in  a  puzzled  way.  “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shrieking  Shack  was  never  haunted.  …  The  screams  and  howls  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">villagers used to hear were made by me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">said, “That’s where all of this starts — with my becoming a werewolf. None</p>
<p class="calibre1">of this could have happened if I hadn’t been bitten … and if I hadn’t been</p>
<p class="calibre1">so foolhardy. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  looked  sober  and  tired.  Ron  started  to  interrupt,  but  Hermione  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh!” She was watching Lupin very intently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  was  a  very  small  boy  when  I  received  the  bite.  My  parents  tried</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you see. As long as I take it in the week preceding the full moon, I keep my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind  when  I  transform.  …  I  am  able  to  curl  up  in  my  office,  a  harmless</p>
<p class="calibre1">wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>“Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come  to  Hogwarts.  Other  parents  weren’t  likely  to  want  their  children</p>
<p class="calibre1">exposed to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">said  that  as  long  as  we  took  certain  precautions,  there  was  no  reason  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldn’t come to school. …” Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">told  you,  months  ago,  that  the  Whomping  Willow  was  planted  the  year  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">came  to  Hogwarts.  The  truth  is  that  it  was  planted   <i class="calibre3">because</i>  I  came  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts. This house” — Lupin looked miserably around the room, — “the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use. Once a month, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  tunnel  mouth  to  stop  anyone  coming  across  me  while  I  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry couldn’t see where this story was going, but he was listening raptly</p>
<p class="calibre1">all  the  same.  The  only  sound  apart  from  Lupin’s  voice  was  Scabbers’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">frightened squeaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  transformations  in  those  days  were  —  were  terrible.  It  is  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  scratched  myself  instead.  The  villagers  heard  the  noise  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">screaming  and  thought  they  were  hearing  particularly  violent  spirits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. … Even now, when the house has been</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent for years, the villagers don’t dare approach it. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been</p>
<p class="calibre1">in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  …  Peter  Pettigrew  …  and,  of  course,  your  father,  Harry  —  James</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once</p>
<p class="calibre1">a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I had to go home to see her. … I was terrified they would desert me the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">worked out the truth. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And they didn’t desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">life. They became Animagi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dad too?” said Harry, astounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a>“Yes,  indeed,”  said  Lupin.  “It  took  them  the  best  part  of  three  years  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">work  out  how  to  do  it.  Your  father  and  Sirius  here  were  the  cleverest</p>
<p class="calibre1">students  in  the  school,  and  lucky  they  were,  because  the  Animagus</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformation  can  go  horribly  wrong  —  one  reason  the  Ministry  keeps  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could</p>
<p class="calibre1">get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">could each turn into a different animal at will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how did that help you?” said Hermione, sounding puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They couldn’t keep me company as humans, so they kept me company</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  animals,”  said  Lupin.  “A  werewolf  is  only  a  danger  to  people.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">sneaked  out  of  the  castle  every  month  under  James’s  Invisibility  Cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They transformed … Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip</p>
<p class="calibre1">down  the  tunnel  and  join  me.  Under  their  influence,  I  became  less</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less</p>
<p class="calibre1">so while I was with them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurry up, Remus,” snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a horrible sort of hunger on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  getting  there,  Sirius,  I’m  getting  there  …  well,  highly  exciting</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village</p>
<p class="calibre1">by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we</p>
<p class="calibre1">did. … And that’s how we came to write the Marauder’s Map, and sign it</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  our  nicknames.  Sirius  is  Padfoot.  Peter  is  Wormtail.  James  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prongs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What sort of animal — ?” Harry began, but Hermione cut him off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  was  still  really  dangerous!  Running  around  in  the  dark  with  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">werewolf! What if you’d given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A  thought  that  still  haunts  me,”  said  Lupin  heavily.  “And  there  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">near  misses,  many  of  them.  We  laughed  about  them  afterwards.  We  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">young, thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore’s trust, of course …</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  had  admitted  me  to  Hogwarts  when  no  other  headmaster  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for</p>
<p class="calibre1">my own and others’ safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a>into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty</p>
<p class="calibre1">feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month’s adventure. And I</p>
<p class="calibre1">haven’t changed …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin’s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. “All</p>
<p class="calibre1">this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn’t do it. Why? Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  too  cowardly.  It  would  have  meant  admitting  that  I’d  betrayed  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">trust while I was at school, admitting that I’d led others along with me …</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Dumbledore’s  trust  has  meant  everything  to  me.  He  let  me  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my</p>
<p class="calibre1">adult  life,  unable  to  find  paid  work  because  of  what  I  am.  And  so  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it</p>
<p class="calibre1">… so, in a way, Snape’s been right about me all along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape?”  said  Black  harshly,  taking  his  eyes  off  Scabbers  for  the  first</p>
<p class="calibre1">time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. “What’s Snape got to do with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin heavily. “He’s teaching here as well.” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my</p>
<p class="calibre1">appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons … you</p>
<p class="calibre1">see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which</p>
<p class="calibre1">involved me —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black made a derisive noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  served  him  right,”  he  sneered.  “Sneaking  around,  trying  to  find  out</p>
<p class="calibre1">what we were up to … hoping he could get us expelled. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Severus was very interested in where I went every month.” Lupin told</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “We were in the same year, you know, and we</p>
<p class="calibre1">—  er  —  didn’t  like  each  other  very  much.  He  especially  disliked  James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jealous, I think, of James’s talent on the Quidditch field … anyway Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she</p>
<p class="calibre1">led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be — er — amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree  trunk  with  a  long  stick,  and  he’d  be  able  to  get  in  after  me.  Well,  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course, Snape tried it — if he’d got as far as this house, he’d have met a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fully  grown  werewolf  —  but  your  father,  who’d  heard  what  Sirius  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">done,  went  after  Snape  and  pulled  him  back,  at  great  risk  to  his  life  …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s why Snape doesn’t like you,” said Harry slowly, “because he</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought you were in on the joke?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">directly at Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a><img src="index-261_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Servant of Lord Voldemort</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  screamed.  Black  leapt  to  his  feet.  Harry  felt  as  though  he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">received a huge electric shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,” said Snape, throwing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin’s chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very useful, Potter, I thank you. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape  was  slightly  breathless,  but  his  face  was  full  of  suppressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">triumph. “You’re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?” he said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his eyes glittering. “I’ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  potion  tonight,  so  I  took  a  gobletful  along.  And  very  lucky  I  did  …</p>
<p class="calibre1">lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at</p>
<p class="calibre1">it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway</p>
<p class="calibre1">and out of sight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Severus —” Lupin began, but Snape overrode him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve  told  the  headmaster  again  and  again  that  you’re  helping  your  old</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend  Black  into  the  castle,  Lupin,  and  here’s  the  proof.  Not  even  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Severus,  you’re  making  a  mistake,”  said  Lupin  urgently.  “You  haven’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard everything — I can explain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two  more  for  Azkaban  tonight,”  said  Snape,  his  eyes  now  gleaming</p>
<p class="calibre1">fanatically. “I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this. … He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>was  quite  convinced  you  were  harmless,  you  know,  Lupin  …  a   <i class="calibre3">tame</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">werewolf —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  fool,”  said  Lupin  softly.  “Is  a  schoolboy  grudge  worth  putting  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">innocent man back inside Azkaban?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">BANG!  Thin,  snakelike  cords  burst  from  the  end  of  Snape’s  wand  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">twisted  themselves  around  Lupin’s  mouth,  wrists,  and  ankles;  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">overbalanced  and  fell  to  the  floor,  unable  to  move.  With  a  roar  of  rage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  started  toward  Snape,  but  Snape  pointed  his  wand  straight  between</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give  me  a  reason,”  he  whispered.  “Give  me  a  reason  to  do  it,  and  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">swear I will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  stopped  dead.  It  would  have  been  impossible  to  say  which  face</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed more hatred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  stood  there,  paralyzed,  not  knowing  what  to  do  or  whom  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe.  He  glanced  around  at  Ron  and  Hermione.  Ron  looked  just  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">confused  as  he  did,  still  fighting  to  keep  hold  on  the  struggling  Scabbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathless  voice,  “Professor  Snape  —  it  —  it  wouldn’t  hurt  to  hear  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ve got to say, w — would it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss  Granger,  you  are  already  facing  suspension  from  this  school,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape spat. “You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  convicted  murderer  and  a  werewolf.  For  once  in  your  life,  <i class="calibre3">hold  your</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">tongue. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if — if there was a mistake —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted, looking suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite  deranged.  “DON’T  TALK  ABOUT  WHAT  YOU  DON’T</p>
<p class="calibre1">UNDERSTAND!” A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still pointed at Black’s face. Hermione fell silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Vengeance  is  very  sweet,”  Snape  breathed  at  Black.  “How  I  hoped  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be the one to catch you. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The joke’s on you again, Severus,” Black snarled. “As long as this boy</p>
<p class="calibre1">brings his rat up to the castle” — he jerked his head at Ron — “I’ll come</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up to the castle?” said Snape silkily. “I don’t think we need to go that</p>
<p class="calibre1">far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ll be very pleased to see you, Black … pleased enough to give you a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little kiss, I daresay. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>What little color there was in Black’s face left it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You — you’ve got to hear me out,” he croaked. “The rat — look at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rat —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  there  was  a  mad  glint  in  Snape’s  eyes  that  Harry  had  never  seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">before. He seemed beyond reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, all of you,” he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. “I’ll drag the werewolf. Perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dementors will have a kiss for him too —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three</p>
<p class="calibre1">strides and blocked the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get  out  of  the  way,  Potter,  you’re  in  enough  trouble  already,”  snarled</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape. “If I hadn’t been here to save your skin —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  said.  “I’ve  been  alone  with  him  loads  of  times,  having  defense</p>
<p class="calibre1">lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn’t he just</p>
<p class="calibre1">finish me off then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  ask  me  to  fathom  the  way  a  werewolf’s  mind  works,”  hissed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape. “Get out of the way, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“YOU’RE PATHETIC!” Harry yelled. “JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE</p>
<p class="calibre1">A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON’T EVEN LISTEN —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“SILENCE!  I  WILL  NOT  BE  SPOKEN  TO  LIKE  THAT!”  Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrieked,  looking  madder  than  ever.  “Like  father,  like  son,  Potter!  I  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">just  saved  your  neck;  you  should  be  thanking  me  on  bended  knee!  You</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have been well served if he’d killed you! You’d have died like your</p>
<p class="calibre1">father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black — now get</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the way, or I will  <i class="calibre3">make you. </i> GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even</p>
<p class="calibre1">one step toward him, he had raised his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expelliarmus</i>!”  he  yelled  —  except  that  his  wasn’t  the  only  voice  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouted.  There  was  a  blast  that  made  the  door  rattle  on  its  hinges;  Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked</p>
<p class="calibre1">out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">at exactly the same moment. Snape’s wand soared in a high arc and landed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the bed next to Crookshanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p264"></a>“You  shouldn’t  have  done  that,”  said  Black,  looking  at  Harry.  “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">should have left him to me. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry avoided Black’s eyes. He wasn’t sure, even now, that he’d done the</p>
<p class="calibre1">right thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We  attacked  a  teacher.  …  We  attacked  a  teacher  …  ,”  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">whimpered,  staring  at  the  lifeless  Snape  with  frightened  eyes.  “Oh,  we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to be in so much trouble —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  was  struggling  against  his  bonds.  Black  bent  down  quickly  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">untied  him.  Lupin  straightened  up,  rubbing  his  arms  where  the  ropes  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut into them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Harry,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m still not saying I believe you,” he told Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then  it’s  time  we  offered  you  some  proof,”  said  Lupin.  “You,  boy  —</p>
<p class="calibre1">give me Peter, please. Now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come  off  it,”  he  said  weakly.  “Are  you  trying  to  say  he  broke  out  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Azkaban  just  to  get  his  hands  on   <i class="calibre3">Scabbers</i>?  I  mean  …”  He  looked  up  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione for support, “Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat</p>
<p class="calibre1">— there are millions of rats — how’s he supposed to know which one he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">after if he was locked up in Azkaban?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  know,  Sirius,  that’s  a  fair  question,”  said  Lupin,  turning  to  Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">and frowning slightly. “How  <i class="calibre3">did</i> you find out where he was?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  put  one  of  his  clawlike  hands  inside  his  robes  and  took  out  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  photograph  of  Ron  and  his  family  that  had  appeared  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Daily  Prophet</i>  the  previous  summer,  and  there,  on  Ron’s  shoulder,  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you get this?” Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fudge,”  said  Black.  “When  he  came  to  inspect  Azkaban  last  year,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page … on this boy’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder.  …  I  knew  him  at  once  …  how  many  times  had  I  seen  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts</p>
<p class="calibre1">… to where Harry was. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My God,” said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper and back again. “His front paw …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about it?” said Ron defiantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a>“He’s got a toe missing,” said Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” Lupin breathed. “So simple … so  <i class="calibre3">brilliant</i> … he cut it off</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just  before  he  transformed,”  said  Black.  “When  I  cornered  him,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">yelled for the whole street to hear that I’d betrayed Lily and James. Then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his</p>
<p class="calibre1">back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself — and sped down into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sewer with the other rats. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t you ever hear, Ron?” said Lupin. “The biggest bit of Peter they</p>
<p class="calibre1">found was his finger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">been in my family for ages, right —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Twelve years, in fact,” said Lupin. “Didn’t you ever wonder why he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">living so long?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We — we’ve been taking good care of him!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not  looking  too  good  at  the  moment,  though,  is  he?”  said  Lupin.  “I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">guess he’s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  been  scared  of  that  mad  cat!”  said  Ron,  nodding  toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  that  wasn’t  right,  Harry  thought  suddenly.  …  Scabbers  had  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking  ill  before  he  met  Crookshanks  …  ever  since  Ron’s  return  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Egypt … since the time when Black had escaped. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This  cat  isn’t  mad,”  said  Black  hoarsely.  He  reached  out  a  bony  hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  stroked  Crookshanks’s  fluffy  head.  “He’s  the  most  intelligent  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind I’ve ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. … Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">been helping me. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” breathed Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn’t … so he stole the passwords</p>
<p class="calibre1">into Gryffindor Tower for me. … As I understand it, he took them from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy’s bedside table. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  brain  seemed  to  be  sagging  under  the  weight  of  what  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearing. It was absurd … and yet …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  Peter  got  wind  of  what  was  going  on  and  ran  for  it.  …”  croaked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black. “This cat — Crookshanks, did you call him? — told me Peter had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>left blood on the sheets. … I supposed he bit himself. … Well, faking his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own death had worked once. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">These words jolted Harry to his senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And why did he fake his death?” he said furiously. “Because he knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">you were about to kill him like you killed my parents!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Lupin, “Harry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And now you’ve come to finish him off!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I have,” said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then I should’ve let Snape take you!” Harry shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,”  said  Lupin  hurriedly,  “don’t  you  see?  All  this  time  we’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down — but it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the other way around, don’t you see?  <i class="calibre3">Peter</i> betrayed your mother and</p>
<p class="calibre1">father — Sirius tracked  <i class="calibre3">Peter</i> down —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“THAT’S  NOT  TRUE!”  Harry  yelled.  “HE  WAS  THEIR  SECRET-</p>
<p class="calibre1">KEEPER!  HE  SAID  SO  BEFORE  YOU  TURNED  UP.  HE  SAID  HE</p>
<p class="calibre1">KILLED THEM!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">were suddenly overbright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry … I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I persuaded Lily and</p>
<p class="calibre1">James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Secret-Keeper instead of me. … I’m to blame, I know it. … The night they</p>
<p class="calibre1">died, I’d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived at his hiding place, he’d gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t  feel  right.  I  was  scared.  I  set  out  for  your  parents’  house  straight</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies … I realized</p>
<p class="calibre1">what Peter must’ve done … what I’d done. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice broke. He turned away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enough  of  this,”  said  Lupin,  and  there  was  a  steely  note  in  his  voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  had  never  heard  before.  “There’s  one  certain  way  to  prove  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">really happened. Ron,  <i class="calibre3">give me that rat. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  are  you  going  to  do  with  him  if  I  give  him  to  you?”  Ron  asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin tensely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Force him to show himself,” said Lupin. “If he really is a rat, it won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurt him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron  hesitated.  Then  at  long  last,  he  held  out  Scabbers  and  Lupin  took</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny black eyes bulging in his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>“Ready, Sirius?” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black had already retrieved Snape’s wand from the bed. He approached</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  and  the  struggling  rat,  and  his  wet  eyes  suddenly  seemed  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">burning in his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Together?” he said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  think  so,”  said  Lupin,  holding  Scabbers  tightly  in  one  hand  and  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand in the other. “On the count of three. One — two — THREE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  flash  of  blue-white  light  erupted  from  both  wands;  for  a  moment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly — Ron</p>
<p class="calibre1">yelled — the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding flash of</p>
<p class="calibre1">light and then —</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  like  watching  a  speeded-up  film  of  a  growing  tree.  A  head  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man  was  standing  where  Scabbers  had  been,  cringing  and  wringing  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands.  Crookshanks  was  spitting  and  snarling  on  the  bed;  the  hair  on  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">back was standing up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  a  very  short  man,  hardly  taller  than  Harry  and  Hermione.  His</p>
<p class="calibre1">thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  short  time.  His  skin  looked  grubby,  almost  like  Scabbers’s  fur,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">something  of  the  rat  lingered  around  his  pointed  nose  and  his  very  small, </p>
<p class="calibre1">watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  hello,  Peter,”  said  Lupin  pleasantly,  as  though  rats  frequently</p>
<p class="calibre1">erupted into old school friends around him. “Long time, no see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“S  —  Sirius  …  R  —  Remus  …”  Even  Pettigrew’s  voice  was  squeaky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, his eyes darted toward the door. “My friends … my old friends …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him</p>
<p class="calibre1">a warning look, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve  been  having  a  little  chat,  Peter,  about  what  happened  the  night</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily  and  James  died.  You  might  have  missed  the  finer  points  while  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">were squeaking around down there on the bed —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remus,” gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">out over his pasty face, “you don’t believe him, do you… ? He tried to kill</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, Remus. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So we’ve heard,” said Lupin, more coldly. “I’d like to clear up one or</p>
<p class="calibre1">two little matters with you, Peter, if you’d be so —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>“He’s  come  to  try  and  kill  me  again!”  Pettigrew  squeaked  suddenly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his</p>
<p class="calibre1">index was missing. “He killed Lily and James and now he’s going to kill me</p>
<p class="calibre1">too. … You’ve got to help me, Remus. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s  face  looked  more  skull-like  than  ever  as  he  stared  at  Pettigrew</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his fathomless eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a few things out,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once</p>
<p class="calibre1">more,  eyes  taking  in  the  boarded  windows  and,  again,  the  only  door.  “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew he’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for me! I’ve been waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for this for twelve years!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?” said Lupin, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">brow furrowed. “When nobody has ever done it before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  got  dark  powers  the  rest  of  us  can  only  dream  of!”  Pettigrew</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouted shrilly. “How else did he get out of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  started  to  laugh,  a  horrible,  mirthless  laugh  that  filled  the  whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort, teach me tricks?” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What,  scared  to  hear  your  old  master’s  name?”  said  Black.  “I  don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">blame you, Peter. His lot aren’t very happy with you, are they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  know  what  you  mean,  Sirius  —”  muttered  Pettigrew,  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You haven’t been hiding from  <i class="calibre3">me</i> for twelve years,” said Black. “You’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  hiding  from  Voldemort’s  old  supporters.  I  heard  things  in  Azkaban, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter. … They all think you’re dead, or you’d have to answer to them. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they</p>
<p class="calibre1">think  the  double-crosser  double-crossed  them.  Voldemort  went  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Potters’ on your information … and Voldemort met his downfall there. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  all  Voldemort’s  supporters  ended  up  in  Azkaban,  did  they?  There  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they’ve seen the error of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their ways. … If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t  know  …  what  you’re  talking  about…  ,”  said  Pettigrew  again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  shrilly  than  ever.  He  wiped  his  face  on  his  sleeve  and  looked  up  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin. “You don’t believe this — this madness, Remus —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a>“I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent</p>
<p class="calibre1">man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,” said Lupin evenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Innocent,  but  scared!”  squealed  Pettigrew.  “If  Voldemort’s  supporters</p>
<p class="calibre1">were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spy, Sirius Black!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s face contorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How dare you,” he growled, sounding suddenly like the bear-sized dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">he had been. “I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people</p>
<p class="calibre1">who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter — I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">never  understand  why  I  didn’t  see  you  were  the  spy  from  the  start.  You</p>
<p class="calibre1">always liked big friends who’d look after you, didn’t you? It used to be us</p>
<p class="calibre1">… me and Remus … and James. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me, a spy … must be out of your mind … never … don’t know how you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can say such a —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lily  and  James  only  made  you  Secret-Keeper  because  I  suggested  it,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  hissed,  so  venomously  that  Pettigrew  took  a  step  backward.  “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought it was the perfect plan … a bluff. … Voldemort would be sure to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come after me, would never dream they’d use a weak, talentless thing like</p>
<p class="calibre1">you. … It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling</p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew  was  muttering  distractedly;  Harry  caught  words  like  “far-</p>
<p class="calibre1">fetched”  and  “lunacy,”  but  he  couldn’t  help  paying  more  attention  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ashen  color  of  Pettigrew’s  face  and  the  way  his  eyes  continued  to  dart</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward the windows and door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor  Lupin?”  said  Hermione  timidly.  “Can  —  can  I  say</p>
<p class="calibre1">something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly, Hermione,” said Lupin courteously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well — Scabbers — I mean, this — this man — he’s been sleeping in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s dormitory for three years. If he’s working for You-Know-Who, how</p>
<p class="calibre1">come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!”  said  Pettigrew  shrilly,  pointing  at  Ron  with  his  maimed  hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank  you!  You  see,  Remus?  I  have  never  hurt  a  hair  of  Harry’s  head! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why should I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll  tell  you  why,”  said  Black.  “Because  you  never  did  anything  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone  unless  you  could  see  what  was  in  it  for  you.  Voldemort’s  been  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">hiding  for  fifteen  years,  they  say  he’s  half  dead.  You  weren’t  about  to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>commit  murder  right  under  Albus  Dumbledore’s  nose,  for  a  wreck  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wizard who’d lost all of his power, were you? You’d want to be quite sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  was  the  biggest  bully  in  the  playground  before  you  went  back  to  him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t  you?  Why  else  did  you  find  a  wizard  family  to  take  you  in? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keeping  an  ear  out  for  news,  weren’t  you,  Peter?  Just  in  case  your  old</p>
<p class="calibre1">protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew  opened  his  mouth  and  closed  it  several  times.  He  seemed  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have lost the ability to talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — Mr. Black — Sirius?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  jumped  at  being  addressed  like  this  and  stared  at  Hermione  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though he had never seen anything quite like her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get out of Azkaban, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if you didn’t use Dark Magic?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank  you!”  gasped  Pettigrew,  nodding  frantically  at  her.  “Exactly! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Precisely what I —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Lupin  silenced  him  with  a  look.  Black  was  frowning  slightly  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione,  but  not  as  though  he  were  annoyed  with  her.  He  seemed  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">pondering his answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  don’t  know  how  I  did  it,”  he  said  slowly.  “I  think  the  only  reason  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">never  lost  my  mind  is  that  I  knew  I  was  innocent.  That  wasn’t  a  happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought, so the dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  knowing  who  I  am  …  helped  me  keep  my  powers  …  so  when  it  all</p>
<p class="calibre1">became  …  too  much  …  I  could  transform  in  my  cell  …  become  a  dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dementors  can’t  see,  you  know.  …”  He  swallowed.  “They  feel  their  way</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward  people  by  feeding  off  their  emotions.  …  They  could  tell  that  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">feelings  were  less  —  less  human,  less  complex  when  I  was  a  dog  …  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  thought,  of  course,  that  I  was  losing  my  mind  like  everyone  else  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">there, so it didn’t trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had no</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope of driving them away from me without a wand. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  then  I  saw  Peter  in  that  picture  …  I  realized  he  was  at  Hogwarts</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Harry … perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Dark Side was gathering strength again. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">while at Black as though hypnotized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…  ready  to  strike  at  the  moment  he  could  be  sure  of  allies  …  and  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliver the last Potter to them. If he gave them Harry, who’d dare say he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">betrayed Lord Voldemort? He’d be welcomed back with honors. …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>“So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter</p>
<p class="calibre1">was still alive. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  remembered  what  Mr.  Weasley  had  told  Mrs.  Weasley.  “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">guards say he’s been talking in his sleep … always the same words … ‘ <i class="calibre3">He’s</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">at Hogwarts. </i>’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  was  as  if  someone  had  lit  a  fire  in  my  head,  and  the  dementors</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t destroy it. … It wasn’t a happy feeling … it was an obsession …</p>
<p class="calibre1">but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog. … It’s so much harder</p>
<p class="calibre1">for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused. … I was thin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">very thin … thin enough to slip through the bars. … I swam as a dog back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  mainland.  …  I  journeyed  north  and  slipped  into  the  Hogwarts</p>
<p class="calibre1">grounds as a dog. I’ve been living in the forest ever since, except when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">came to watch the Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at Harry, who did not look away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Believe  me,”  croaked  Black.  “Believe  me,  Harry.  I  never  betrayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  at  long  last,  Harry  believed  him.  Throat  too  tight  to  speak,  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry’s nod had been his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">death  sentence.  He  shuffled  forward  on  his  knees,  groveling,  his  hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">clasped in front of him as though praying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius — it’s me … it’s Peter … your friend … you wouldn’t …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  enough  filth  on  my  robes  without  you  touching  them,”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remus!”  Pettigrew  squeaked,  turning  to  Lupin  instead,  writhing</p>
<p class="calibre1">imploringly in front of him. “You don’t believe this … wouldn’t Sirius have</p>
<p class="calibre1">told you they’d changed the plan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,” said Lupin. “I assume that’s why</p>
<p class="calibre1">you didn’t tell me, Sirius?” he said casually over Pettigrew’s head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forgive me, Remus,” said Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,” said Lupin, who was now rolling up his</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleeves. “And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing  <i class="calibre3">you</i> were the spy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a>“Of course,” said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. “Shall we kill him together?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I think so,” said Lupin grimly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  wouldn’t  …  you  won’t…  ,”  gasped  Pettigrew.  And  he  scrambled</p>
<p class="calibre1">around to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron … haven’t I been a good friend … a good pet? You won’t let them</p>
<p class="calibre1">kill me, Ron, will you … you’re on my side, aren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I let you sleep in my  <i class="calibre3">bed</i>!” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kind boy … kind master …” Pettigrew crawled toward Ron, “you won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">let them do it. … I was your rat. … I was a good pet. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If  you  made  a  better  rat  than  a  human,  it’s  not  much  to  boast  about, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter,”  said  Black  harshly.  Ron,  going  still  paler  with  pain,  wrenched  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken  leg  out  of  Pettigrew’s  reach.  Pettigrew  turned  on  his  knees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione’s robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sweet girl … clever girl … you — you won’t let them. … Help me. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew’s clutching hands and backed</p>
<p class="calibre1">away against the wall, looking horrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew  knelt,  trembling  uncontrollably,  and  turned  his  head  slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry … Harry … you look just like your father … just like him. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?” roared Black. “HOW DARE</p>
<p class="calibre1">YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT</p>
<p class="calibre1">OF HIM?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  James  wouldn’t  have  wanted  me  killed.  …  James  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood, Harry … he would have shown me mercy. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew’s shoulders, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">threw  him  backward  onto  the  floor.  He  sat  there,  twitching  with  terror, </p>
<p class="calibre1">staring up at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,” said Black, who was shaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">too. “Do you deny it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew  burst  into  tears.  It  was  horrible  to  watch,  like  an  oversized, </p>
<p class="calibre1">balding baby, cowering on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord … you have no</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea … he has weapons you can’t imagine. … I was scared, Sirius, I was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“DON’T  LIE!”  bellowed  Black.  “YOU’D  BEEN  PASSING</p>
<p class="calibre1">INFORMATION  TO  HIM  FOR  A  YEAR  BEFORE  LILY  AND  JAMES</p>
<p class="calibre1">DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He — he was taking over everywhere!” gasped Pettigrew. “Wh — what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was there to be gained by refusing him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever existed?” said Black, with a terribly fury in his face. “Only innocent</p>
<p class="calibre1">lives, Peter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  don’t  understand!”  whined  Pettigrew.  “He  would  have  killed  me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!” roared Black. “DIED RATHER</p>
<p class="calibre1">THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">YOU!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You should have realized,” said Lupin quietly, “if Voldemort didn’t kill</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO!”  Harry  yelled.  He  ran  forward,  placing  himself  in  front  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew, facing the wands. “You can’t kill him,” he said breathlessly. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black and Lupin both looked staggered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  this  piece  of  vermin  is  the  reason  you  have  no  parents,”  Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">snarled.  “This  cringing  bit  of  filth  would  have  seen  you  die  too,  without</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning  a  hair.  You  heard  him.  His  own  stinking  skin  meant  more  to  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">than your whole family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” Harry panted. “We’ll take him up to the castle. We’ll hand him</p>
<p class="calibre1">over to the dementors. … He can go to Azkaban … but don’t kill him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry’s knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You — thank you — it’s more than I deserve — thank you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get off me,” Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew’s hands off him in disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not doing this for you. I’m doing it because — I don’t reckon my dad</p>
<p class="calibre1">would’ve wanted them to become killers — just for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  one  moved  or  made  a  sound  except  Pettigrew,  whose  breath  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">at each other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>“You’re the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,” said Black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But think … think what he did. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He can go to Azkaban,” Harry repeated. “If anyone deserves that place, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he does. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well,” said Lupin. “Stand aside, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to tie him up,” said Lupin. “That’s all, I swear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  stepped  out  of  the  way.  Thin  cords  shot  from  Lupin’s  wand  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,  and  next  moment,  Pettigrew  was  wriggling  on  the  floor,  bound  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gagged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if you transform, Peter,” growled Black, his own wand pointing at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew too, “we  <i class="calibre3">will</i> kill you. You agree, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew could see him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,”  said  Lupin,  suddenly  businesslike.  “Ron,  I  can’t  mend  bones</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your</p>
<p class="calibre1">leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg with his wand, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">muttered, “<i class="calibre3">Ferula. </i>”  Bandages  spun  up  Ron’s  leg,  strapping  it  tightly  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg</p>
<p class="calibre1">and didn’t wince. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s better,” he said. “Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about Professor Snape?” said Hermione in a small voice, looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">down at Snape’s prone figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  nothing  seriously  wrong  with  him,”  said  Lupin,  bending  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape  and  checking  his  pulse.  “You  were  just  a  little  —  overenthusiastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still  out  cold.  Er  —  perhaps  it  will  be  best  if  we  don’t  revive  him  until</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re safely back in the castle. We can take him like this. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  muttered,  “<i class="calibre3">Mobilicorpus. </i>”  As  though  invisible  strings  were  tied  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s  wrists,  neck,  and  knees,  he  was  pulled  into  a  standing  position, </p>
<p class="calibre1">head  still  lolling  unpleasantly,  like  a  grotesque  puppet.  He  hung  a  few</p>
<p class="calibre1">inches  above  the  ground,  his  limp  feet  dangling.  Lupin  picked  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And two of us should be chained to this,” said Black, nudging Pettigrew</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his toe. “Just to make sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll do it,” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a>“And me,” said Ron savagely, limping forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, left arm chained to Lupin’s right, right arm to Ron’s left. Ron’s face</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  set.  He  seemed  to  have  taken  Scabbers’s  true  identity  as  a  personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">insult.  Crookshanks  leapt  lightly  off  the  bed  and  led  the  way  out  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a><img src="index-276_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Dementor’s Kiss</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way</p>
<p class="calibre1">down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up by his own wand, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  being  pointed  at  him  by  Sirius.  Harry  and  Hermione  brought  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  turn  sideways  to  manage  it;  Lupin  still  had  Pettigrew  covered  with  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand.  Harry  could  see  them  edging  awkwardly  along  the  tunnel  in  single</p>
<p class="calibre1">file.  Crookshanks  was  still  in  the  lead.  Harry  went  right  after  Black,  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  still  making  Snape  drift  along  ahead  of  them;  he  kept  bumping  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression Black was making</p>
<p class="calibre1">no effort to prevent this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what this means?” Black said abruptly to Harry as they made</p>
<p class="calibre1">their slow progress along the tunnel. “Turning Pettigrew in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re free,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes … ,” said Black. “But I’m also — I don’t know if anyone ever told</p>
<p class="calibre1">you — I’m your godfather.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a>“Well  …  your  parents  appointed  me  your  guardian,”  said  Black  stiffly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If anything happened to them …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Black. “But … well … think about it. Once my name’s cleared … if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you wanted a … a different home …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry’s stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">of rock protruding from the ceiling. “Leave the Dursleys?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of  course,  I  thought  you  wouldn’t  want  to,”  said  Black  quickly.  “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand, I just thought I’d —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you insane?” said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Black’s. “Of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course  I  want  to  leave  the  Dursleys!  Have  you  got  a  house?  When  can  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">move in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black turned right around to look at him; Snape’s head was scraping the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceiling but Black didn’t seem to care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You want to?” he said. “You mean it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black’s gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years younger</p>
<p class="calibre1">were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was recognizable</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the man who had laughed at Harry’s parents’ wedding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  did  not  speak  again  until  they  had  reached  the  end  of  the  tunnel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered upward without</p>
<p class="calibre1">any sound of savaging branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black  saw  Snape  up  through  the  hole,  then  stood  back  for  Harry  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  grounds  were  very  dark  now;  the  only  light  came  from  the  distant</p>
<p class="calibre1">windows  of  the  castle.  Without  a  word,  they  set  off.  Pettigrew  was  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry’s mind was buzzing. He was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going  to  leave  the  Dursleys.  He  was  going  to  live  with  Sirius  Black,  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents’ best friend. … He felt dazed. … What would happen when he told</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Dursleys  he  was  going  to  live  with  the  convict  they’d  seen  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">television… ! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One wrong move, Peter,” said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still pointed sideways at Pettigrew’s chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a>Silently  they  tramped  through  the  grounds,  the  castle  lights  growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly  larger.  Snape  was  still  drifting  weirdly  ahead  of  Black,  his  chin</p>
<p class="calibre1">bumping on his chest. And then —</p>
<p class="calibre1">A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">party was bathed in moonlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape  collided  with  Lupin,  Pettigrew,  and  Ron,  who  had  stopped</p>
<p class="calibre1">abruptly. Black froze. He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  could  see  Lupin’s  silhouette.  He  had  gone  rigid.  Then  his  limbs</p>
<p class="calibre1">began to shake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, my —” Hermione gasped. “He didn’t take his potion tonight! He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not safe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Run,” Black whispered. “Run. Now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Harry  couldn’t  run.  Ron  was  chained  to  Pettigrew  and  Lupin.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">leapt forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leave it to me — RUN!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  terrible  snarling  noise.  Lupin’s  head  was  lengthening.  So</p>
<p class="calibre1">was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  face  and  hands,  which  were  curling  into  clawed  paws.  Crookshanks’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair was on end again; he was backing away —</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  side.  He  had  transformed.  The  enormous,  bearlike  dog  bounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dog  seized  it  about  the  neck  and  pulled  it  backward,  away  from  Ron  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to notice</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything else. It was Hermione’s scream that alerted him —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew  had  dived  for  Lupin’s  dropped  wand.  Ron,  unsteady  on  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandaged  leg,  fell.  There  was  a  bang,  a  burst  of  light  —  and  Ron  lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">motionless on the ground. Another bang — Crookshanks flew into the air</p>
<p class="calibre1">and back to the earth in a heap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expelliarmus</i>!”  Harry  yelled,  pointing  his  own  wand  at  Pettigrew; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and out of sight. “Stay where you are!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shouted, running forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the manacle on Ron’s outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a>There  was  a  howl  and  a  rumbling  growl;  Harry  turned  to  see  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius, he’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” Harry yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  words  he  scrambled  up  again,  and  in  an  instant,  the  sound  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What  did  he  do  to  him?”  Hermione  whispered.  Ron’s  eyes  were  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">him breathing, but he didn’t seem to recognize them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone … they had</p>
<p class="calibre1">no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d  better  get  them  up  to  the  castle  and  tell  someone,”  said  Harry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. Come —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">whining: a dog in pain. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius,” Harry muttered, staring into the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing they could do for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Harry,  running  flat  out,  felt  the  cold  without  realizing  what  it  must</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean —</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  yelping  stopped  abruptly.  As  they  reached  the  lakeshore,  they  saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">why — Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands over his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Nooo, </i>” he moaned. “<i class="calibre3">Noooo</i> …  <i class="calibre3">please.…</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, </p>
<p class="calibre1">icy  cold  penetrating  his  insides,  fog  starting  to  obscure  his  vision;  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  appearing  out  of  the  darkness  on  every  side;  they  were  encircling</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, think of something happy!” Harry yelled, raising his wand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">faint screaming that had started inside it —</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’m going to live with my godfather. I’m leaving the Dursleys. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a>He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground, pale</p>
<p class="calibre1">as death. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He’ll be all right. I’m going to go and live with him. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>! Hermione, help me!  <i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expecto</i> —” Hermione whispered, “<i class="calibre3">expecto</i> —  <i class="calibre3">expecto</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  she  couldn’t  do  it.  The  dementors  were  closing  in,  barely  ten  feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting closer. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">EXPECTO  PATRONUM</i>!”  Harry  yelled,  trying  to  blot  the  screaming</p>
<p class="calibre1">from his ears. “<i class="calibre3">EXPECTO PATRONUM</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  moment,  Harry  felt  Hermione  collapse  next  to  him.  He  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone … completely alone. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expecto</i> —  <i class="calibre3">expecto patronum</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes. With a</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge effort, he fought to remember — Sirius was innocent — innocent —</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">We’ll</i>  <i class="calibre3">be okay</i> —  <i class="calibre3">I’m going to live with him</i> —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Expecto patronum</i>!” he gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a dementor halt, very</p>
<p class="calibre1">close  to  him.  It  couldn’t  walk  through  the  cloud  of  silver  mist  Harry  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">conjured.  A  dead,  slimy  hand  slid  out  from  under  the  cloak.  It  made  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No  —   <i class="calibre3">no</i>  —”  Harry  gasped.  “He’s  innocent  …   <i class="calibre3">expecto</i>  —   <i class="calibre3">expecto</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">patronum</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could feel them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">wind  around  him.  The  nearest  dementor  seemed  to  be  considering  him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then it raised both its rotting hands — and lowered its hood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where  there  should  have  been  eyes,  there  was  only  thin,  gray  scabbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">skin,  stretched  blankly  over  empty  sockets.  But  there  was  a  mouth  …  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn’t move or speak. His</p>
<p class="calibre1">Patronus flickered and died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">White fog was blinding him. He had to fight …  <i class="calibre3">expecto patronum</i> … he</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t  see  …  and  in  the  distance,  he  heard  the  familiar  screaming  …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a> <i class="calibre3">expecto patronum</i> … he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm …</p>
<p class="calibre1">they weren’t going to take him. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  neck.  They  were  forcing  his  face  upward.  …  He  could  feel  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath. … It was going to get rid of him first. … He could feel its putrid</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath. … His mother was screaming in his ears. … She was going to be the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last thing he ever heard —</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a</p>
<p class="calibre1">silvery light growing brighter and brighter. … He felt himself fall forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto  the  grass.  …  Facedown,  too  weak  to  move,  sick  and  shaking,  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened his eyes. The dementor must have released him. The blinding light</p>
<p class="calibre1">was illuminating the grass around him. … The screaming had stopped, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold was ebbing away. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something  was  driving  the  dementors  back.  …  It  was  circling  around</p>
<p class="calibre1">him and Black and Hermione. … They were leaving. … The air was warm</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">With  every  ounce  of  strength  he  could  muster,  Harry  raised  his  head  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few  inches  and  saw  an  animal  amid  the  light,  galloping  away  across  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lake. … Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it was. … It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was as bright as a unicorn. … Fighting to stay conscious, Harry watched it</p>
<p class="calibre1">canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For a moment, Harry saw, </p>
<p class="calibre1">by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back … raising his hand to pat it</p>
<p class="calibre1">… someone who looked strangely familiar … but it couldn’t be …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t understand. He couldn’t think anymore. He felt the last of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a><img src="index-282_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Hermione’s Secret</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Shocking business … shocking … miracle none of them died … never</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard the like … by thunder, it was lucky you were there, Snape. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Minister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Order of Merlin, Second Class, I’d say. First Class, if I can wangle it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much indeed, Minister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nasty cut you’ve got there. … Black’s work, I suppose?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">No</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was innocent. They weren’t responsible for their actions. On the other hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">their interference might have permitted Black to escape. … They obviously</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought  they  were  going  to  catch  Black  single-handed.  They’ve  got  away</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  great  deal  before  now.  …  I’m  afraid  it’s  given  them  a  rather  high</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion of themselves … and of course Potter has always been allowed an</p>
<p class="calibre1">extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, well, Snape … Harry Potter, you know … we’ve all got a bit of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blind spot where he’s concerned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  yet  —  is  it  good  for  him  to  be  given  so  much  special  treatment? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other student</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a>would be suspended — at the very least — for leading his friends into such</p>
<p class="calibre1">danger.  Consider,  Minister  —  against  all  school  rules  —  after  all  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">precautions  put  in  place  for  his  protection  —  out-of-bounds,  at  night, </p>
<p class="calibre1">consorting with a werewolf and a murderer — and I have reason to believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  well  …  we  shall  see,  Snape,  we  shall  see.  …  The  boy  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">undoubtedly been foolish. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  lay  listening  with  his  eyes  tight  shut.  He  felt  very  groggy.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his brain, so that it was difficult to understand. … His limbs felt like lead; </p>
<p class="calibre1">his eyelids too heavy to lift. … He wanted to lie here, on this comfortable</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed, forever. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors … you’ve really</p>
<p class="calibre1">no idea what made them retreat, Snape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Minister … by the time I had come ’round they were heading back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to their positions at the entrances. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black, </p>
<p class="calibre1">naturally,  conjured  stretchers,  and  brought  them  all  straight  back  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a pause. Harry’s brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">He opened his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he could</p>
<p class="calibre1">make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">squinted. Ron’s red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey’s arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  moved  his  head  over  on  the  pillow.  In  the  bed  to  his  right  lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  looked  petrified,  and  when  she  saw  that  Harry  was  awake,  pressed  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">finger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices  of  Cornelius  Fudge  and  Snape  were  coming  through  it  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corridor outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed.  He  turned  to  look  at  her.  She  was  carrying  the  largest  block  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>“Ah,  you’re  awake!”  she  said  briskly.  She  placed  the  chocolate  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s Ron?” said Harry and Hermione together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll live,” said Madam Pomfrey grimly. “As for you two … you’ll be</p>
<p class="calibre1">staying here until I’m satisfied you’re — Potter, what do you think you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  sitting  up,  putting  his  glasses  back  on,  and  picking  up  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need to see the headmaster,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter,”  said  Madam  Pomfrey  soothingly,  “it’s  all  right.  They’ve  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">Black.  He’s  locked  away  upstairs.  The  dementors  will  be  performing  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kiss any moment now —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WHAT?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  heard  in  the  corridor  outside;  next  second,  Cornelius  Fudge  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape had entered the ward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, Harry, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking agitated. “You should be</p>
<p class="calibre1">in bed — has he had any chocolate?” he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minister,  listen!”  Harry  said.  “Sirius  Black’s  innocent!  Peter  Pettigrew</p>
<p class="calibre1">faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can’t let the dementors do</p>
<p class="calibre1">that thing to Sirius, he’s —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  Harry,  you’re  very  confused,  you’ve  been  through  a  dreadful</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordeal, lie back down, now, we’ve got everything under control. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“YOU  HAVEN’T!”  Harry  yelled.  “YOU’VE  GOT  THE  WRONG</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAN!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minister, listen, please,” Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry’s side</p>
<p class="calibre1">and was gazing imploringly into Fudge’s face. “I saw him too. It was Ron’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">rat, he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see, Minister?” said Snape. “Confunded, both of them. … Black’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">done a very good job on them. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED!” Harry roared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minister!  Professor!”  said  Madam  Pomfrey  angrily.  “I  must  insist  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not distressed, I’m trying to tell them what happened!” Harry said</p>
<p class="calibre1">furiously. “If they’d just listen —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a>But  Madam  Pomfrey  suddenly  stuffed  a  large  chunk  of  chocolate  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him back</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto the bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,  <i class="calibre3">please, </i> Minister, these children need care. Please leave —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  door  opened  again.  It  was  Dumbledore.  Harry  swallowed  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For  heaven’s  sake!”  said  Madam  Pomfrey  hysterically.  “Is  this  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  apologies,  Poppy,  but  I  need  a  word  with  Mr.  Potter  and  Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Granger,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I have just been talking to Sirius Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  suppose  he’s  told  you  the  same  fairy  tale  he’s  planted  in  Potter’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind?” spat Snape. “Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,  indeed,  is  Black’s  story,”  said  Dumbledore,  surveying  Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">closely through his half-moon spectacles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  does  my  evidence  count  for  nothing?”  snarled  Snape.  “Peter</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the grounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  was  because  you  were  knocked  out,  Professor!”  said  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">earnestly. “You didn’t arrive in time to hear —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, Snape,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is disturbed in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind, we must make allowances —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” said Dumbledore</p>
<p class="calibre1">abruptly. “Cornelius, Severus, Poppy — please leave us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Headmaster!”  sputtered  Madam  Pomfrey  “They  need  treatment,  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">need rest —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This cannot wait,” said Dumbledore. “I must insist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam  Pomfrey  pursed  her  lips  and  strode  away  into  her  office  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the large</p>
<p class="calibre1">gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The dementors should have arrived by now,” he said. “I’ll go and meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. Dumbledore, I’ll see you upstairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  crossed  to  the  door  and  held  it  open  for  Snape,  but  Snape  hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>“You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?” Snape whispered, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes fixed on Dumbledore’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” Dumbledore repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape took a step toward Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathed.  “You  haven’t  forgotten  that,  Headmaster?  You  haven’t  forgotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he once tried to kill  <i class="calibre3">me</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My  memory  is  as  good  as  it  ever  was,  Severus,”  said  Dumbledore</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding.  It  closed  behind  them,  and  Dumbledore  turned  to  Harry  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione. They both burst into speech at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we  <i class="calibre3">saw</i> Pettigrew —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— he’s a rat —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn’t Sirius —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  is  your  turn  to  listen,  and  I  beg  you  will  not  interrupt  me,  because</p>
<p class="calibre1">there is very little time,” he said quietly. “There is not a shred of proof to</p>
<p class="calibre1">support  Black’s  story,  except  your  word  —  and  the  word  of  two  thirteen-</p>
<p class="calibre1">year-old  wizards  will  not  convince  anybody.  A  street  full  of  eyewitnesses</p>
<p class="calibre1">swore  they  saw  Sirius  murder  Pettigrew.  I  myself  gave  evidence  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters’ Secret-Keeper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Lupin can tell you —” Harry said, unable to stop himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor  Lupin  is  currently  deep  in  the  forest,  unable  to  tell  anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be</p>
<p class="calibre1">worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our kind that his support will count for very little — and the fact that he and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius are old friends —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Listen to me, Harry. </i> It is too late, you understand me? You must see that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Snape’s version of events is far more convincing than yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  hates  Sirius,”  Hermione  said  desperately.  “All  because  of  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">stupid trick Sirius played on him —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady —</p>
<p class="calibre1">entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife — without Pettigrew, alive or dead, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a>we have no chance of overturning Sirius’s sentence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">But you believe us. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  I  do,”  said  Dumbledore  quietly.  “But  I  have  no  power  to  make</p>
<p class="calibre1">other men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">him  were  falling  sharply  away.  He  had  grown  used  to  the  idea  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore  could  solve  anything.  He  had  expected  Dumbledore  to  pull</p>
<p class="calibre1">some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Harry to Hermione, “is more  <i class="calibre3">time. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But —” Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. “OH!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,  pay  attention,”  said  Dumbledore,  speaking  very  low,  and  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">clearly. “Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes well, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But remember this, </p>
<p class="calibre1">both of you:  <i class="calibre3">you must not be seen. </i> Miss Granger, you know the law — you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know what is at stake. …  <i class="calibre3">You</i> —  <i class="calibre3">must</i> —  <i class="calibre3">not</i> —  <i class="calibre3">be</i> —  <i class="calibre3">seen. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his heel and looked back as he reached the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am going to lock you in. It is —” he consulted his watch, “five minutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good luck?”  Harry repeated  as  the  door  closed behind Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three turns? What’s he talking about? What are we supposed to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Hermione  was  fumbling  with  the  neck  of  her  robes,  pulling  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, come here,” she said urgently. “<i class="calibre3">Quick</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  moved  toward  her,  completely  bewildered.  She  was  holding  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chain out. He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had thrown the chain around his neck too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?” she said breathlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are we doing?” Harry said, completely lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione turned the hourglass over three times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying very</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast, backward. A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears were</p>
<p class="calibre1">pounding, he tried to yell but couldn’t hear his own voice —</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a>And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into</p>
<p class="calibre1">focus again —</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  standing  next  to  Hermione  in  the  deserted  entrance  hall  and  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open</p>
<p class="calibre1">front  doors.  He  looked  wildly  around  at  Hermione,  the  chain  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hourglass cutting into his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, what — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In here!” Hermione seized Harry’s arm and dragged him across the hall</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among the</p>
<p class="calibre1">buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What — how — Hermione, what happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve  gone  back  in  time,”  Hermione  whispered,  lifting  the  chain  off</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s neck in the darkness. “Three hours back …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  found  his  own  leg  and  gave  it  a  very  hard  pinch.  It  hurt  a  lot, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh! Listen! Someone’s coming! I think — I think it might be us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Footsteps across the hall … yes, I think it’s us going down to Hagrid’s!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you telling me,” Harry whispered, “that we’re here in this cupboard</p>
<p class="calibre1">and we’re out there too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. “I’m sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s us. It doesn’t sound like more than three people … and we’re walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly because we’re under the Invisibility Cloak —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She broke off, still listening intently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve gone down the front steps. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but Harry wanted a few questions answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where did you  <i class="calibre3">get</i> that hourglass thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  called  a  Time-Turner,”  Hermione  whispered,  “and  I  got  it  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I’ve been using it all year to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn’t tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model student, and that I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">never,  ever  use  it  for  anything  except  my  studies.  …  I’ve  been  turning  it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a>back  so  I  could  do  hours  over  again,  that’s  how  I’ve  been  doing  several</p>
<p class="calibre1">lessons at once, see? But …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  <i class="calibre3">I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. </i> Why did he</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell us to go back three hours? How’s that going to help Sirius?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at her shadowy face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There  must  be  something  that  happened  around  now  he  wants  us  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">change,”  he  said  slowly.  “What  happened?  We  were  walking  down  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s three hours ago. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This   <i class="calibre3">is</i>  three  hours  ago,  and  we   <i class="calibre3">are</i>  walking  down  to  Hagrid’s,”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione. “We just heard ourselves leaving. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in</p>
<p class="calibre1">concentration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore just said — just said we could save more than one innocent</p>
<p class="calibre1">life. …” And then it hit him. “Hermione, we’re going to save Buckbeak!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But — how will that help Sirius?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore said — he just told us where the window is — the window</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Flitwick’s office! Where they’ve got Sirius locked up! We’ve got to fly</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak  up  to  the  window  and  rescue  Sirius!  Sirius  can  escape  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak — they can escape together!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From what Harry could see of Hermione’s face, she looked terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If we manage that without being seen, it’ll be a miracle!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  we’ve  got  to  try,  haven’t  we?”  said  Harry.  He  stood  up  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressed his ear against the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn’t sound like anyone’s there. … Come on, let’s go. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  pushed  open  the  closet  door.  The  entrance  hall  was  deserted.  As</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and down the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of the trees in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If anyone’s looking out of the window —” Hermione squeaked, looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">up at the castle behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll run for it,” said Harry determinedly. “Straight into the forest, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">right? We’ll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,  but  we’ll  go  around  by  the  greenhouses!”  said  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathlessly. “We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid’s front door, or we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid’s by now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still  working  out  what  she  meant,  Harry  set  off  at  a  sprint,  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind  him.  They  tore  across  the  vegetable  gardens  to  the  greenhouses, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a>paused  for  a  moment  behind  them,  then  set  off  again,  fast  as  they  could, </p>
<p class="calibre1">skirting  around  the  Whomping  Willow,  tearing  toward  the  shelter  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forest. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Safe  in  the  shadows  of  the  trees,  Harry  turned  around;  seconds  later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione arrived beside him, panting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” she gasped. “We need to sneak over to Hagrid’s. … Keep out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight, Harry. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid’s house, they heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and</p>
<p class="calibre1">peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  white,  looking  around  to  see  who  had  knocked.  And  Harry  heard  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s us. We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it</p>
<p class="calibre1">off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is the weirdest thing we’ve ever done,” Harry said fervently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s move along a bit,” Hermione whispered. “We need to get nearer to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  crept  through  the  trees  until  they  saw  the  nervous  hippogriff, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tethered to the fence around Hagrid’s pumpkin patch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now?” Harry whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Hermione. “If we steal him now, those Committee people will</p>
<p class="calibre1">think  Hagrid  set  him  free!  We’ve  got  to  wait  until  they’ve  seen  he’s  tied</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s  going  to  give  us  about  sixty  seconds,”  said  Harry.  This  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting to seem impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s Hagrid breaking the milk jug,” Hermione whispered. “I’m going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to find Scabbers in a moment —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure  enough,  a  few  minutes  later,  they  heard  Hermione’s  shriek  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” said Harry suddenly, “what if we — we just run in there and</p>
<p class="calibre1">grab Pettigrew —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a>“No!”  said  Hermione  in  a  terrified  whisper.  “Don’t  you  understand? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re  breaking  one  of  the  most  important  wizarding  laws!  Nobody’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed  to  change  time,  nobody!  You  heard  Dumbledore,  if  we’re  seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  what  do  you  think  you’d  do  if  you  saw  yourself  bursting  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s house?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d — I’d think I’d gone mad,” said Harry, “or I’d think there was some</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark Magic going on —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Exactly</i>!  You  wouldn’t  understand,  you  might  even  attack  yourself! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t  you  see?  Professor  McGonagall  told  me  what  awful  things  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened when wizards have meddled with time. … Loads of them ended</p>
<p class="calibre1">up killing their past or future selves by mistake!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay!” said Harry. “It was just an idea, I just thought —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  head  a  few  inches  to  get  a  clear  view  of  the  distant  front  doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore,  Fudge,  the  old  Committee  member,  and  Macnair  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">executioner were coming down the steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re about to come out!” Hermione breathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid’s back door opened, and Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw  himself,  Ron,  and  Hermione  walking  out  of  it  with  Hagrid.  It  was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind the tree, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and watching himself in the pumpkin patch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  okay,  Beaky,  it’s  okay  …  ,”  Hagrid  said  to  Buckbeak.  Then  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Go on. Get goin’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid, we can’t —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll tell them what really happened —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They can’t kill him —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go! It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’ all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cloak over him and Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go quick. Don’ listen. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  knock  on  Hagrid’s  front  door.  The  execution  party  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived. Hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin, leaving the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back  door  ajar.  Harry  watched  the  grass  flatten  in  patches  all  around  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a>gone  …  but  the  Harry  and  Hermione  hidden  in  the  trees  could  now  hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">what was happening inside the cabin through the back door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is the beast?” came the cold voice of Macnair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face appeared at Hagrid’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We — er — have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll  make  it  quick.  And  then  you  and  Macnair  need  to  sign  it.  Macnair, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re supposed to listen too, that’s procedure —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now or never. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Fudge’s  voice  started  again,  Harry  darted  out  from  behind  his  tree, </p>
<p class="calibre1">vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">It  is  the  decision  of  the  Committee  for  the  Disposal  of  Dangerous</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Creatures  that  the  hippogriff  Buckbeak,  hereafter  called  the  condemned, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">shall be executed on the sixth of June at sundown</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce orange eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…   <i class="calibre3">sentenced</i>   <i class="calibre3">to  execution  by  beheading,  to  be  carried  out  by  the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Committee</i>’ <i class="calibre3">s appointed executioner, Walden Macnair</i> …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on, we’re going to help</p>
<p class="calibre1">you. Quietly … quietly …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…  <i class="calibre3">as</i>  <i class="calibre3">witnessed below. </i> Hagrid, you sign here. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  threw  all  his  weight  onto  the  rope,  but  Buckbeak  had  dug  in  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">front feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  let’s  get  this  over  with,”  said  the  reedy  voice  of  the  Committee</p>
<p class="calibre1">member from inside Hagrid’s cabin. “Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay inside —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I — I wan’ ter be with him. … I don’ wan’ him ter be alone —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Footsteps echoed from within the cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Buckbeak, move</i>!” Harry hissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s neck. The hippogriff</p>
<p class="calibre1">began  to  walk,  rustling  its  wings  irritably.  They  were  still  ten  feet  away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid’s back door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>“One  moment,  please,  Macnair,”  came  Dumbledore’s  voice.  “You  need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  sign  too.”  The  footsteps  stopped.  Harry  heaved  on  the  rope.  Buckbeak</p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped his beak and walked a little faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s white face was sticking out from behind a tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, hurry!” she mouthed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could still hear Dumbledore’s voice talking from within the cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  gave  the  rope  another  wrench.  Buckbeak  broke  into  a  grudging  trot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had reached the trees. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quick!  Quick!”  Hermione  moaned,  darting  out  from  behind  her  tree, </p>
<p class="calibre1">seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  looked  over  his  shoulder;  they  were  now  blocked  from  sight;  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear us —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s  back  door  had  opened  with  a  bang.  Harry,  Hermione,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak  stood  quite  still;  even  the  hippogriff  seemed  to  be  listening</p>
<p class="calibre1">intently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence … then —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member. “Where is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the beast?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I saw it! Just here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  swishing  noise,  and  the  thud  of  an  axe.  The  executioner</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed  to  have  swung  it  into  the  fence  in  anger.  And  then  came  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid’s words through his sobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he’s  <i class="calibre3">gone</i>! Musta pulled himself free! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beaky, yeh clever boy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor to stop him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone untied him!” the executioner was snarling. “We should search</p>
<p class="calibre1">the grounds, the forest —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Macnair,  if  Buckbeak  has  indeed  been  stolen,  do  you  really  think  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thief  will  have  led  him  away  on  foot?”  said  Dumbledore,  still  sounding</p>
<p class="calibre1">amused. “Search the skies, if you will. … Hagrid, I could do with a cup of</p>
<p class="calibre1">tea. Or a large brandy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a>“O’  —  o’  course,  Professor,”  said  Hagrid,  who  sounded  weak  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">happiness. “Come in, come in. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  and  Hermione  listened  closely.  They  heard  footsteps,  the  soft</p>
<p class="calibre1">cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now what?” whispered Harry, looking around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll  have  to  hide  in  here,”  said  Hermione,  who  looked  very  shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to wait until they’ve gone back to the castle. Then we wait until</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s  safe  to  fly  Buckbeak  up  to  Sirius’s  window.  He  won’t  be  there  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">another couple of hours. … Oh, this is going to be difficult. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun was setting now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re going to have to move,” said Harry, thinking hard. “We’ve got to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won’t know what’s going on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak’s rope. “But</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  moved  around  the  edge  of  the  forest,  darkness  falling  thickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which</p>
<p class="calibre1">they could make out the Willow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s Ron!” said Harry suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the still night air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come  <i class="calibre3">here</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Gotcha</i>! Get off, you stinking cat —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s Sirius!” said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  roots  of  the  Willow.  They  saw  him  bowl  Harry  over,  then  seize</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said Harry, watching the dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulling Ron into the roots. “Ouch — look, I just got walloped by the tree —</p>
<p class="calibre1">and so did you — this is  <i class="calibre3">weird</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Whomping  Willow  was  creaking  and  lashing  out  with  its  lower</p>
<p class="calibre1">branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">the trunk. And then the tree froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And there we go … ,” Harry muttered. “We’re in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p295"></a>The  moment  they  disappeared,  the  tree  began  to  move  again.  Seconds</p>
<p class="calibre1">later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right after we’d gone down into the passage!” said Hermione. “If  <i class="calibre3">only</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore had come with us …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said Harry bitterly. “I bet you</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything Fudge would’ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  watched  the  four  men  climb  the  castle  steps  and  disappear  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here  comes  Lupin!”  said  Harry  as  they  saw  another  figure  sprinting</p>
<p class="calibre1">down the stone steps and haring toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the</p>
<p class="calibre1">knot  on  the  trunk.  The  tree  stopped  fighting,  and  Lupin,  too,  disappeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the gap in its roots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If he’d only grabbed the cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lying there. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned to Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d never be able to get it</p>
<p class="calibre1">and —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  <i class="calibre3">we mustn’t be seen</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How  can  you  stand  this?”  he  asked  Hermione  fiercely.  “Just  standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">here and watching it happen?” He hesitated. “I’m going to grab the cloak!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  <i class="calibre3">no</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione seized the back of Harry’s robes not a moment too soon. Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he walked. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">large bottle was swinging from his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">See</i>?”  Hermione  whispered.  “<i class="calibre3">See  what  would  have  happened</i>?  We’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got to keep out of sight!  <i class="calibre3">No, Buckbeak</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid</p>
<p class="calibre1">meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get away. His head drooped sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">came charging out of them, running toward the Willow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s  fists  clenched  as  they  watched  Snape  skid  to  a  halt  next  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p296"></a>“Get your filthy hands off it,” Harry snarled under his breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the</p>
<p class="calibre1">knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s it,” said Hermione quietly. “We’re all down there … and now</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve just got to wait until we come back up again. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  took  the  end  of  Buckbeak’s  rope  and  tied  it  securely  around  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,  there’s  something  I  don’t  understand.  …  Why  didn’t  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">out … there were so many of them. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  sat  down  too.  He  explained  what  he’d  seen;  how,  as  the  nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementor  had  lowered  its  mouth  to  Harry’s,  a  large  silver  something  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what was it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Harry. “A real Patronus. A powerful one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But who conjured it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t say anything. He was thinking back to the person he’d seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been … but</p>
<p class="calibre1">how  <i class="calibre3">could</i> it have been? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t you see what they looked like?” said Hermione eagerly. “Was it</p>
<p class="calibre1">one of the teachers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. “He wasn’t a teacher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  it  must  have  been  a  really  powerful  wizard,  to  drive  all  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors away. … If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn’t it light</p>
<p class="calibre1">him up? Couldn’t you see — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I saw him,” said Harry slowly. “But … maybe I imagined it. … I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t thinking straight. … I passed out right afterward. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Who did you think it was</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  think  —”  Harry  swallowed,  knowing  how  strange  this  was  going  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound. “I think it was my dad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  glanced  up  at  Hermione  and  saw  that  her  mouth  was  fully  open</p>
<p class="calibre1">now. She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, your dad’s — well —  <i class="calibre3">dead, </i>” she said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know that,” said Harry quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a>“You think you saw his ghost?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know … no … he looked solid. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe I was seeing things,” said Harry. “But … from what I could see</p>
<p class="calibre1">… it looked like him. … I’ve got photos of him. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  know  it  sounds  crazy,”  said  Harry  flatly.  He  turned  to  look  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching</p>
<p class="calibre1">for worms. But he wasn’t really watching Buckbeak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  thinking  about  his  father  and  about  his  father’s  three  oldest</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends … Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. … Had all four of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  out  on  the  grounds  tonight?  Wormtail  had  reappeared  this  evening</p>
<p class="calibre1">when everyone had thought he was dead. … Was it so impossible his father</p>
<p class="calibre1">had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the lake? The figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  too  far  away  to  see  distinctly  …  yet  he  had  felt  sure,  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment, before he’d lost consciousness. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  leaves  overhead  rustled  faintly  in  the  breeze.  The  moon  drifted  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  out  of  sight  behind  the  shifting  clouds.  Hermione  sat  with  her  face</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned toward the Willow, waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, at last, after over an hour …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here we come!” Hermione whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  and  Harry  got  to  their  feet.  Buckbeak  raised  his  head.  They  saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin,  Pettigrew,  and  Ron  clambering  awkwardly  out  of  the  hole  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">roots … followed by the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next</p>
<p class="calibre1">came  Harry,  Hermione,  and  Black.  They  all  began  to  walk  toward  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,”  Hermione  muttered  as  though  she  knew  exactly  what  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking, “we’ve got to stay put. We mustn’t be seen. There’s nothing we</p>
<p class="calibre1">can do. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So  we’re  just  going  to  let  Pettigrew  escape  all  over  again.  …”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How  do  you  expect  to  find  a  rat  in  the  dark?”  snapped  Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s  nothing  we  can  do!  We  came  back  to  help  Sirius;  we’re  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed to be doing anything else!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">All right</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a>The  moon  slid  out  from  behind  its  cloud.  They  saw  the  tiny  figures</p>
<p class="calibre1">across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There goes Lupin,” Hermione whispered. “He’s transforming —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione!” said Harry suddenly. “We’ve got to move!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We mustn’t, I keep telling you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not to interfere! Lupin’s going to run into the forest, right at us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quick!” she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. “Quick! Where are we</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors will be coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">any moment —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back to Hagrid’s!” Harry said. “It’s empty now — come on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They could hear the werewolf howling behind them. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  and  Buckbeak  flashed  past  him;  Harry  threw  himself  in  after</p>
<p class="calibre1">them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh,  Fang,  it’s  us!”  said  Hermione,  hurrying  over  and  scratching  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears to quieten him. “That was really close!” she said to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  looking  out  of  the  window.  It  was  much  harder  to  see  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside  Hagrid’s  house.  He  lay  down  in  front  of  the  fire,  folded  his  wings</p>
<p class="calibre1">contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  think  I’d  better  go  outside  again,  you  know,”  said  Harry  slowly.  “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t see what’s going on — we won’t know when it’s time —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not going to try and interfere,” said Harry quickly. “But if we don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">see  what’s  going  on,  how’re  we  going  to  know  when  it’s  time  to  rescue</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well  …  okay,  then  …  I’ll  wait  here  with  Buckbeak  …  but  Harry,  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">careful — there’s a werewolf out there — and the dementors —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">… He and Hermione would be running to him any moment. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest.  …  Whoever  had  sent  that  Patronus  would  be  appearing  at  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment. …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a>For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid’s door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You must not be seen. </i> But he didn’t want to be seen. He wanted to do the</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing. … He had to know. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  every  direction,  gliding  around  the  edges  of  the  lake.  …  They  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">moving  away  from  where  Harry  stood,  to  the  opposite  bank.  …  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t have to get near them. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father. … If</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was him … if it really was him … he had to know, had to find out. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  lake  was  coming  nearer  and  nearer,  but  there  was  no  sign  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">anybody. On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver — his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own attempts at a Patronus —</p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  bush  at  the  very  edge  of  the  water.  Harry  threw  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified excitement shot</p>
<p class="calibre1">through him — any moment now —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on!” he muttered, staring about. “Where are you? Dad, come on</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors</p>
<p class="calibre1">across  the  lake.  One  of  them  was  lowering  its  hood.  It  was  time  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time —</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen his father — he had</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen  <i class="calibre3">himself</i> —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">EXPECTO PATRONUM</i>!” he yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  was.  It  looked  like  a  horse.  It  was  galloping  silently  away  from  him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the swarming dementors. … Now it was galloping around and around the</p>
<p class="calibre1">black  shapes  on  the  ground,  and  the  dementors  were  falling  back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">scattering, retreating into the darkness. … They were gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still</p>
<p class="calibre1">surface of the water. It wasn’t a horse. It wasn’t a unicorn, either. It was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above … it was coming back to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. …</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a>It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Harry realized …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Prongs</i>,” he whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart, he heard hooves behind him — he whirled around and saw Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What did you do</i>?” she said fiercely. “You said you were only going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep a lookout!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I just saved all our lives … ,” said Harry. “Get behind here — behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">this bush — I’ll explain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  listened  to  what  had  just  happened  with  her  mouth  open  yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did anyone see you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, haven’t you been listening?  <i class="calibre3">I</i> saw me but I thought I was my dad! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s okay!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I can’t believe it. … You conjured up a Patronus that drove away</p>
<p class="calibre1">all those dementors! That’s very,  <i class="calibre3">very</i> advanced magic. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because I’d already done it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">… Does that make sense?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know — Harry, look at Snape!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together  they  peered  around  the  bush  at  the  other  bank.  Snape  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">regained  consciousness.  He  was  conjuring  stretchers  and  lifting  the  limp</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms  of  Harry,  Hermione,  and  Black  onto  them.  A  fourth  stretcher,  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front of him, he moved them away toward the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,  it’s  nearly  time,”  said  Hermione  tensely,  looking  at  her  watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hospital wing. We’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before</p>
<p class="calibre1">anybody realizes we’re missing. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for worms again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’  you  reckon  he’s  up  there  yet?”  said  Harry,  checking  his  watch.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">West Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>“Look!” Hermione whispered. “Who’s that? Someone’s coming back out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the castle!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  stared  through  the  darkness.  The  man  was  hurrying  across  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Macnair!”  said  Harry.  “The  executioner!  He’s  gone  to  get  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dementors! This is it, Hermione —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  put  her  hands  on  Buckbeak’s  back  and  Harry  gave  her  a  leg</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over his neck</p>
<p class="calibre1">and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better hold on to me —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  knees,  feeling  the  great  wings  rising  powerfully  beneath  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hear her</p>
<p class="calibre1">muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this — oh, I  <i class="calibre3">really</i> don’t like this —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  urged  Buckbeak  forward.  They  were  gliding  quietly  toward  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">upper floors of the castle. … Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows flashing</p>
<p class="calibre1">past —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you</p>
<p class="calibre1">counted  the  fact  that  they  kept  rising  up  and  down  several  feet  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  there!”  Harry  said,  spotting  Sirius  as  they  rose  up  beside  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window.  He  reached  out,  and  as  Buckbeak’s  wings  fell,  was  able  to  tap</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharply on the glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair, hurried</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still</p>
<p class="calibre1">gripping the back of Harry’s robes with her left hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Alohomora</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The window sprang open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get on — there’s not much time,” said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly</p>
<p class="calibre1">on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. “You’ve got to get out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">here — the dementors are coming — Macnair’s gone to get them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  had  managed  to  fling  one  leg  over  Buckbeak’s  back  and  pull  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto the hippogriff behind Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope. “Up to the tower —</p>
<p class="calibre1">come on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring</p>
<p class="calibre1">upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll reach Flitwick’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">office any moment, they’ll find out you’re gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What happened to the other boy? Ron?” croaked Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  going  to  be  okay.  He’s  still  out  of  it,  but  Madam  Pomfrey  says</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’ll be able to make him better. Quick — go —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Black was still staring down at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can I ever thank —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll see each other again,” he said. “You are — truly your father’s son, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  squeezed  Buckbeak’s  sides  with  his  heels.  Harry  and  Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more. … The hippogriff took</p>
<p class="calibre1">off  into  the  air.  …  He  and  his  rider  became  smaller  and  smaller  as  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">gazed  after  them  …  then  a  cloud  drifted  across  the  moon.  …  They  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a><img src="index-303_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Owl Post Again</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  was  tugging  at  his  sleeve,  staring  at  her  watch.  “We’ve  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing us — before Dumbledore locks the door —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, “let’s go. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  slipped  through  the  doorway  behind  them  and  down  a  tightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiraling  stone  staircase.  As  they  reached  the  bottom  of  it,  they  heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the corridor at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">foot of the staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“… only hope Dumbledore’s not going to make difficulties,” Snape was</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying. “The Kiss will be performed immediately?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair</p>
<p class="calibre1">has  been  highly  embarrassing.  I  can’t  tell  you  how  much  I’m  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward  to  informing  the   <i class="calibre3">Daily  Prophet</i>  that  we’ve  got  him  at  last.  …  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">daresay  they’ll  want  to  interview  you,  Snape  …  and  once  young  Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">back in his right mind, I expect he’ll want to tell the  <i class="calibre3">Prophet</i> exactly how</p>
<p class="calibre1">you saved him. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape’s smirk as he and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge  passed  Harry  and  Hermione’s  hiding  place.  Their  footsteps  died</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a>away.  Harry  and  Hermione  waited  a  few  moments  to  make  sure  they’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">really  gone,  then  started  to  run  in  the  opposite  direction.  Down  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">staircase, then another, along a new corridor — then they heard a cackling</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Peeves</i>!” Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione’s wrist. “In here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  tore  into  a  deserted  classroom  to  their  left  just  in  time.  Peeves</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed  to  be  bouncing  along  the  corridor  in  boisterous  good  spirits, </p>
<p class="calibre1">laughing his head off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, he’s horrible,” whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. “I bet he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">all  excited  because  the  dementors  are  going  to  finish  off  Sirius.  …”  She</p>
<p class="calibre1">checked her watch. “Three minutes, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  waited  until  Peeves’s  gloating  voice  had  faded  into  the  distance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione  —  what’ll  happen  —  if  we  don’t  get  back  inside  —  before</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore locks the door?” Harry panted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want to think about it!” Hermione moaned, checking her watch</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. “One minute!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay  —  I  can  hear  Dumbledore,”  said  Hermione  tensely.  “Come  on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  crept  along  the  corridor.  The  door  opened.  Dumbledore’s  back</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying. “It is five minutes to</p>
<p class="calibre1">midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore  backed  out  of  the  room,  closed  the  door,  and  took  out  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand  to  magically  lock  it.  Panicking,  Harry  and  Hermione  ran  forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore  looked  up,  and  a  wide  smile  appeared  under  the  long  silver</p>
<p class="calibre1">mustache. “Well?” he said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We did it!” said Harry breathlessly. “Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore beamed at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well  done.  I  think  —”  He  listened  intently  for  any  sound  within  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hospital wing. “Yes, I think you’ve gone too — get inside — I’ll lock you in</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  and  Hermione  slipped  back  inside  the  dormitory.  It  was  empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the lock</p>
<p class="calibre1">clicked  behind  them,  Harry  and  Hermione  crept  back  to  their  own  beds, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did  I  hear  the  headmaster  leaving?  Am  I  allowed  to  look  after  my</p>
<p class="calibre1">patients now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  in  a  very  bad  mood.  Harry  and  Hermione  thought  it  best  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">accept  their  chocolate  quietly.  Madam  Pomfrey  stood  over  them,  making</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure  they  ate  it.  But  Harry  could  hardly  swallow.  He  and  Hermione  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting,  listening,  their  nerves  jangling.  …  And  then,  as  they  both  took  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fury echoing from somewhere above them. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was that?” said Madam Pomfrey in alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  they  could  hear  angry  voices,  growing  louder  and  louder.  Madam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pomfrey was staring at the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really  —  they’ll  wake  everybody  up!  What  do  they  think  they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  was  trying  to  hear  what  the  voices  were  saying.  They  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing nearer —</p>
<p class="calibre1">“He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the room with him. When this gets out —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HE DIDN’T DISAPPARATE!” Snape roared, now very close at hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“YOU CAN’T APPARATE  <i class="calibre3">OR</i> DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! </p>
<p class="calibre1">THIS — HAS — SOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked up —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">BAM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door of the hospital wing burst open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone  looked  calm.  Indeed,  he  looked  as  though  he  was  quite  enjoying</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID YOU DO?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey. “Control yourself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This door’s been locked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we just saw —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape howled, pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  Harry  and  Hermione.  His  face  was  twisted;  spit  was  flying  from  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking nonsense!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>“YOU  DON’T  KNOW  POTTER!”  shrieked  Snape.  “HE  DID  IT,  I</p>
<p class="calibre1">KNOW HE DID IT —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Think about what you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of  course  not!”  said  Madam  Pomfrey,  bristling.  “I  would  have  heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there you have it, Severus,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Unless you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly</p>
<p class="calibre1">shocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the ward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fellow  seems  quite  unbalanced,”  said  Fudge,  staring  after  him.  “I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said Dumbledore quietly. “He’s just suffered</p>
<p class="calibre1">a severe disappointment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  not  the  only  one!”  puffed  Fudge.  “The   <i class="calibre3">Daily  Prophet’s</i>  going  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff’s escape to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,  and  I’ll  be  a  laughingstock!  Well  …  I’d  better  go  and  notify  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ministry. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the dementors?” said Dumbledore. “They’ll be removed from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">school, I trust?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, they’ll have to go,” said Fudge, running his fingers distractedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">through his hair. “Never dreamed they’d attempt to administer the Kiss on</p>
<p class="calibre1">an innocent boy. … Completely out of control … no, I’ll have them packed</p>
<p class="calibre1">off back to Azkaban tonight. … Perhaps we should think about dragons at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the school entrance. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid  would  like  that,”  said  Dumbledore,  smiling  at  Harry  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headed back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to her office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. They could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p307"></a>“What  —  what  happened?”  he  groaned.  “Harry?  Why  are  we  in  here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where’s Sirius? Where’s Lupin? What’s going on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione looked at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You explain,” said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,  it  was  to  find  an  almost  deserted  castle.  The  sweltering  heat  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogsmeade  visit.  Neither  Ron  nor  Hermione  felt  like  going,  however,  so</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  and  Harry  wandered  onto  the  grounds,  still  talking  about  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving</p>
<p class="calibre1">its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread of the conversation</p>
<p class="calibre1">as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him</p>
<p class="calibre1">from there just last night. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very bleary-eyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid,  mopping  his  sweaty  face  with  one  of  his  tablecloth-sized</p>
<p class="calibre1">handkerchiefs and beaming down at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Know I shouldn’ feel happy, after wha’ happened las’ night,” he said. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean, Black escapin’ again, an’ everythin’ — but guess what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” they said, pretending to look curious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beaky! He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all night!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s wonderful!” said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because</p>
<p class="calibre1">he looked as though he was close to laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah … can’t’ve tied him up properly,” said Hagrid, gazing happily out</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the grounds. “I was worried this mornin’, mind … thought he mighta</p>
<p class="calibre1">met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin’</p>
<p class="calibre1">las’ night. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey,  haven’  yeh  heard?”  said  Hagrid,  his  smile  fading  a  little.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowered  his  voice,  even  though  there  was  nobody  in  sight.  “Er  —  Snape</p>
<p class="calibre1">told all the Slytherins this mornin’. … Thought everyone’d know by now</p>
<p class="calibre1">… Professor Lupin’s a werewolf, see. An’ he was loose on the grounds las’</p>
<p class="calibre1">night. … He’s packin’ now, o’ course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s  <i class="calibre3">packing</i>?” said Harry, alarmed. “Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leavin’, isn’ he?” said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Resigned firs’ thing this mornin’. Says he can’t risk it happenin’ again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p308"></a>Harry scrambled to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to see him,” he said to Ron and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if he’s resigned —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— doesn’t sound like there’s anything we can do —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t care. I still want to see him. I’ll meet you back here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin’s office door was open. He had already packed most of his things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The grindylow’s empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his desk</p>
<p class="calibre1">and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I saw you coming,” said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been poring over. It was the Marauder’s Map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  just  saw  Hagrid,”  said  Harry.  “And  he  said  you’d  resigned.  It’s  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">true, is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m  afraid  it  is,”  said  Lupin.  He  started  opening  his  desk  drawers  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking out the contents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Why</i>?” said Harry. “The Ministry of Magic don’t think you were helping</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius, do they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to save your lives.” He sighed. “That was the final straw for Severus. I think</p>
<p class="calibre1">the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he — er —  <i class="calibre3">accidentally</i> let</p>
<p class="calibre1">slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not leaving just because of that!” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin smiled wryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents. … They</p>
<p class="calibre1">will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I see their point. I could have bitten any of you. … That must never happen</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever had!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Harry. “Don’t go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin  shook  his  head  and  didn’t  speak.  He  carried  on  emptying  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">him stay, Lupin said, “From what the headmaster told me this morning, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If I’m proud of anything I’ve done this</p>
<p class="calibre1">year, it’s how much you’ve learned. … Tell me about your Patronus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How d’you know about that?” said Harry, distracted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p309"></a>“What else could have driven the dementors back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  told  Lupin  what  had  happened.  When  he’d  finished,  Lupin  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,” he said. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">guessed right … that’s why we called him Prongs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned to look at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here  —  I  brought  this  from  the  Shrieking  Shack  last  night,”  he  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. “And …” He hesitated, then held</p>
<p class="calibre1">out the Marauder’s Map too. “I am no longer your teacher, so I don’t feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">guilty about giving you back this as well. It’s no use to me, and I daresay</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took the map and grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would’ve wanted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">lure me out of school … you said they’d have thought it was funny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And  so  we  would  have,”  said  Lupin,  now  reaching  down  to  close  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">case.  “I  have  no  hesitation  in  saying  that  James  would  have  been  highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder’s Map</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  Professor  Dumbledore.  He  didn’t  look  surprised  to  see  Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Headmaster.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has been a real pleasure</p>
<p class="calibre1">teaching you. I feel sure we’ll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is</p>
<p class="calibre1">no need to see me to the gates, I can manage. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  had  the  impression  that  Lupin  wanted  to  leave  as  quickly  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good-bye,  then,  Remus,”  said  Dumbledore  soberly.  Lupin  shifted  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grindylow  tank  slightly  so  that  he  and  Dumbledore  could  shake  hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p310"></a>“Why so miserable, Harry?” he said quietly. “You should be very proud</p>
<p class="calibre1">of yourself after last night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It  didn’t  make  any  difference,”  said  Harry  bitterly.  “Pettigrew  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t make any difference?” said Dumbledore quietly. “It made all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an</p>
<p class="calibre1">innocent man from a terrible fate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Terrible. </i> Something stirred in Harry’s memory.  <i class="calibre3">Greater and more terrible</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">than ever before</i>  <i class="calibre3">…</i> Professor Trelawney’s prediction! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was having my Divination</p>
<p class="calibre1">exam, Professor Trelawney went very — very strange.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed?” said Dumbledore. “Er — stranger than usual, you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes … her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said … she</p>
<p class="calibre1">said  Voldemort’s  servant  was  going  to  set  out  to  return  to  him  before</p>
<p class="calibre1">midnight.  …  She  said  the  servant  would  help  him  come  back  to  power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  stared  up  at  Dumbledore.  “And  then  she  sort  of  became  normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, and she couldn’t remember anything she’d said. Was it — was she</p>
<p class="calibre1">making a real prediction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore looked mildly impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,” he said thoughtfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I should offer her a pay raise. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But —” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this</p>
<p class="calibre1">so calmly? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  —  I  stopped  Sirius  and  Professor  Lupin  from  killing  Pettigrew! </p>
<p class="calibre1">That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your experience with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  always  so  complicated,  so  diverse,  that  predicting  the  future  is  a  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult business indeed. … Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof</p>
<p class="calibre1">of that. … You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is</p>
<p class="calibre1">in your debt. … When one wizard saves another wizard’s life, it creates a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain bond between them … and I’m much mistaken if Voldemort wants</p>
<p class="calibre1">his servant in the debt of Harry Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a>“I don’t want a connection with Pettigrew!” said Harry. “He betrayed my</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me</p>
<p class="calibre1">…  the  time  may  come  when  you  will  be  very  glad  you  saved  Pettigrew’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  couldn’t  imagine  when  that  would  be.  Dumbledore  looked  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though he knew what Harry was thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,” he said</p>
<p class="calibre1">gently. “He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  looked  up  at  him.  Dumbledore  wouldn’t  laugh  —  he  could  tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw myself across the lake … I thought I was seeing him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An easy mistake to make,” said Dumbledore softly. “I expect you’ll tire</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  hearing  it,  but  you  do  look   <i class="calibre3">extraordinarily</i>  like  James.  Except  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes … you have your mother’s eyes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was stupid, thinking it was him,” he muttered. “I mean, I knew he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  think  the  dead  we  loved  ever  truly  leave  us?  You  think  that  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t  recall  them  more  clearly  than  ever  in  times  of  great  trouble?  Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have</p>
<p class="calibre1">need of him. How else could you produce that  <i class="calibre3">particular</i> Patronus? Prongs</p>
<p class="calibre1">rode again last night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumbledore had said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last  night  Sirius  told  me  all  about  how  they  became  Animagi,”  said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore, smiling. “An extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  quiet  from  me.  And  then  I  remembered  the  most  unusual  form  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match</p>
<p class="calibre1">against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last</p>
<p class="calibre1">night. … You found him inside yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  Dumbledore  left  the  office,  leaving  Harry  to  his  very  confused</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Sirius,  Buckbeak,  and  Pettigrew  had  vanished  except  Harry,  Ron, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione,  and  Professor  Dumbledore.  As  the  end  of  term  approached, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a>Harry  heard  many  different  theories  about  what  had  really  happened,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">none of them came close to the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had</p>
<p class="calibre1">found  a  way  of  smuggling  the  hippogriff  to  safety,  and  seemed  outraged</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley, </p>
<p class="calibre1">meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius’s escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I manage to get into the Ministry, I’ll have a lot of proposals to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">about Magical Law Enforcement!” he told the only person who would listen</p>
<p class="calibre1">— his girlfriend, Penelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to</p>
<p class="calibre1">freedom,  Harry  had  never  approached  the  end  of  a  school  year  in  worse</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He certainly wasn’t the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin</p>
<p class="calibre1">go.  The  whole  of  Harry’s  Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts  class  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">miserable about his resignation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonder  what  they’ll  give  us  next  year?”  said  Seamus  Finnigan</p>
<p class="calibre1">gloomily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe a vampire,” suggested Dean Thomas hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t only Professor Lupin’s departure that was weighing on Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind.  He  couldn’t  help  thinking  a  lot  about  Professor  Trelawney’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">prediction.  He  kept  wondering  where  Pettigrew  was  now,  whether  he  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">sought  sanctuary  with  Voldemort  yet.  But  the  thing  that  was  lowering</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he would be living</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Sirius from now on … his parents’ best friend. … It would have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  next  best  thing  to  having  his  own  father  back.  And  while  no  news  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius was definitely good news, because it meant he had successfully gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">into hiding, Harry couldn’t help feeling miserable when he thought of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">home he might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  exam  results  came  out  on  the  last  day  of  term.  Harry,  Ron,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  had  passed  every  subject.  Harry  was  amazed  that  he  had  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  Potions.  He  had  a  shrewd  suspicion  that  Dumbledore  might  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape’s behavior toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  over  the  past  week  had  been  quite  alarming.  Harry  wouldn’t  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought  it  possible  that  Snape’s  dislike  for  him  could  increase,  but  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape’s thin</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p313"></a>mouth  every  time  he  looked  at  Harry,  and  he  was  constantly  flexing  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry’s throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy  had  got  his  top-grade  N.E.W.T.s;  Fred  and  George  had  scraped  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">handful  of  O.W.L.s  each.  Gryffindor  House,  meanwhile,  largely  thanks  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  spectacular  performance  in  the  Quidditch  Cup,  had  won  the  House</p>
<p class="calibre1">championship  for  the  third  year  running.  This  meant  that  the  end  of  term</p>
<p class="calibre1">feast  took  place  amid  decorations  of  scarlet  and  gold,  and  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated. Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  managed  to  forget  about  the  journey  back  to  the  Dursleys  the  next</p>
<p class="calibre1">day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  Hogwarts  Express  pulled  out  of  the  station  the  next  morning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve decided to drop Muggle Studies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!” said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” sighed Hermione, “but I can’t stand another year like this one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  Time-Turner,  it  was  driving  me  mad.  I’ve  handed  it  in.  Without</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muggle  Studies  and  Divination,  I’ll  be  able  to  have  a  normal  schedule</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  still  can’t   <i class="calibre3">believe</i>  you  didn’t  tell  us  about  it,”  said  Ron  grumpily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re supposed to be your  <i class="calibre3">friends. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I promised I wouldn’t tell  <i class="calibre3">anyone, </i>” said Hermione severely. She looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">around at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mountain. Two whole months before he’d see it again. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, cheer up, Harry!” said Hermione sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m okay,” said Harry quickly. “Just thinking about the holidays.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I’ve been thinking about them too,” said Ron. “Harry, you’ve got</p>
<p class="calibre1">to come and stay with us. I’ll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I’ll call you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I know how to use a fellytone now —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A  <i class="calibre3">telephone, </i> Ron,” said Hermione. “Honestly,  <i class="calibre3">you</i> should take Muggle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Studies next year. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron ignored her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come</p>
<p class="calibre1">and stay, and we’ll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a>“Yeah  …  I  bet  the  Dursleys’d  be  pleased  to  let  me  come  …  especially</p>
<p class="calibre1">after what I did to Aunt Marge. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in</p>
<p class="calibre1">several  games  of  Exploding  Snap,  and  when  the  witch  with  the  tea  cart</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived,  he  bought  himself  a  very  large  lunch,  though  nothing  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocolate in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  it  was  late  in  the  afternoon  before  the  thing  that  made  him  truly</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy turned up. …</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. “What’s that</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing outside your window?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  turned  to  look  outside.  Something  very  small  and  gray  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look</p>
<p class="calibre1">and saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted</p>
<p class="calibre1">this way and that in the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat</p>
<p class="calibre1">and began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself  for  accomplishing  its  task.  Hedwig  clicked  her  beak  with  a  sort  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dignified  disapproval.  Crookshanks  sat  up  in  his  seat,  following  the  owl</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his great yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of harm’s way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the</p>
<p class="calibre1">letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it aloud!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear Harry, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don’t know</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">whether they’re used to owl post. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in case this owl falls</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but he is the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a hope</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">of  finding  me  here.  I  am  planning  to  allow  some  Muggles  to  glimpse  me</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will be</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">lifted. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p315"></a> <i class="calibre3">There  is  something  I  never  got  around  to  telling  you  during  our  brief</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt</i> —</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I  <i class="calibre3">told</i> you it was from him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron. “Ouch!” The tiny owl, </p>
<p class="calibre1">now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed to think was an affectionate way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please consider</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">it as thirteen birthdays’ worth of presents from your godfather. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that night</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">last  year  when  you  left  your  uncle’s  house.  I  had  only  hoped  to  get  a</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">alarmed you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">year at Hogwarts more enjoyable. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’ll write again soon. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry  looked  eagerly  inside  the  envelope.  There  was  another  piece  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  contented  as  though  he’d  swallowed  a  bottle  of  hot  butterbeer  in  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">gulp. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I,  Sirius  Black,  Harry  Potter’s  godfather,  hereby  give  him  permission</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">to visit Hogsmeade on weekends. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily. He looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">back at Sirius’s letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on, there’s a P.S. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault he</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">no longer has a rat. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a>“Keep  him?”  he  said  uncertainly.  He  looked  closely  at  the  owl  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks to sniff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks purred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cross  station.  It  was  still  clutched  tightly  in  his  hand  as  he,  Ron,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione  stepped  back  through  the  barrier  of  platform  nine  and  three-</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarters.  Harry  spotted  Uncle  Vernon  at  once.  He  was  standing  a  good</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.  Weasley  hugged  Harry  in  greeting,  his  worst  suspicions  about  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed confirmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hermione  good-bye,  then  wheeled  the  trolley  bearing  his  trunk  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  that?”  he  snarled,  staring  at  the  envelope  Harry  was  still</p>
<p class="calibre1">clutching  in  his  hand.  “If  it’s  another  form  for  me  to  sign,  you’ve  got</p>
<p class="calibre1">another —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Godfather?” sputtered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  I  have,”  said  Harry  brightly.  “He  was  my  mum  and  dad’s  best</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend. He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of wizard prison and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though … keep up with</p>
<p class="calibre1">my news … check if I’m happy. …” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,  grinning  broadly  at  the  look  of  horror  on  Uncle  Vernon’s  face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for what looked like a much better summer than the last. </p>
