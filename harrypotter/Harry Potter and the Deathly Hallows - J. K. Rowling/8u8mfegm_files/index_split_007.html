<p class="calibre1">“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower’s flight to the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do it?” she added, and there was definite longing in her voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s obvious?” asked Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, “I know what you are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re. . . you’re a witch,” whispered Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked affronted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p562"></a>562</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles, as though it was the safe place in tag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are,” said Snape to Lily. “You are a witch. I’ve been watching you for a while. But there’s nothing wrong with that. My mum’s one, and I’m a wizard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petunia’s laugh was like cold water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance. “I know who you are. You’re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s End by the river,” she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why have you been spying on us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haven’t been spying,” said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. “Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,” he added spitefully, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“you’re a Muggle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape’s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I have done magic outside school!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let you off when you’re a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p563"></a>563</p>
<p class="calibre1">kid and you can’t help it. But once you’re eleven,” he nodded importantly, “and they start training you, then you’ve got to go careful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, “It is real, isn’t it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the letter, you and me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” whispered Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brim-ful of confidence in his destiny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Normally,” said Snape. “But you’re Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,” said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape. “I saw that. All the time I was watching you. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are things at your house?” Lily asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A little crease appeared between his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re not arguing anymore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p564"></a>564</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. “But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn’t your dad like magic?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Severus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A little smile twisted Snape’s mouth when she said his name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me about the dementors again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you want to know about them for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I use magic outside school—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You’re not going to end up in Azkaban, you’re too—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at Snape’s chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your mum’s blouse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a crack. A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tuney!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you make that happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” He looked both defiant and scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You did! You hurt her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p565"></a>565</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—no, I didn’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and three quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister. Harry moved closer to listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! Listen—” She caught her sister’s hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. “Maybe once I’m there—no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I’m there, I’ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t—want—to—go!” said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister’s grasp. “You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a—a. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners’ arms, over the owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—you think I want to be a—a freak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily’s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not a freak,” said Lily. “That’s a horrible thing to say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish. “A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy. . . weirdos, that’s what you two are. It’s good you’re being separated from normal people. It’s for our safety.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p566"></a>566</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petunia turned scarlet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beg? I didn’t beg!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I saw his reply. It was very kind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You shouldn’t have read—” whispered Petunia, “that was my private—how could you—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petunia gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—not sneaking—” Now Lily was on the defensive. “Severus saw the envelope, and he couldn’t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that’s all! He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” said Petunia, now as pale as she had been flushed. “Freak!” she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She threw him a look of deep dislike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So she’s my sister!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p567"></a>567</p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s only a—” He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slytherin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the choice?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">James lifted an invisible sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got a problem with that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. “If you’d rather be brawny than brainy—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p568"></a>568</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oooooo. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door slammed. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the scene dissolved once more. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, “Evans, Lily!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gryffindor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the scene changed. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were. A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p569"></a>569</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying, “Best friends?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round with! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary MacDonald the other day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that’s all—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s ill—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every month at the full moon?” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re doing at night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The intensity of his gaze made her blush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice. “And you’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever’s down there—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends’ too! You’re not going to—I won’t let you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me? Let me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p570"></a>570</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t mean—I just don’t want to see you made a fool of—He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. “And he’s not. . . everyone thinks. . . big Quidditch hero—” Snape’s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and Lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said, cutting across Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and Avery’s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how you can be friends with them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape’s step. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the scene dissolved. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again. . . He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape’s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “Mudblood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scene changed. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not interested.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Save your breath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p571"></a>571</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s too late. I’ve made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends—you see, you don’t even deny it! You don’t even deny that’s what you’re all aiming to be! You can’t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—listen, I didn’t mean—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—to call me Mudblood? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone. . . His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air. Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t kill me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was not my intention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—no message—I’m here on my own account!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his straggling</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p572"></a>572</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">black hair flying around him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I come with a warning—no, a request—please—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What request could a Death Eater make of me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The—the prophecy. . . the prediction. . . Trelawney. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything—everything I heard!” said Snape. “That is why—it is for that reason—he thinks it means Lily Evans!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore. “It spoke of a boy born at the end of July—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down—kill them all—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have—I have asked him—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little, “You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her—them—safe. Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what will you give me in return, Severus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In—in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p573"></a>573</p>
<p class="calibre1">lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought. . . you were going. . . to keep her. . . safe. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s breathing was shallow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone. . . dead. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is this remorse, Severus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wish. . . I wish I were dead. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s words appeared to take a long time to reach him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What—what do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily’s son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very well. But never—never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear. . . especially Potter’s son. . . I want your word!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?” Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished face. “If you insist. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p574"></a>574</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. “Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” murmured Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karkaroff ’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.” Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore’s crooked-nosed profile. “Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. “And are you tempted to join him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating figures. “I am not such a coward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now Harry stood in the headmaster’s office yet again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore’s eyelids fluttered and opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “why did you put on that ring? It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p575"></a>575</p>
<p class="calibre1">carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore grimaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I. . . was a fool. Sorely tempted. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tempted by what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore did not answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded furious. “That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you more time!” said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. “Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something like that. . . I was delirious, no doubt. . . ” said Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair. “Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p576"></a>576</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore’s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius’s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a short pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape gave a stiff nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius’s position.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort’s wrath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are you intending to let him kill you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly not. You must kill me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p577"></a>577</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I daresay the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,” he indicated his withered hand, “we can be sure that it will happen within a year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you don’t mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not have it ripped apart on my account.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year’s league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved—I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore seemed satisfied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Severus. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?” Snape asked abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore looked weary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why? You aren’t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He is his father over again—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother’s. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p578"></a>578</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Information,” repeated Snape. “You trust him. . . you do not trust me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And why may I not have the same information?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which I do on your orders!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord’s mind!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore. “Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Souls? We were talking of minds!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After you have killed me, Severus—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. “You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p579"></a>579</p>
<p class="calibre1">you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were back in Dumbledore’s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what must he do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a time—after my death—do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell him what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So the boy. . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p580"></a>580</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought. . . all those years. . . that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up. “You have used me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meaning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After all this time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Always,” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s departure from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p581"></a>581</p>
<p class="calibre1">his aunt and uncle’s,” said Dumbledore. “Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry’s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly. . . I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured, “that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It’s the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. . . A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed and hit George instead—</p>
<p class="calibre1">And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words:</p>
<p class="calibre1">could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind’s going, personally! Lots of love, Lily</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p582"></a>582</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do not use that word!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor—and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s mind and see you acting for him—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give Potter the sword?” said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “He will know what to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley’s mishap—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape turned at the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry, Dumbledore,” he said coolly. “I have a plan. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room; Snape might just have closed the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p583"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 34</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Forest Again</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,thetruth.Lyingwithhisfacepressedintothedustycarpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could survive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It 583</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p584"></a>584</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 34. THE FOREST AGAIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had left number four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble phoenix-feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved. . . . He envied even his parents’ deaths now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were all empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had never questioned that his own assumption: that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now h saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not me a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind’s eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p585"></a>585</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it. . . . Ron and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course. . . . That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must doe. I must die. It must end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed. He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime’s beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the office door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was only half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p586"></a>586</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 34. THE FOREST AGAIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what? I can manage him along, Neville,” said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder if a fireman’s lift and carried him into the Great Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off down the stops again into the darkness to recover more bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry. “There’s something I’ve got to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Listen—Neville—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” Neville looked suddenly scared. “Harry, you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” Harry lied easily. “’Course not . . . this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s name, Neville? He’s got a huge snake. . . . Calls it Nagini . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve heard, yeah. . . . What about it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p587"></a>587</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again; This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville will take Harry’s place. There would still be three in the secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just in case they’re—busy—and you get the chance—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kill the snake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kill the snake,” Harry repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, Harry, You’re okay, are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry swing the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone eyes was moving not far away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all right,” Ginny was saying. “It’s okay. We’re going to get you inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I want to go home,” whispered the girl. “I don’t want to fight anymore!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke. “It’s going to be all right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ripples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He wanted to shout out to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p588"></a>588</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 34. THE FOREST AGAIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she had seen someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had no strength left for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I open at the close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, “I am about to die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco’s wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p589"></a>589</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the stone were still discernible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthly, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes and looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him, and on each face, there was the same loving smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at him enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve been so brave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are nearly there,” said James. “Very close. We are . . . so proud of you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does it hurt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p590"></a>590</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 34. THE FOREST AGAIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">The childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips before he could stop it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dying? Not at all,” said Sirius. “Quicker and easier than falling asleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he will want to be quick. He wants it over,” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t want you to die,” Harry said. These words came without his voli-tion. “Any of you. I’m sorry—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—right after you’d had your son . . . Remus, I’m sorry—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am sorry too,” said Lupin. “Sorry I will never know him . . . but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at Harry’s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll stay with me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Until the very end,” said James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are part of you,” said Sirius. “Invisible to anyone else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at his mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay close to me,” he said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he self off. The dementors’ chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason he was about to keep putting one foot in front of the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p591"></a>591</p>
<p class="calibre1">more real to him now that the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">A thud and a whisper. Some other living creature had stirred close by Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone there,” came a rough whisper close at hand. “He’s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree; Their wands flared and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely heard something,” said Yaxley. “Animal, d’you reckon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,” said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yaxley looked down at his watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time’s nearly up. Potter’s had his hour. He’s not coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he was sure he’d come! He won’t be happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better go back,” said Yaxley, “Find out what the plan is now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p592"></a>592</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 34. THE FOREST AGAIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blonde Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated an terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind him head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix had spoken; She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. “I expected him to come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. He hands were swearing as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was, it seems . . . mistaken,” said Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You weren’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster. He did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p593"></a>593</p>
<p class="calibre1">numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared at Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then a voice yelled, “HARRY! NO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE YEH—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“QUIET!” shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid was silenced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemort’s head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made not attempt to draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter,” he said very softly His voice might have been part of the splitting fire. “The Boy Who Lived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p594"></a>594</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 34. THE FOREST AGAIN</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p595"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 35</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">King’s Cross</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Helayfacedown,listeningtothesilence.Hewasperfectlyalone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He lay in a bright mist, through it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">595</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p596"></a>596</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 35. KING’S CROSS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slight indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time, he wished he were clothed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took them and put them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noise. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You cannot help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p597"></a>597</p>
<p class="calibre1">and undamaged. “You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’re dead.” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then . . . I’m dead too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. “That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not?” repeated Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not,” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But . . . ” Harry raised his hand instinctively towards the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. “But I should have died—I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the difference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably, content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Explain,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So the part of his soul that was in me . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . has it gone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p598"></a>598</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 35. KING’S CROSS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that, Professor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again “and nobody died for me this time—how can I be alive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If this was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He took my blood.” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He tethered you to life while he lives!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I live . . . while he lives! But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you sure we can’t do anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is no help possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then explain . . . more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p599"></a>599</p>
<p class="calibre1">he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you knew this? You knew—all along?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As to that, I cannot be sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, had dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p600"></a>600</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 35. KING’S CROSS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had never expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He killed me with your wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I think we can agree you are not dead—though, of course,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p601"></a>601</p>
<p class="calibre1">were severe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around. “Where would you say that we are?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. “Good gracious, really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a little defensively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remember a much more pressing question than that of their current location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you forgive me?” he said. “Can you forgive me for not trusting you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desperate man’s dream!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But they’re real!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p602"></a>602</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 35. KING’S CROSS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore. “And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do I know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in his brilliantly blue eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course—how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. “Hallows, not Horcruxes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hallows,” mumbled Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes. Precisely” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly. “Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p603"></a>603</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore smiled at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It explained so much of his undetected wrong-doing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His tone was unbearably bitter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,” Harry said quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. “You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I don’t despise you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then you should,” said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. “You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I resented it, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p604"></a>604</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 35. KING’S CROSS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. “I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, in-flamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone—to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p605"></a>605</p>
<p class="calibre1">insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I had pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!” burst out Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p606"></a>606</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 35. KING’S CROSS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were the best—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think he knew it. I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p607"></a>607</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After another short pause Harry said, “You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts—the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons—I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deadly Hallows. I had proved it time and again, and here was the final proof.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” said Harry. “It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What’s wrong with that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest one of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did you have to make it so difficult?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if pre-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p608"></a>608</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 35. KING’S CROSS</p>
<p class="calibre1">sented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you expected him to go after the wand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work as I had intended, did it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p609"></a>609</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is up to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got a choice?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in King’s Cross, you say? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . board a train.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And where would it take me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On,” said Dumbledore simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you want me to go back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think,” said Dumbledore, ”that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p610"></a>610</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 35. KING’S CROSS</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears even though the bright white mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Flaw in the Plan</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Hewaslyingfacedownonthegroundagain.Thesmelloftheforest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had been knocked sideways by the fall, cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir but remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord . . . my Lord . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That will do,” said Voldemort’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Des-611</p>

<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">perate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a millimeter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord, let me—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. “The boy . . . Is he dead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,” said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry’s face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest, and felt his heart. He could hear the woman’s fast breathing, her long hair tickled his face. He knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his ear, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he breathed back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p613"></a>613</p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt the hand on his chest contract; her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. “Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort’s victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air: His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,” said Voldemort, “we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No—Wait—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moment Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You carry him,” Voldemort said, “He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses—put on the glasses—he must be recognizable—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone slammed Harry’s glasses onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid’s arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p614"></a>614</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“BANE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry’s eyes open. “Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn’ fight, yeh cowardly bunch o’ nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s—d-dead . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by the freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort’s command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father’s stag kept guardian in his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p615"></a>615</p>
<p class="calibre1">swelled through the grounds, crashing upon Harry’s eardrums. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anybody who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” sobbed Hagrid. “Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Death Eaters came to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid’s arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p616"></a>616</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall’s despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry’s death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini’s head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! HARRY!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s, Hermione’s, and Ginny’s voices were worse than McGonagall’s; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eaters, until—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upon them all. “It’s over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. “Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said Voldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, “killed while trying to save himself—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p617"></a>617</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw the figure hit the ground, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger’s wand aside and laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. “Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man’s-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. “But you are a pureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled into fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what if I am?” said Neville loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,” he said quietly, “be it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” said Voldemort. “There will be no more Houses. The emblem, shield, and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone. Won’t they, Neville Longbottom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p618"></a>618</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">hat onto Neville’s head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act—</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then many things happened at the same moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort’s giants: They ran at Grawp like bull ele-phants, making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle—</p>
<p class="calibre1">The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then, over the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid’s yell came loudest of all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p619"></a>619</p>
<p class="calibre1">“HARRY!” Hagrid shouted. “HARRY—WHERE’S HARRY?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants’ stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort’s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them, and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shouting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort’s would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The centaurs Ban, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din: “Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of the house-elves! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p620"></a>620</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past struggling prisoners, and into the Great Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry’s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms. Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OUT OF MY WAY!” shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p621"></a>621</p>
<p class="calibre1">swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley’s wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange’s smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches’ feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. “Get back! Get back! She is mine!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced around her. “When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—will—never—touch—our—children—again!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes began to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Protego!” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of “Harry!” “HE’S</p>
<p class="calibre1">ALIVE!” were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p622"></a>622</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want anyone else to try to help.” Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. “It’s got to be like this. It’s got to be me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort hissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. “That isn’t how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taunt and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. “You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accidents!” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. “Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other’s eyes, green into red. “You won’t be able to kill any of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you did not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—I meant to, and that’s what it did. I’ve done what my mother did. They’re</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p623"></a>623</p>
<p class="calibre1">protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch them. You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You dare—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I dare,” said Harry. “I know things you don’t know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it love again?” said Voldemort, his snake’s face jeering. “Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cock-roach, Potter—and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you from dying now when I strike?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort, “you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. “Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You mean he was weak!” screamed Voldemort. “Too weak to dare, too weak</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p624"></a>624</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">to take what might have been his, what will be mine!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore is dead!” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though they would cause him unendurable pain. “His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle. I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">”Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but you didn’t have him killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What childish dream is this?” said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Severus Snape wasn’t yours,” said Harry. “Snape was Dumbledore’s Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you can’t understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other, like wolves about to tear each other apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” said Harry,“the same as my mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You should have realized,” he said as he saw Voldemort’s nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever since! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It matters not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p625"></a>625</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy—I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up, I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contact to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You dare—?” said Voldemort again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He never defeated Dumbledore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He killed—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p626"></a>626</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">with him, because it had never been won from him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against its last master’s wishes! It’s power is mine!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard. . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p627"></a>627</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Avada Kedavra!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Expelliarmus!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of a Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hands, staring down at his enemy’s shell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspend: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Spout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last—</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to on one. He must speak to the bereaved, clap their hands, witness their tears, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p628"></a>628</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">receive their thanks, hear the new now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were through food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d want some peace and quite, if it were me,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d love some,” he replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And before he could say a word she cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s me,” he muttered, crouching down between them. “Will you come with me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stood up at once, and together he, Ron, and Hermione left the Great</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p629"></a>629</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade was gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition: We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. “Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Feel free.” groaned the statue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort—</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and head mistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p630"></a>630</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 36. THE FLAW IN THE PLAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">other’s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm as phoenix song. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, “I dropped it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you agree?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then there’s this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want it.” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Ron Loudly. “Are you mental?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know it’s powerful,” said Ron wearily. “But I was happier with mine. So</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p631"></a>631</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touch it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said “Reparo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, “back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry. “And quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bead lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">Later</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Autumnseemedtoarrivesuddenlythatyear.Themorningofthe first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road towards the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large caged rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It won’t be long now, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I want to go now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way towards the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus’s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I won’t! I won’t be in Slytherin!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slyth—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">633</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p634"></a>634</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 37. EPILOGUE—NINETEEN YEARS LATER</p>
<p class="calibre1">But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll right to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immediately, capi-talizing on the momentary absence of his brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam which was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll find them,” said Ginny reassuringly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody’s faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up beside them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p635"></a>635</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione didn’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I’d have to Confund the examiner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but no pressure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look who it is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother’s brains.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, half amused. “Don’t try to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, “Don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p636"></a>636</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 37. EPILOGUE—NINETEEN YEARS LATER</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. “Just seen him! And guess what he’s doing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snogging Victoire!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was doing—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like Ron—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s snogging her!” James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married,” whispered Lily sarcastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Teddy would really be part of the family then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind sharing a room with Al—Teddy could have my room!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry firmly, “you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He checked the battered old watch which had once been Fabian Prewett’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told James as she hugged him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mum! I can’t give a professor love!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you know Neville!—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">James rolled his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t he? I can’t walk into Herbology and give him love. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p637"></a>637</p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told Albus. “They’re gentle things, there’s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages, you’ll be going in the boats.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny kissed Albus good-by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you at Christmas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t forget Hagrid’s invited you to tea next Friday. Don’t mess with Peeves. Don’t duel anyone till you’ve learned how. And don’t let James wind you up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What if I’m in Slytherin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But just say—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It did for me,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p638"></a>638</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 37. EPILOGUE—NINETEEN YEARS LATER</p>
<p class="calibre1">scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned towards Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are they staring?” demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to look at the other students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely famous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereave-ment, watching his son glide away from him. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know he will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well. </p>
