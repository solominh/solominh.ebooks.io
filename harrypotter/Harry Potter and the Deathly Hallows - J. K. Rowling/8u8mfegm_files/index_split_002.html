<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come back up here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“R.A.B. I think I’ve found him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In your mum’s letter? But I didn’t see—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus’s sign. She read it, then clutched Harry’s arm so tightly that he winced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius’s brother?” she whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was a Death Eater,” said Harry. “Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave—so they killed him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That fits!” gasped Hermione. “If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, “Ron! RON! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Get up here, quick!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s up? If it’s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">He frowned at the sign on Regulus’s door, in which Hermione was silently pointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus Arcturus . . . Regulus</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . R.A.B.! The locket—you don’t reckon—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>164</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s find out,” said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked. Hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said, “Alohamora.” There was a click, and the door swung open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus’s bedroom was slightly smaller than Sirius’s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bead, the walls, and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, TOUJOURS PUR. Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re all about Voldemort,” she said. “Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph: a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row: He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He played Seeker,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort’s press clippings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the Seeker . . . Never mind,” said Harry, realizing that nobody was listening. Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers’ contents had been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills, out-of-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>165</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. She raised her wand and said, “Accio Locket!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that it, then? It’s not here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Charms to prevent it from being summoned magically, you know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said Harry, remembering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are we supposed to find it then?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We search manually,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination of the curtains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, finally, to conclude that the locket was not there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” said Hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs. As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become more determined. “Whether he’d manage to destroy it or not, he’d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn’t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket’s hiding place, even though we didn’t realize it at . . . at . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated: her eyes had even drifted out of focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . at the time,” she finished in a whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something wrong?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>166</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There was a locket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry and Ron together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we . . . we</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. He remembered. He had even handled the thing as they passed it around, each trying in turn to pry it open. It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,” said Harry. It was the only chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go. “He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">C’mon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake. They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius’s mother as they passed through the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!” she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door of Kreacher’s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept, but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, “Kreacher!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a loud crack and the house elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears. He was still wearing the filthy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>167</p>
<p class="calibre1">rag in which they had first met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and he bowed low; muttering to his knees, “back in my Mistress’s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I forbid you to call anyone ’blood traitor’ or ’Mudblood,”’ growled Harry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctively unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got a question for you,” said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf, “and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again. Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two years ago,” said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he said, “Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is it now?” asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful. Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reac-tions to his next word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone?” echoed Harry, elation floating out of him, “What do you mean, it’s gone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf shivered. He swayed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher,” said Harry fiercely, “I order you—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mundungus Fletcher,” croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. “Mundungus Fletcher stole it all; Miss Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s pictures, my Mistress’s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>168</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and the locket, Master Regulus’s locket. Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, he launched himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione’s scream mingled with Kreacher’s but Harry bellowed louder than both of them:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher, I order you to stay still!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, let him up!” Hermione whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. “I don’t think so. Right. Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth. “Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher’s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher’s treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-ran. . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You called the locket ’Master Regulus’s,”’ said Harry. “Why? Where did it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began to rock backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistress’s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper order; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>169</p>
<p class="calibre1">And one day, a year after he joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said . . . he said . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old elf rocked faster than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort needed an elf?” Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” moaned Kreacher. “And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do . . . and then to c-come home.” Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up. Kreacher’s croaking voice seemed to come to him from across the dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ . . . There was a boat . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux, by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf quaked from head to foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher drank, and as he drank he saw terrible thing . . . Kreacher’s insides burned . . . Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed . . . He made Kreacher drink all the potion . . . He dropped a locket into the empty basin . . . He filled it with more potion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>170</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort’s white, snakelike face vanishing into darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning poison caused its victim . . . But here, Harry’s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he drank from the black lake . . . and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know—but how did you escape the Inferi?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher did not seem to understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, but—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, Harry?” said Ron. “He Disapparated!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But . . . you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave,” said Harry, “otherwise Dumbledore—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said Ron, “I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice . . . It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The house-elf ’s highest law is his Master’s bidding,” intoned Kreacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home. . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then, you did what you were told, didn’t you?” said Hermione kindly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You didn’t disobey orders at all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>171</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what happened when you got back?” Harry asked. “What did Regulus say when you told him what happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,” croaked Kreacher. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . it was a little while later . . . Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell . . . and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so they had set off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat; this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he made you drink the poison?” said Harry, disgusted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione’s hands leapt to her mouth: She seemed to have understood something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“M—Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,” said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he order—Kreacher to leave—without him. And he told Kreacher—to go home—and never to tell my Mistress—what he had done—but to destroy—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the first locket. And he drank—all the potion—and Kreacher swapped the lockets—and watched . . . as Master Regulus . . . was dragged beneath the water</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . and . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Kreacher!” wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>172</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mistress say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told you not to call her ’Mudblood’!” snarled Harry, but the elf was already punishing himself. He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop him—stop him!” Hermione cried. “Oh, don’t you see now how sick it is, the way they’ve got to obey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher—stop, stop!” shouted Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snot, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never seen anything so pitiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you brought the locket home,” he said relentlessly, for he was determined to know the full story. “And you tried to destroy it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,” moaned the elf. “Kreacher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work. . . . So many powerful spells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open . . . Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears flowed down Hermione’s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who was no fan of Kreacher’s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying to clear it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said finally. “Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said Hermione, wiping her eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>173</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the back of her hand. “He’s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn’t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He’s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you’re going to say,” she went on as Harry began to protest, “that Regulus changed his mind . . . but he doesn’t seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus’s family were all safest if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it’s no good looking like that, you know it’s true. Kreacher had been alone for such a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I’m sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">’Miss Cissy’ and ’Miss Bella’ were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know. I’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did . . . and so did Sirius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius’s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher,” said Harry after a while, “when you feel up to it, er. . . . please sit up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into silence. Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>174</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">to find out where the locket—where Master Regulus’s locket it. It’s really important. We want to finish the work Master Regulus started, we want to—er—</p>
<p class="calibre1">ensure that he didn’t die in vain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Find Mundungus Fletcher?” he croaked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. “Do you think you could do that for us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid’s purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher, I’d, er, like you to have this,” he said, pressing the locket into the elf ’s hand. “This belonged to Regulus and I’m sure he’d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Overkill, mate,” said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione’s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack. </p>

<p class="calibre1">IfKreachercouldescapealakefullofInferi,Harrywasconfidentthat the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, an da supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigura-tions, did nothing to help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they cannot see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Death Eaters, for sure,” said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room windows. “Reckon they know we’re in here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think so,” said Hermione, though she looked frightened, “or they’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue tied by Moody’s curse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Hermione, “otherwise he’d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching to see whether we turn up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">175</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>176</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">They know that Harry owns the house, after all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do they—?” began Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They’ll know Sirius left you the place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelves. They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket. This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you stop it!” she cried out on the third evening of Kreacher’s absence, as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know I’m doing it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, like reading kids’ stories?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore left me this book, Ron—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice asked, “Severus Snape?” Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall, and rushed him, raising its dead hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>177</p>
<p class="calibre1">The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t move!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black. At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream, “Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hill below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Show yourself!” he called back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, all right.” said Harry, lowering his wand,“but I had to check, didn’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quit agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower your defenses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped i a thick black traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No sign of Severus then?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>178</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We know—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what’s happened after you left the Burrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the gate. A fire sprang up instantly. It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,” said Lupin. “So, you came straight here after the wedding?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a café on Tottenham Court Road.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s worrying, really worrying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing since Ron’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>179</p>
<p class="calibre1">dad told us the family were safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?” interjected Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Lupin. “There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Lupin went on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get to close—and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No deaths,” he added quickly, forstalling the question, “but they were rough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They burned down Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. They’re all right—shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?” Harry asked, remembering how effective those had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,” said Lupin. “They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they’d come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>180</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And are they bothering an excuse for torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people?” asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, “you’ll know sooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read the headline over it: WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any more: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?” asked Hermione furiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But surely people realize what’s going on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively heis the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the ministry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>181</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is not the point: They whisper. They daren’t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,” said Harry, “involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s certainly part of it,” said Lupin, “and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you—the Boy Who Lived—were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero’s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggleborns.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at page two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Muggle-born Register,”’ she read aloud, “‘The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called “Muggle-borns,” the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>182</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“People won’t let this happen,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is happening, Ron,’; said Lupin. “Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how are they supposed to have ’stolen’ magic?” said Ron. “It’s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs, would there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” said Lupin. “Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, “What if purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of their family? I’ll tell everyone Hermione’s my cousin—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You won’t have a choice,” said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. “I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione gave a shaky laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don’t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?” she asked Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” he replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye fro ma young age. And it’s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status—meaning that they have proven to the ministry that they are of wizard descent—before they are allowed to attend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spellbooks, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>183</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s . . . it’s . . . ” he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you confide in me what the mission is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t think I can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought you’d say that,” said Lupin, looking disappointed. “But I ought still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione, however, looked puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what about Tonks?” she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about her?” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Hermione, frowning, “you’re married: How does she feel about you going away with us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tonks will be perfectly safe.” said Lupin. “She’ll be at her parents’ house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remus,” said Hermione tentatively, “is everything all right . . . you know</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . between you and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>184</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything is fine, thank you,” said Lupin pointedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant. “Tonks is going to have a baby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, how wonderful!” squealed Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent!” said Ron enthusiastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congratulations,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, “So</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed my your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just—just to be clear,” he said. “You want to leave Tonks at her parents’</p>
<p class="calibre1">house and come away with us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,” said Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference. “Harry, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Harry slowly, “I’m not. I’m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid, actually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin’s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Explain, then,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin swallowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and I have regretted it very much ever since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see,” said Harry, “so you’re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>185</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the wolf upon his human face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have only seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, when parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child—the child—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it—how can I forgive myself when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remus!” whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. “Don’t say that—how could any child be ashamed of you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,” said Harry. “I’d be pretty ashamed of him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,” Harry said, “what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How—how dare you?” said Lupin. “This is not about a desire for—for danger of personal glory—how dare you suggest such a—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil.” Harry said, “You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoe—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>186</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, no!” Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin’s livid face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d never have believed this,” Harry said. “The man who taught me to fight dementors—a coward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remus, Remus, come back!” Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” wailed Hermione. “How could you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was easy,” said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t look at me like that!” he snapped at Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you start on her!” snarked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—no—we mustn’t fight!” said Hermione, launching herself between them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” Ron told Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He had it coming to him,” said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother’s voice, begging for mercy . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Parents,” said Harry, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless—unless they’ve got to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry—” said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>187</p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, you shouldn’t,” said Ron at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he’s acting like one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All the same . . . ” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” said Harry. “but if it makes him go back to Tonks, it’ll be worth it, won’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione’s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words, his mind was still full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twin-kle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he’d see as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth were matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but oth-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>188</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">erwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus’s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter’s strange escape from You-Know-Who. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric’s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband’s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,” says Bathilda Bagshot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The first year they wre there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn’t have known there was a daughter if I hadn’t been picking Plangen-tines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn’t know what to make of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric’s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>189</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana’s existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them: “My sister is too frail for school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts—the Prizes and the Pretense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? </p>
<p class="calibre1">How could he find out? He wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him; he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron’s and Hermione’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feat as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, “Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Expelliarmus!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby–tackled him, and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>190</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron’s grip. “Wha’ve I done? Setting a bleedin’ ’ouse-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, or—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus’s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair was matted and his robes stained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,” croaked the elf. “Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve done really well, Kreacher,” said Harry, and the elf bowed low. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an’ that was bleedin’ You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there, I said all along I didn’t wanna do it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you’re a bunch of bleeidin’ ’eroes then, aren’t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing myself—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-eye,” said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes. “We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, why the ’ell am I being ’unted down by ’ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblet again? I ain’t got none of ’em left, or you could ’ave ’em—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer,” said Harry. “Shut up and listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth. Harry’s wand was now so close to the bridge</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>191</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When you cleaned out his house of anything valuable,” Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirius never cared about any of the junk—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Call ’im off, call ’im off, ’e should be locked up!” screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kreacher, no!” shouted Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher’s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the honors,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much, Master,” said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,” Harry began again, “you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.” Harry’s mouth was suddenly dry. He could sense Ron and Hermione’s tensions and excitement too. “What did you do with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” asked Mundungus, “Is it valuable?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve still got it!” cried Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, he hasn’t,” said Ron shrewdly. “He’s wondering whether he shoulder have asked more money for it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More?” said Mundungus, “that wouldn’t have been effing difficult . . . bleedin’</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave it away, di’n’ I? No choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was selling in Diagon Alley, and she come up to me and asks if I’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop. She was gonna fine me, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>192</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 11. THE BRIBE</p>
<p class="calibre1">but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me she’d take it and let me off this time, and to fink meself lucky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who was this woman?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno, some Ministry hag.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Little woman. Bow on top of her head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He frowned, then added, “Looked like a toad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aguamenti!” screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron’s and Hermione’s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">AsAugustworeon,thesquareofunkemptgrassinthemiddleof Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelves were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses,and nor was the number twelve itself. The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railing facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in the heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">193</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>194</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain, for the first time in weeks, there occurred one oft hose inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The usual low whisper of “Severus Snape” greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t kill you,” he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs into the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, “I’ve got news, and you won’t like it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a mer-rily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus’s locket bouncing on his thin chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>195</p>
<p class="calibre1">on a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand, drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read: SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrows will will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values—’ Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study—Merlin’s pants!” she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must be upset.” He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top off the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it’s all friends together. And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, “I can’t see that the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>196</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it’ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban—and that’s if they’re lucky. I reckon they’ll stay to try and protect the students.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape’s face. “Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher’s cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus’s locket: Today’s French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,” he told Ron as he ate, “more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron glanced at his watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his mind’s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape’s new regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry said. “I landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. “And what in the name of Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I remembered this,” Hermione panted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside, and despite the fact that it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>197</p>
<p class="calibre1">was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much else, into the bag’s capricious depths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phineas Nigellus,” Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry?” said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore’s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,” Hermione explained to Ron as he resumed her seat. “But let him try now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. “So, Harry, what else happened today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance for seven house. No sign of her. Saw you dad, though, Ron. He looks fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,” Ron said. “That’s why we haven’t seen Umbridge, she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?” Hermione asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” Hermione asked, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>198</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">her soup spoon suspended in midair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you never told us that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!” she said, flipping feverishly through the pages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, doe sit really matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, it all matters! If we’re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We’ve been over and over this, I mean, what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t even bothering to tell us—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tomorrow?” repeated Hermione. “You aren’t serious, Harry?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am,” said Harry. “I don’t think we’re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There’s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t open.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unless,” said Ron, “she’s found a way of opening it and she’s now possessed,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t make any difference to her, sh e was so evil in the first place,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We know everything important,” Harry went on, addressing Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We know they’ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>199</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge’s office is, because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I’ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,”’ Hermione recited immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,” said Harry. “And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we haven’t got any!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I the plan works, we will have,” Harry continued calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know. . . . There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,” said Harry. “It’s time to act.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could tell from Ron’s and Hermione’s faces that they were scared, he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied on upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody’s briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” said Ron slowly, “let’s say we go for it tomorrow. . . . I think it should just be me and Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione. “I thought we’d settled this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different, Hermione.” Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dared ten days previously. “You’re on the list of Muggle-borns who didn’t present</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>200</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves for interrogation!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If ayone shouldn’t go, it’s Harry, he’s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine, I’ll stay here,” said Harry. “Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry’s forehead. His hand jumped to it: He saw Hermione’s eyes narrow; and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if all three of us go we’ll have to Disapparate separately,” Ron was saying. “We can’t all fit under the Cloak anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute-er-bathroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He felt a mounting excitement. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry’s face, humor gone, terror replacing it. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gregorovitch?” said a high, cold voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want Gregorovitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!” she cried, shaking her head. “He no live here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He no live here! I know him not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>201</p>
<p class="calibre1">Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Das welfs ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He raised the wand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! HARRY!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, 9open up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you doing?” asked Hermione sternly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you think I was doing?” asked Harry with feeble bravado. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were yelling your head off?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah . . . I must’ve dozed off or—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said Hermione, taking deep breaths. “We know your scar hurt downstairs, and you’re white as a sheet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat down on the edge of the bath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine, I’ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he’s probably killed her whole family. And he didn’t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry;, you aren’t supposed to let this happen anymore!” Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. “Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! He thought the connection was dangerous—Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because it means I know what he’s doing,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>202</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you’re not even going to try to shut him out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, I can’t. You know I’m lousy at Occlumency, I never got the hang of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You never really tried!” she said hotly. “I don’t get it, Harry—do you like having this special connection or relationship or what—whatever—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like it?” he said quietly. “Would you like it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—no—I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he’s most dangerous. But I’m going to use it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else’s. I want to know why he’s after Gregorovitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s a foreign wandmaker,” said Harry. “He made Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But according to you,” said Ron, “Voldemort’s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he’s already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better . . . or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn’t know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,” said Hermione, “but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>203</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort’s mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To his relief, Ron intervened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drop it,” he advised her. “It’s up to him. And if we’re going to the ministry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we should go over the plan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius’s room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not for long,” said Harry, yawning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging her presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, “Polyjuice potion</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . Invisibility Cloak . . . Decoy Detonators . . . You should each take a couple just in case. . . . Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable ears . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>204</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bless him,” said Ron fondly, “and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins; the first ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight o’clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch. “She ought to be here in about five minutes. When I’ve Stunned her—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, we know,” said Ron sternly. “And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione squealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I nearly forgot! Stand back—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it look as though it was still closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And now,” she said, turning back to face the other two in the alley way, “we put on the Cloak again—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and we wait,” Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione’s head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness: the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione’s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>205</p>
<p class="calibre1">little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch’s handbag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. “You’d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch’s purse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They hurried to the close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and a small, ferrety—looking wizard appeared before them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, hello, Mafalda.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello!” said Hermione in a quavery voice. “How are you today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry to hear you’re under the heather,” said Hermione, talking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here, have a sweet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh? Oh, no thanks—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I insist!” said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles i his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>206</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. “Perhaps you’d better take the day off!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—no!” He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight. “I must—today—must go—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that’s just silly!” said Hermione, alarmed. “You can’t go to work in this state—I think you ought to go to St. Mungo’s and get them to sort you out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the main street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You simply can’t go to work like this!” cried Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his away back into a standing positions, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Urgh,” said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid the pud-dles of sick. “It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard’s bag, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn’t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, I’m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now wait here,” Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with some hairs for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We don’t know who he is,” Hermione said, passing Harry several curly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>207</p>
<p class="calibre1">black hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he’s pretty tall, you’ll need bigger robes. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall, and from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, that’s scary,” said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, “and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of steps, one labeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you in a moment, then,” said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning, Reg!” called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. “Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Harry’s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>208</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks like it,” Harry whispered back; he voice came out deep and gravelly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this was sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out of the way, can’t y—oh, sorry, Runcorn!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man whom Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Psst!” said a voice, and he looked around to see a wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You got in all right, then?” Hermione whispered to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, he’s still stuck in the bog,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, very funny . . . It’s horrible, isn’t it?” she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. “Have you seen what they’re sitting on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had though were deco-ratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved human: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the hand-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>209</p>
<p class="calibre1">somely robed wizards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Muggles,” whispered Hermione. “In their rightful place. Come on, let’s get going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, “Cattermole!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore’s death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their eyes downcast. Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The man’s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophanti-cally, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It’s still raining in there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Raining . . . in your office? That’s—that’s not good, is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley’s eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think it’s funny, Cattermole, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the list and bustled off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Ron, “no, of course—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole. In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She coughed feebly and turned away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>210</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 12. MAGIC IS MIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I—” stammered Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “—not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth—and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?’p’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” whispered Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, you wife’s Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than it is now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod an unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What am I going to do?” Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. “If I don’t turn up, my wife . . . I mean, Cattermole’s wife—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll come with you, we should stick together—” began Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s mental, we haven’t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I’ll go and sort out Yaxley’s office—but how do I stop it raining?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione at once, “that should stop the rain if it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t, something’s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say it again, slowly—” said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, “Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liason Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,” and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning, Albert,” said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>211</p>
<p class="calibre1">glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more: Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttered, “Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liai-son? Nice one, Albert, I’m pretty confident I’ll get his job now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Level two, Department of Magical law enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services,” said the disembodied witch’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione said, very fast, “Actually, Harry, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t think he knows what he’s doing and if he gets caught the whole thing—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of them in deep conversation: a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and a squat, toad-like witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Ah,Mafalda!”saidUmbridge,lookingatHermione.“Traverssent you, did he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y—yes,” squeaked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good, you’ll do perfectly well.” Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold. “That’s that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able to start straightaway.” She consulted her clipboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee!! Tut, tut</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . even here, in the heart of the Ministry!” She stepped into the lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening to Umbridge’s conversation with the Minister. “We’ll go straight down, Mafalda, and you’ll find everything you need in the courtroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good morning, Albert, aren’t you getting out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, of course,” said Harry in Runcorn’s deep voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stepped out of the lift. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione’s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge’s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">213</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>214 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What brings you up here, Runcorn?” asked the new Minister of Magic. His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Needed a quick word with,” Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Pius Thickness. “Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, his throat dry. “No, nothing like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, well. It’s only a matter of time,” said Thicknesse. “If you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good day, Minister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner’s name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. They ha concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected. They had not given a moment’s thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that has quarry had just gone down in the lift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>215</p>
<p class="calibre1">here; the purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her office must be up here, Harry thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern, and after a few more seconds he realized that what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets—that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">MUDBLOODS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">and the Dangers They Pose to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>216 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was no author’s name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her wand, “Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Careful,” said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“what, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared in him like a snake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood—an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving: It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">DOLORES UMBRIDGE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">SENIOR UNDERSECRETARY TO THE MINISTER</p>
<p class="calibre1">Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read: HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN</p>
<p class="calibre1">REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>217</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the doorknob, there came a long band and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. the young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge’s office, and closed the door behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge’s office at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies, and dried flowers covered every available surface. The walls bore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with a sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy, flowered cloth. Behind Mad-Eye’s eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. Then he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, and murmured, “Accio Locket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open drawers. He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a locket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">there was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to searching it. Like Filch’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search: Mr. Weasley’s file. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulled it out and opened it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ARTHUR WEASLEY</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>218 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>

<p class="calibre1">monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will contact (has stayed with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley family previously)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, “To be punished.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the office one last sweeping look and his heart skipped a beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry crossed the room and snatched it up, but realized the moment he touched it that it was not am mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book, Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat—The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore—</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>219</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest: “by Rita skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each other’s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a young doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the office opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement because for a moment or two he remained quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf. Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and begun scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in a pulled off the Invis-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>220 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">ibility Cloak as it started its descent. to his enormous relief, when it rattle to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, it’s me, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like—why isn’t Hermione with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn’t refuse, and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again. The doors opened and Mr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high that it resembled an anthill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ . . . I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, but I’m afraid I cannot be part to—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron’s robes. “Isn’t your wife in for questioning today? Er—what’s happened to you? Why are you so wet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yaxley’s office is raining,” said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley’s shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other’s eyes. “I couldn’t stop it, so they’ve sent me to get Bernie—Pillsworth, I think they said—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley. “Did you try Meterolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meterolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t. Thanks, D—I mean, thanks, Arthur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers he was reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>221</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One moment, Runcorn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, “I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry?” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely. “You down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—so what if I did?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower. “And if he survives Azkaban, you’ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arthur,” Harry interrupted, “you know you’re being tracked, don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that a threat, Runcorn?” said Mr. Weasley loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, “it’s a fact! They’re watching your every move—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn. . . . the lift doors clanged shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the doors opened, he stepped out into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood-paneled and carpeted corridors above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>222 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">court chambers. His mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, and eve if he managed it, Hermione’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the Ministry. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dementors, he thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black—</p>
<p class="calibre1">hooded figures, their faces completely hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors’ greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding up an down in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sense him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>223</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, I’m a half-blood, I’m a half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he’s a well-known broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you—get your hands off me, get your hands off—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is your final warning,” said Umbridge’s soft voice, magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate screams. “If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take him away,” said Umbridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be faint-ing. They glided away down the corridor with him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Next—Mary Cattermole,” called Umbridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long, plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed the dementors, Harry saw her shudder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for im-proper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>224 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">and down, up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit down,” said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Umbridge ignored her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re frightened, they think I might not come home—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, he felt the change in temperature: It was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge’s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. Slowly, and very carefully, he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m behind you,” he whispered into Hermione’s ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bot-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>225</p>
<p class="calibre1">tle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cattermole,” Umbridge was saying, “Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that description?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“T—took?” sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. “I didn’t t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it when I was eleven years old. It—it—it—chose me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She cried harder than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Umbridge, “no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here—Mafalda, pass them to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s hands were shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole’s name o nit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s—that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” snapped Umbridge, glancing down. “Oh yes—an old family heirloom,” she said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. “The S stands for Selwyn. . . . I am related to the Selwyns. . . . Indeed, there are few pure blood families to whom I am not related. . . . A pity,” she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole’s questionnaire, “that the same cannot be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>226 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">said for you. ‘Parents processions: greengrocers.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry’s brain and obliterated his sense of caution—that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to holster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, “Stupefy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole’s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry’s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: “Stupefy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the flood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak: down below, the dementors had moved out of their corners: they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry’s wand and leaped toward the dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag’s light, more powerful and more warming than the cat’s protection, filed the whole dungeon as it cantered around and around the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get the Horcrux,” Harry told Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak back into his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>227</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag, and approached Mrs. Cattermole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You?” she whispered, gazing into his face. “But—but Reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did I?” muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’ve had a change of heart. Diffindo!” Nothing happened. “Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait, I’m trying something up here—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone—I need to replicate it—Geminio! There . . . That should fool her. dots” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione came running downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s see. . . . Relashio!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole looked just as frightened as before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t understand,” she whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re going to leave here with us,” said Harry, pulling her to her feet. “Go home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you’ve got to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disguise yourselves and run. You’ve seen how it is, you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” said Hermione, “how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Patronuses,” said Harry, pointing his wand at his own: The stag slowed and walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door. “As many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Expec—Expecto patronum,” said Hermione. Nothing happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” Harry told a completely bemused Mrs. Cattermole. “Bit unfortunate, really . . . Come on, Hermione. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Expecto patronum!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione’s wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>228 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon,” said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside. Harry looked around: the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families.” Harry told the waiting Muggle-borns, who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering slightly. “Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That’s the—er—new official position. Now, if you’ll just follow the Patronuses, you’ll be able to leave from the Atrium.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted, but as they approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggleborns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reg!” screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron’s arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us to leave the country, I think we’d better do it, Reg, I really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children and—why are you so wet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Water,” muttered Ron, disengaging himself. “Harry, they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge’s office door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I reckon we’ve got five minutes of that—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, if we’re trapped here—!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We won’t be if we move fast,” said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s got wands?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">About half of them raised their hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself to someone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a>229</p>
<p class="calibre1">who has. We’ll need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry’s Patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Level eight,” said the cool witch’s voice, “Atrium.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” squeaked Hermione. “What are we going to—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“STOP!” Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium: The wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. “Follow me,” he whispered to the group of terrified Muggleborns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s up, Albert?” said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out of the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said Harry with all the authority he could muster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The group of wizard sin front of him looked at one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“are you contradicting me?” Harry blustered. “Would you like me to have you family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry!” gasped the balding wizard, backing away. “I didn’t mean nothing, Albert, but I thought . . . I thought they were in for questioning and . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Their blood is pure,” said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. “Purer than many of yours. I daresay Off you go,” he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and resentful. Then:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mary!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but pale and wan, and just come running out of a lift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“R-Reg?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>230 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey—what’s going on? What is this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seal the exit! SEAL IT!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” Harry shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, “My Wife! Who was that with my wife? What’s going on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Yaxley’s head turn, saw an inkling of truth dawn in that brutish face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over Harry’s head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door: Ron was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reg, I don’t understand—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around: Yaxley had just appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but something was wrong. . . . Hermione’s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>231</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the only solid things in the world were Ron’s arm and Hermione’s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he saw the door of number twelves, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple light. Hermione’s hand was suddenly vicelike upon his hand and everything went dark again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>232 CHAPTER 13. THE MUGGLE—BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Thief</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harryopenedhiseyesandwasdazzledbygoldandgreen:hehad no idea what had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming though a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but saw that the object was Ron’s foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forrest, and for a moment, even though eh knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leaped at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut. However, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron’s head. The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry’s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the 233</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>234</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 14. THE THIEF</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s happened to him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Splinched,” said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron’s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron’s shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron’s upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’—</p>
<p class="calibre1">” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bag—right—’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sped tot he place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quickly!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accio Dittany!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half—closed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s fainted,” said Hermione who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. “Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched over what had just</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>235</p>
<p class="calibre1">been open flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. “There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage. . . . He’s lost too much blood already. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did he get hurt? I mean”—Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place—“why are we here? I thought were were going back to Grimmauld Place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to go back there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn’t get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then—well, I think he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then, where’s he? Hang on. . . . You don’t mean he’s at Grimmauld Place? He can’t get in there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I think he can. I—I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I’d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm’s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we’re Secret-Keepers, so I’ve given him the secret, haven’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>236</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 14. THE THIEF</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! If anything, it was mine. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye’s eye. Hermione recoiled, looking horrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn’t leave it there . . . but that’s how they knew there were intruders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still gray and his face glistened with sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How d’you feel?” Hermione whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lousy,” croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. ‘Where are we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said Hermione. “I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—the first place you thought of,” Harry finished for her, glancing around at the apparently deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of—how Death Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had taken them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you reckon we should move on?” Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell by the look on Ron’s face that he was thinking the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s stay here for now,” Harry said.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are we going?’ asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>237</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tent?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the bag!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the . . . of course,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did no bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?” he asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad,” said Hermione, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand, “so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!” she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of whose started hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cave Imunicium,” Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. “That’s as much as I can do. At the very least, we should know they’re coming. I can’t guarantee it will keep our Vol—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione looked at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but it feels like a—a jinx or something. Can’t we call him You-Know-Who—</p>
<p class="calibre1">please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore said fear of a name—” began Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn’t do Dumbledore much good in the end,” Ron snapped back. “Just—just show You-Know-Who some respect, will you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Respect?” Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>238</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 14. THE THIEF</p>
<p class="calibre1">condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it: a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. “As long as Mr. Cattermole had his withs about him, he’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. That’s what Harry told her to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. “I didn’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Azkaban because of us . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had wanted to ask—</p>
<p class="calibre1">about whether Mrs. Cattermole’s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband—died in his throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“so, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got—got what?” she said with a little start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where’s the locket?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>239</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You got it?” shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillow. “No one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren’t we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione. “Here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was as large as a chicken’s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent’s canvas roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?” asked Ron hopefully. “I mean, are we sure it’s still a Horcrux?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“there’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, pristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I reckon Kreacher’s right,” said Harry. “We’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke. even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus’s bedroom door. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you feel it, though?” Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his clenched fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>240</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 14. THE THIEF</p>
<p class="calibre1">he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are we going to do with it?” Hermione asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.” Harry replied, and, little though eh wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,” he added to Hermione, standing up and stretching. “And we’ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there,” he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, nothing the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food in her magical bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy: Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione’s feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. His insides, already</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>241</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt half, run out of road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark. He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him, relentlessly, Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: He could not. And it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. . . . Stupid idea, he told himself, don’t think that. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid he was making it happen by having these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He thought of poor Kreacher, who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry’s head and he tried to push these away too, for these was nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>242</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 14. THE THIEF</p>
<p class="calibre1">he could do for Kreacher. He and Hermione had already decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on elfish Apparition from being free of the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione’s sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not know: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn’t Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for centuries, perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. . . . Snape had seen to that. . . . Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Dumbledore had fallen . . . fallen . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give it to me, Gregorovitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-fingered white hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level with Harry’s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: a trussed-up Father Christmas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows. . . . He always knows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole—</p>
<p class="calibre1">And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch’s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a work-shop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. In the split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>243</p>
<p class="calibre1">from his wand and jumped neatly backwards out of the window with a crow of laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnel-like pupils and Gregorovitch’s face was stricken with terror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?” said the high cold voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do not know, I never know, a young man—no—please—PLEASE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out against the side of the tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dream,” he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione’s glower with a look of innocence. ‘Must’ve dozed off, sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking into Vol—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t say his name!” came Ron’s angry voice from the depths of the tent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,” retorted Hermione. “You-Know-Who’s mind, then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said. “It was a dream! Can you control what you dream about, Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you just learned to apply Occlumency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had just seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he’s killed him, but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch’s mind and I saw—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re falling asleep,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can finish the watch!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, you’re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>244</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 14. THE THIEF</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After several minutes, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s You-Know-Who doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.” </p>
