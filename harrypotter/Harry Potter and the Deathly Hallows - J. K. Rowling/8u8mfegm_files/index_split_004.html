<p class="calibre1">She saw Ron, who stoop there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron’s rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione slipped out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak, hopeful smile and half raised his arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p329"></a>329</p>
<p class="calibre1">that she could reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch—ow—gerroff! What the—? Hermione—OW!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—complete—arse—Ronald—Weasley!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his head as Hermione advanced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—crawl—back—here—after—weeks—and—weeks—oh, where’s my wand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry’s hands and he reacted instinctively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Protego!!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she leapt up again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione!” said Harry. “Calm—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. “Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, will you please—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!” she screeched. “Don’t you dare! Give it back now! And YOU!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and Harry could not blame Ron for retreating several steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” Ron said. “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh you’re sorry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You come back after weeks—weeks—and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, what else can I say?” Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a>330</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 19. THE SILVER DOE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I don’t know!” yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. “Rack your brains, Ron, that should only take a couple of seconds—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” interjected Harry who considered this a low blow, “he just saved my—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t care!” she screamed. “I don’t care what he’s done! Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. “Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been like—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What it’s been like for you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice was now so shirll only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a new level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speech-less, and Ron seized his opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn’t go anywhere!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione thew herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so rightly it seemd unlikely that she would unravel them for several years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snatchers,” said Ron. “They’re everywhere—gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggle-borns and blood traiter,s, there’s a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you say to them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And they believed that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They weren’t the brightest. One of them was definitely part-troll, the smell off him. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron glanced at Hermione. clearly hopeful she might soften at this small</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a>331</p>
<p class="calibre1">instance of humor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only one of me and they’d taken my wand. then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Diapparated. I didn’t do it so well, Splinched myself again”—Ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly—“and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we’d been . . . you’d gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gosh, what a gripping story,” Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound. “You must have been sipmly terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who’s snake turned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imaging losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our suffereings into perspective doesn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” said Harry quietly. “Ron just saved my life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She appeared not to have heard him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“one thing I would like to know, though,” she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron’s head. “How exactly did you find us tonight? That’s important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once we know, we’ll be able to make sure we’re not visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Deluminator?” she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It doesn’t just turn the lights on and off,” said Ron. “I don’t know how</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a>332</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 19. THE SILVER DOE</p>
<p class="calibre1">it works or why it happened then and not any other time, because I’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard . . . I heard you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was looking at Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,” he held up the Deluminator again, “came out of this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what exactly did I say?” asked Hermione, her tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My name. ’Ron.’ And you said . . . sometihng about a wand. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered. It had been the first time Ron’s name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left; Hermione had mentions it when talking about repairing Harry’s wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, “and it didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside my window.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluis, like that like you get around a Portkey, you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together automatically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and packed it then I put on my rucksack and wnet out into the garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it . . . well, it went inside me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry?” said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, “right into my chest, and then—it just went straight through. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a>333</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was here,” he touched a point close to his heart. “I could feel it, it was hot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And once it was inside me I knew where I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were there,” said Harry. “We spend two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron. “Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, actually, said Hermione. “We’ve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because as Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept hoping you’d appear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end—and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You saw the what?” said Hermione sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe nad the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it must have been a Patronus!” she said. “Couldn’t you see who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can’t believe this! Then what happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he had realized that sometihng was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the sword. He got as far as the opening of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a>334</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 19. THE SILVER DOE</p>
<p class="calibre1">the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and Ron stabbed it with the sword.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And . . . it went? Just like that?” she whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it—screamed,” said Harry with half a glance at Ron. “Here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deciding that it ws at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione’s wand and turned to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh—oh yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand out of its pocket. “Here. I figured it’s always handy to have a backup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were right,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “Mine’s broken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron passed Harry the new wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About the best you could hope four, I think,” murmured Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Ron. “Could’ve been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I still haven’t ruled it out,” came Hermione’s muffled voice from beneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 20</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">Xenophilius Lovegood</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">HarryhadnotexpectedHermione’sangertoabateovernight,and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning. Ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became shamelessly cheery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone helped us.” he kept saying. “Someone sent that doe. Someone’s on our side. One Horcrux down, mate!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits; The sudden upswing in their fortunes, they appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, Ron’s return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione’s baleful presence again, and under the pretense of scouting the bare hedges for nonexistent blackber-335</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a>336</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">ries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione’s various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric’s Hollow; Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his weeks away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ . . . and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he asked Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who’s name!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yeah. Well, it’s just a bad habit we’ve slipped into,” said Harry. “But I haven’t got a problem calling him V—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO!” roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a boot at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. “Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of hte brambles, “but the name’s been jinxed. Harry, that’s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance—it’s how they found us in Totenham Court Road!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because we used his name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly! You’ve got to give htem credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him like Dumbledore, who ever dared use it. Now they’ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable—quick-and-easy way to find they Order members! They nearly got Kingsley—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re kidding?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He’s on the run now, just like us.” Ron scratched his chin thoughfully with the end of his wand. “You don’t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry . . . you don’t reckon it could’ve been Dumbledore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a>337</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, “Dumbledore . . . the doe? I mean,” Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, “he had the real sword last, didn’t he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the body. He’s definitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Patronuses can change, though, can’t they?” said Ron. “Tonks’s changed, didn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he show himself? Why wouldn’t he just hand us the sword?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Search me,” said Ron. “Same reason he didn’t give it to you while he was alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids’</p>
<p class="calibre1">stories?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which is what?” asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face, desperate for the answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I dunno,” said Ron. “Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or—or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don’t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He—well,” Ron’s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“he must’ve known I’d run out on you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” Harry corrected him. “He must’ve know you’d always want to come back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry said, “Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah,” said Ron at once. “people are talking about it quite a lot. ’Course, if things were different, it’d be huge news. Dumbledore being pals with Grindel-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a>338</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">wald, but now it’s just something to laugh about for people who didn’t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who though he was such a good bloke. I don’t know that it’s such a big deal, though. He was really young when they—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against persuing the subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Engorgio.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The spider game a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry—Reducio.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far tha day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intru-sively unfamiliar, like having sombody else’s hand sown to the end of his arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. “It’s all a matter of confidence, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He knew why she wanted to be right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a>339</p>
<p class="calibre1">first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who’s side and are following the Ministry line, but this one . . . you wait till you hear it, it’s great. Only they can’t do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they’re raided, and you need a password to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the lsat one. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He drummed lightly on top of the radio with his wand, muttering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered. Hermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop!” he told Hermione nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to talk,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita’s verison of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione’s answer, however, was complet-edly unexpected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stared at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a>340</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er—why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, “It’s that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry’s unwilling eyes as he saw a photograph of the original letter than Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore’s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had writen those words, that they had not been Rita’s invention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the signature, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wang, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er—what are you—?” said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means—I don’t even know if Grindelwald’s stil alive—but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. he was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, “Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore’s left he The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we’re not supposed to find out about the sign?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here we go again!” Harry felt slightly exaperated. “We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up Ron. “I think</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a>341</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron’s support of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they’ve got to help you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe . . . maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,” said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yea,” said Ron syncophantically, “that makes sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think we ought to talke to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know about this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we should vote on it,” said Ron. “Those in favor of going to see Lovegood—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His hand flew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Outvoted, Harry, sorry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated. “Only, once we’ve seen Lovegood, let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? where do the Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron.. “I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention the,. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shouldn’t be hard to find.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a>342</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Cachpole from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and tree of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,” said Hermione coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wasn’t at the Burrow!” said Ron with and incredulous laugh. “Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d walked out on you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, and Fred and George woud’ve been great about it. And ginny, she’d have been really understanding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“VBut where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bill and Fleur’s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill’s always been decent to me. He—he wasn’t impressed when he heard what I’d done, but he didn’t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry. None of the rest of the family knew I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren’t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alonge. You know, first holiday after they were married. I don’t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron turned his back on the Burrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione’s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cotttage, which seemed deserted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?” said Hermione, peering thorugh the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there if you looked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>343</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the Lovegood’s window. Let’s try the next lot of hills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So the Disapparated a few miles farther north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whippped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s got to be Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they foun dhim grinning broadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down gate. The first read, </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE QUIBBLER, EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">the second, </p>
<p class="calibre1">PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE</p>
<p class="calibre1">the third, </p>
<p class="calibre1">KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry though he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, beat with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavery with berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened, hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a>344</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,” said Hermione. “It’s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She the rapped three times on th ethick black door, which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur’s wedding by comparision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” he cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect comical O. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “I’m Harry, Harry Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry’s forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. “There’s sometihng we’d like to ask you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I . . . I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. “Rather a shock . . . My word . . . I</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . I’m afraid I don’t really think I ought to—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It won’t take long,” said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less than warming welcome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">they were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind then. They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls—the stove, the sink, and the cupboards—and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry though he recognized Luna’s style: The effect in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p345"></a>345</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labryinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luna was not there; The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but after a moment Harry decided it was an old fashioned printing press, due to the fact that it was churning out Quibblers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me,” said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized a grubbly tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why have you come here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione lot out a small cry of shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Lovegood—what’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is the horm of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No it isn’t!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not the moment—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>346</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable Material and it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius very clearly, a mullish look upon his face, “is a shy and highly magical creature, and its horn—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibily dangerous—I don’t know where you got it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago, from a de-lightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,” he said, turning to Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Xenophilius. “Help. Hmm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His good eye moved again to Harry’s scar. He seems simultaneously terrified and mesmerized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. The this is . . . helping Harry Potter . . . rather dangerous . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help Harry?” said Ron. “In that magazine of yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er—yes, I have expressed that view. However—” “That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful interal struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione, “Let’s see what she thinks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p347"></a>347</p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, “Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She . . . she will like to see you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll go and call her and then—very well. I shall try to help you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. They looked at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cowardly old wart,” said Ron. “Luna’s got ton times his guts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry crossed to the window of the far sid of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering rybbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other than they had been since Bill and Fleur’s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger. Xenophilius’s attitude proved that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress. Two object that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out form the sides. A tiny pair of gliterring blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looking at this,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fetching,” said Ron. “Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased in Welling-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a>348</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">ton boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the tray into Hermione’s arms and joining Harry at the statue’s side. “Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw. ’Wit beyond measure is a man’s greatest treasure!’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He indicated the objects like ear trumpets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These are the Wrackspurt siphons—to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker’s immediate area. Here,” he pointed out the tina wings, “a billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally,” he pointed to the orange radish. “the Dirgible Plum, so as th enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said Xenophilius. “We make it ourselves.” As he started to pour out the drink, which was a deep purple as beetroot juice, he added, “Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, “how may I help you, Mr. Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly. “it’s about that symbol you were wearing around you neck at Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">HarryturnedtolookatRonandHermione.Neitherofthemseemed to have understood what Xenophilius had said either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Deathly Hallows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” said Xenophilius. “You haven’t heard of them? I’m not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron, “who attacked me for sport-ing the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows—at least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I still don’t really understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: The stuff was quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor beans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius, smack-349</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>350</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">ing his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what are the Deathly Hallows?” asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I assume that you are all familiar with the “Tale of the Three Brothers’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione said, “Yes.” Xenophilius nodded gravely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I’ve got it right here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The original?” inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, “Well then, why don’t you read it out loud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er. . . all right,” said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed one top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight—”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, I just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. “Go on, Hermione.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘And Death spoke to them—”’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p351"></a>351</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,” interjected Harry, “but Death spoke to them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a fairy tale, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right, sorry. Go on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the older brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak?” Harry interrupted again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So he can sneak up on people,” said Ron. “Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry Hermione.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Then Death stood aside and allowed thee three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they ahd had, and admiring Death’s gifts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a>352</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘That very night, another wizard crept upon the older brother as he lay wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother’s throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘And so Death took the first brother for his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and he turned it thrice i his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘And so Death took the second brother for his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, “Well, there you are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those are the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the</p>

<p class="calibre1">parchment. “The resurrection Stone,” he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. “The Cloak of Invisibility,” he finished, enclosing both the line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. “Together,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he said, “the Deathly Hallows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows‘ in the story,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. “That is a children’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already the sun was low int he sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When you say ‘mast of Death’—” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. “Conqueror. Vanquisher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whichever term you prefer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then . . . do you mean . . . ” said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, “that you believe these objects—these Hallows—actually exist?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius. “You are, I gather, no unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow, Close-minded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shock with the strain of not laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again, “We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, but the Third Hallows is true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p354"></a>354</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">or carrying a Bedazzling Hex or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,” said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. “None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the cloak existed . . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What of it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, how can that be real?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prove that it is not,” said Xenophilius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked outraged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that’s—I’m sorry, but that’s completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn’t exist? Do you expect me to get hold of—of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim that anything’s real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t exist!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, you could,” said Xenophilius. “I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So the Elder Wand,” said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, “you think that exists too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophilius. “The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p355"></a>355</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elder Wand is the Hallo that s most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which is what?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly a master of it,” said Xenophilius. “Surely you have heard of the way the wad came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. “Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a pause. Finally, Hermione asked stiffly, “Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry’s memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell . . . he had heard that name before. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But have you been misleading me, young woman!” said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. “I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything—everything!—to do with the Hallows!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“@Who are the Peverellls?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow,“</p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. “Ignorus Peverell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly!” said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. “The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus’s grave is conclusive proof!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a>356</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of what?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You will stay for dinner?” he called, as he vanished downstairs again. “Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,” said Ron under his breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you think?” he asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be the what the sign really means. This must be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick up fights, don’t go messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you’ll be okay.’ Come to think of it,” Ron added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you talking about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry Muggles.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">’Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.’ ‘Wand of elder, never prosper.’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry and I were raised by Muggles,” Hermione reminded him. “We were taught different superstitions.” She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p357"></a>357</p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius was that it seemed to make her forget that she was annoyed with Ron. “I think you’re right,” she told him. “It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, “the Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told Hermione, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And it’s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn’t noticed!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only if you shouted about it,” argued Ron. “Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, ‘I’ve got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you think you’re good enough.’ As you as you kept your trap shut—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?” said Hermione, looking skeptical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There have?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but—oh, it’s all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how do you know,” said Harry, “that those wands—the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny—aren’t the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a>358</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. And if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So why would you take the stone?” Ron asked him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius. . . Mad-Eye. . . Dumbledore. . . my parents. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t want to come back, would they?” said Harry, thinking about the tale they had just heard. “I don’t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?” he asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” she replied sadly. “I don’t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kit themselves that’s possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorceror’s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was something like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. “Don’t you realize he’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s. It’s infallible. We’ve never been spotted under it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course not—we’re invisible when we’re under it, Ron!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But all the stuff he said about the other cloaks, and they’re not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It’s never occurred to me before, but I’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes in them. Harry’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly new, is it, but it’s just. . . perfect!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they argued in whispered, Harry moved around the room, only half lis-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a>359</p>
<p class="calibre1">tening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment’s bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, what are you doing? I don’t think you should look around when he’s not here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry had already reached the next level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends . . . friends . . . friends. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window, across a bloodred sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry. “Where’s Luna?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Luna?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius halted on the top step. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a>360</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I’ve already told you. She is down at Bortons Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So why have you only laid that tray for four?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius’s hands shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think Luna’s been here for weeks,” said Harry. “Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn’t been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the window?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their wands. Xenophilius frowned, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, look at this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He strode to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE and captioned with the reward money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. “Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius licked his lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They took my Luna,” he whispered. “Because of what I’ve been writing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They took my Luna and I don’t know where she is, what they’ve done to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they might give her back to me if I—if I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hand over Harry?” Hermione finished for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No deal,” said Ron flatly. “Get out of the way, we’re leaving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his laps drawn back into a dreadful leer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p361"></a>361</p>
<p class="calibre1">“They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You must not leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t make us hurt you,” Harry said. “Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HARRY!” Hermione screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm’s way as Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew to all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the door, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms above his head. He heard Hermione’s scream, Ron’s yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half burried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half o the ceiling had fallen in, and the end of Luna’s bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another whit shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger to her lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">the door downstairs crashed open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers? said a rough voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. . . no . . . upstairs. . . Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren’t coming back for anything less</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a>362</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 21. THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">than some solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before”—</p>
<p class="calibre1">another bang, another squeal—“when you thought we’d give her back if you offered us proof there are Crumple”—bang—“Headed”—bang—“Snorkacks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—no—I beg you!” sobbed Xenophilius. “It really is Potter! Really!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!” roared the Death Eater, and there are a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This place looks like it’s about to fall in, Selwyn,” said a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase. “The stairs are completely blocked. Could trying clearing it? Might bring the place down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You lying piece of filth,” shouted the wizard named Selwyn. “you’ve never seen Potter in your life, have you? thought you’d lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you’ll get your girl back like this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I swear. . . I swear. . . Potter’s upstairs!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Homenum revelio,” said the voice at the foot of the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Potter, I tell you ,it’s Potter!” sobbed Xenophilius. “Please. . . please. . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can have your little girl, Lovegood,” said Selwyn, “if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. but if this is a plot, if it’s a trick, if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get though the debris on the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stated to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius’s banging and scrap-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p363"></a>363</p>
<p class="calibre1">ing drew nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. “Do you trust me, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay then,” Hermione whispered, “give me the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you’re going to put it on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me? But Harry—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my shoulder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold tight,” she whispered. “Hold tight. . . any second. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius’s paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Obliviate!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand first into his face, and then at the floor beneath them. “Deprimo!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry’s ears as she dragged him once more into darkness. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“That treacherous old bleeder.” Ron panted, emerging from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. “Hermione you’re a genius, a total genius. I can’t believe we got out of that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cave Inimicum. . . Didn’t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn’t I tell him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now his house has been blown apart!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Serves him right,” said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, “What’d you reckon they’ll do to him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione, “That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why hide me though?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit, Ron! They’ve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you’re with him?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, you are, Hermione,” agreed Harry fervently. “I don’t know what we’d do without you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She beamed, but became solemn at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about Luna?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still Alive—“ began Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. “She must be alive, she must!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron. “Whether she survives the place, though. . . Loads don’t. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She will,” said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope you’re right,” said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. “I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a few minutes’ silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows. . . such rubbish. . . although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, “he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p367"></a>367</p>
<p class="calibre1">of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione. “Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on, though,” said Ron. “The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said Ron. “Harry’s Invisibility Cloak—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said Hermione firmly. “A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,” said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no such thing, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You said there have been loads of wands—the Deathstick and whatever they were called—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?” Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad appear. . . and Cedric. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those kind of—of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s expres-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p368"></a>368</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 22. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS</p>
<p class="calibre1">sion. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, “you don’t know anything about him, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. “I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ’Peverell’ is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,” she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. “It lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Extinct in the male line?” repeated Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It means the name died out,” said Hermione, “centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they’d just be called something different.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name “Peverell”: a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, “Marvolo Gaunt!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry said Ron and Hermione together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. “Could you see what it looked like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not really,” said Harry, trying to remember. “There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a>369</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey. . . You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not said Harry excitedly, “Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. . . and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously, “but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, why not? Why not? said Harry, abandoning caution. “It was a stone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support. “What if it was the Resurrection Stone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s mouth fell open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey—but would it still work if Dumbledore broke—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. Harry you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’d you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione’s. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death. . . Master. . . Conqueror. . . Vanquisher. . . The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Hor-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p370"></a>370</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 22. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS</p>
<p class="calibre1">cruxes were no match. . . Neither can live while the other survives. . . Was this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, with a gasp, he remembered—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow. . . ” Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s my ancestor. I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Read it,” he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand. “Read it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p371"></a>371</p>
<p class="calibre1">and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring—it’s in the Snitch!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you reckon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry. Everything fit, everything. . . His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then—</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s what he’s after.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry gazed into the darkness. . . . If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Didn’t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of three. . . . for the wand</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p372"></a>372</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 22. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose existence was best known. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is it?” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty, “This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I’ve got one—maybe two—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">He held up the Snitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t realize. . . he just thinks it’s a powerful wand—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But don’t you see? It all fits—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not, it doesn’t,” she said. “It doesn’t. Harry, you’re just getting carried away. Please,” she said as she started to speak, “please just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of Death—Harry, why wouldn’t he have told you? Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had his answer ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them for yourself! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a Quest!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">cried Hermione in exasperation. “I didn’t really believe it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took no notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p373"></a>373</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get sidetracked—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She appealed to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t believe in this, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked up, Ron hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno. . . I mean. . . bits of it sort of fit together,” said Ron awkwardly, “But when you look at the whole thing. . . ” He took a deep breath. “I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe. . . maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione. “I’ll take first watch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">I open at the close. . . . But what was the close? Why couldn’t he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person. . . and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort’s thoughts, because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing. . . Hermione would not like that idea, of course. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, she did not believe. . . .Xenophilius had been right, in a way. . . Limited, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p374"></a>374</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 22. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Narrow, Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection Stone. . . and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand. . . . He must try that in the morning. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">If only there was a way of getting a better wand. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once more. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione’s flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could extinguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joy-ful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. “We’re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p375"></a>375</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives. . . master of Death. . . Why didn’t Ron and Hermione understand? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,”’ Harry quoted calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?” Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort’s mind as well as before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three Horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “We need a plan of action, come on! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again. The orphanage. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p376"></a>376</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 22. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain. “Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a poke around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of Snatchers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,” said Ron. “The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“On what?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what’s going on! Nearly all of the programs are following You-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch, I really want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragonpox, and once a few bars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.” While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told them. “Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in the end. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ’Albus’! Get in here, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p377"></a>377</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool, eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee was saying, and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Evening, River.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘River”’ that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got code names, but you can usually tell—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on, “let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggleborn Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse—more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a>378</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 22. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we can return to regular contributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, River,” said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kingsley!” burst out Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,” said Kingsley. “However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be ’Wizards first’? asked Lee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d say that it’s one short step from ’Wizards first’ to ’Purebloods first,’ and then to ’Death Eaters,”’ replied Kingsley. “We’re all human, aren’t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this mess,” said Lee. “And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature ’Pals of Potter.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p379"></a>379</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione forestalled him in a whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We know it’s Lupin!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do,” said Lupin firmly. “There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. ’The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nearly always right,” she repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told me Lupin’s living with Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting pretty big too. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,” said Lupin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid”—all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence—“well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ’Support Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p380"></a>380</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 22. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ’Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fred!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—is it George?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not being ’Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be ’Rapier’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, all right then, ’Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the various stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners will know, unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p381"></a>381</p>
<p class="calibre1">basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the weight of tension leaving him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?” asked Lee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been putting in?” asked Fred. “Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re planning to take any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety first!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee. ”Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will be ’Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good, eh?” said Ron happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brilliant,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s so brave of them,” sighed Hermione admiringly. “If they were found</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. “Like us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p382"></a>382</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 22. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“HARRY, NO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—demort’s after the Elder Wand!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The name’s Taboo!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. “I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore—</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve got to put the protection back around us—quickly—it’s how they find—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice through the darkness. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p383"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 23</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">Malfoy Manor</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harrylookedaroundattheothertwo,nowmereoutlinesinthe darkness. He saw Hermione point her wand, set toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get up, vermin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground, before he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent: all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get—off—her!” Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, “No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if he’s on my list,” said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. “Delicious girl. . . what a treat 383</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p384"></a>384</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . I do enjoy the softness of the skin. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrir Greyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Search the tent!” said another voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was thrown face down onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been cast down beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice from overhead, and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam of wand light fell onto his face and Greyback laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not answer immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I said,” repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain. “what happened to you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stung.” Harry muttered. “Been Stung.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, looks like it.” said a second voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s your name?” snarled Greyback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dudley.” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And your first name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—Vernon. Vernon Dudley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Check the list, Scabior.” said Greyback, and Harry head him move sideways to look down at Ron, instead. “And what about you, ginger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stan Shunpike.” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like ’ell you are.” said the man called Scabior. “We know Stan Shunpike, </p>
<p class="calibre1">’e’s put a bit of work our way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was another thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bardy Weasley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you’re related to blood traitors even if</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p385"></a>385</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re not a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend . . . ” The relish in his voice made Harry’s flesh crawl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easy, Greyback.” said Scabior over the jeering of the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Penelope Clearwater.” said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s your blood status?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Half-Blood.” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easy enough to check,” said Scabior. “But the ’ole lot of ’em look like they could still be ’ogwarts age—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’b lebt,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Left, ’ave you, ginger?” said Scabior. “And you decided to go camping? And you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the Dark Lords name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nod a laugh,” said Ron. “Aggiden.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accident?” There was more jeering laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s name, Weasley?” growled Greyback, “The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We’ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him down into a sitting position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. Harry was still half blind, barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last the man tying then had walked away, Harry whispered to the other prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyone still got a wand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” Said Ron and Hermione from either side of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is all my fault. I said the name. I’m sorry—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p386"></a>386</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a new, but familiar voice. and it came from directly behind Harry, from the person tied to Hermione’s left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is you! If they find out who they’ve got—! They’re Snatchers, they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not a bad little haul for one night.” Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and these truants. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?” he roared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. There’s no Vernon Dudley un ’ere, Greyback.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interesting,” said Greyback. “That’s interesting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and sores in the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What house were you in at Hogwarts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slytherin,” said Harry automatically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that.” leered Scabior out of the shadows. “But none of ’em can tell us where the common room is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s in the dungeons.” said Harry clearly. “You enter through the wall. It’s full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake, so the light’s all green,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a short pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, well, looks like we really ’ave caught a little Slytherin.” said Scabior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good for you, Vernon, ’cause there ain’t a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who’s your father?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case. “Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p387"></a>387</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what, Greyback,” said Scabior. “I think there is a Dudley in there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, well.” said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry Official. Harry’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. “If you’re telling the truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let us—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at this. Greyback!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver to the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor’s sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ve–e–ery nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “We borrowed it to cut firewood—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across his dis-tended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding: Voldemort’s thoughts had suddenly become Razor-Sharp again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose . . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">So close . . . So close . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort’s thoughts, pulling himself back to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p388"></a>388</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior. “’ermione Granger,”’ Scabior was saying, “‘the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’arry Potter.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, nor to slip into Voldemort’s mind. He heard the creak of Greyback’s boots as he crouched down, in front of Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“you know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It isn’t! It isn’t me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . known to be traveling with Harry Potter,” repeated Greyback quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry’s scar was Exquisitely painful, but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of Voldemort’s thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had never been so important to remain in his own right mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, this changed things, doesn’t it?” whispered Greyback. Nobody spoke: Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione’s arm trembling against his. Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry’s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”Don’t touch it! Harry yelled; he could not stop himself, he thought he might be sick from the pain of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed Greyback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I found glasses!” yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is!” rasped Greyback. “We’ve caught Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, still fighting to remain present in his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say. Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress—</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p389"></a>389</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—Time to fly . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . To the Ministry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To hell with the Ministry.” growled Greyback. “They’ll take the credit, and we won’t get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you summon ’im? ’ere?” said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” snarled Greyback, “I haven’t got—they say he’s using the Malfoy’s place as a base. We’ll take the boy there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The werewolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort’s inner circle were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted this highest honor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s scar seared again—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the windows at the very top of the tower—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . completely sure it’s him? ’Cause if it ain’t, Greyback, we’re dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his moment of inade-quacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get the girl thrown in!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a man to enter. . . . A skeletal figure was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, or sleeping . . . ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right!” said Scabior. “All right, we’re in! And what about the rest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might as well take the lot. We’ve got two Mudbloods, that’s another ten Galleons. Give me the sword as well. If they’re rubies, that’s another small fortune right there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Hermione’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p390"></a>390</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing, fast and terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grab hold and make it tight. I’ll do Potter!” said Greyback, seizing a fistful of Harry’s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. “On three! One—two—three—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side; he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor inside the cell-like room—</p>
<p class="calibre1">The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another matter. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do we get in? They’re locked, Greyback, I can’t—blimey!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice. “State your purpose!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got Potter!” Greyback roared triumphantly. “We’ve captured Harry Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gates swung open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on!” said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by Greyback; now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a>391</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to-back to the four other prisoner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he knew yet that Harry was caught. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your journey was pointless. I never had it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You lie!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him, Harry’s scar threatened to burst with pain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Light spilled out over all of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is this?” said a woman’s cold voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” rasped Greyback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know me!” There was resentment in the werewolf ’s voice. “Fenrir Greyback! We’ve caught Harry Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know ’es swollen, ma’am, but it’s ’im!” piped up Scabior. “If you look a bit closer, you’ll see ’is scar. And this ’ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im, ma’am. There’s no doubt it’s ’im, and we’ve got ’is wand as well! ’Ere, ma’am—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring them in,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a>392</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. “My son, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry’s ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out Voldemort’s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They say they’ve got Potter,” said Narcissa’s cold voice. “Draco, come here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, boy?” rasped the werewolf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an in-tricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld Place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione’s jinx. His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. “Is it? Is it Harry Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t—I can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a>393</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Greyback menacingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry himself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback. “How did he get into this state?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That wasn’t us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” said Lucius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s something there,” he whispered. “it could be the scar, stretched tight. . . .” Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Draco’s face up close now, right beside his father’s. They were extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, Draco’s expression was full of reluctance, even fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They say this is his”—she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p394"></a>394</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">so that the light fell on Hermione instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,” said Narcissa sharply. “Yes—yes, she was in Madam Malkin’s with Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I . . . maybe . . . yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron. “It’s them, Potter’s friends—Draco, look at him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his name—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. “It could be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Grander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius, “And beside her, we think, Potter! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Potter and his friends, caught at last!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved master—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “I shall summon him, Bella. Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my authority—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,” interjected Greyback, “but it’s us that caught Potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the gold—“</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a>395</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gold!” laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law, her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. “Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I seek only the honor of his—of—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could not see. Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“STOP!” shrieked Bellatrix, “Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of Harry’s limited line of vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that?” he heard her say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sword,” grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give it to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not yours, missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a bang and a flash of red light; Harry knew that the Snatcher had been Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you think you’re playing at, woman?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stupefy!” she screamed, ”Stupefy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were no match for her, even thought there were four of them against one of her: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where did you get this sword?” she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How dare you?” he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. “Release me, woman!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where did you find this sword?” she repeated, brandishing it in his face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p396"></a>396</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was in their tent,” rasped Greyback. “Release me, I say!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Draco, move this scum outside,” said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. “If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you dare speak to Draco like—“ said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious problem!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,” she muttered, more to herself than to the others. “The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself. . . . But if he finds out . . . I must . . . I must know. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned back to her sister again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is my house, Bella, you don’t give orders in my—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we’re in!” shrieked Bellatrix. She looked frightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply. “All except. . . . except for the Mudblood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” shouted Ron. “You can have me, keep me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix hit him across the face: the blow echoed around the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next,” she said. “Blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more to them—yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p397"></a>397</p>
<p class="calibre1">She threw Greyback’s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s finished with her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. “I’d say I’ll get a bite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible, drawn out scream from directly above them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HERMIONE!” Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that Harry staggered. “HERMIONE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be quiet!” Harry said. “Shut up. Ron, we need to work out a way—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“HERMIONE! HERMIONE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need a plan, stop yelling—we need to get these ropes off—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” came a whisper through the darkness. “Ron? Is that you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow moving closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry? Ron?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luna?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it’s me! Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, I expect so. . . . There’s an old nail we use if we need to break anything. . . . Just a moment . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, “HERMIONE! </p>
<p class="calibre1">HERMIONE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p398"></a>398</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying. “Mr. Ollivander, have you got the nail? If you just move over a little bit . . . I think it was beside the water jug.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was back within seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll need to stay still,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could feel her digging at the rope’s tough fibers to work the knots free. From upstairs they heard Bellatrix’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We found it—we found it—PLEASE!” Hermione screamed again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry’s wrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, please stay still!” Luna whispered. “I can’t see what I’m doing—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My pocket!” said Ron, “In my pocket, there’s a Deluminator, and it’s full of light!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar: Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ron,” said Luna, and she began hacking at their bindings again. “Hello, Dean!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From above came Bellatrix’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another terrible scream—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“HERMIONE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What else did you take? What else have you got? Tel me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p399"></a>399</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trap-door. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, said “Thanks” to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto the cellar floor, looking groggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. “The cellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like physical pain. Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore’s Snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know what—nothing happened—</p>
<p class="calibre1">he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless—the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “We’re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eye blinked and was gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream. “Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p400"></a>400</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We only met him tonight!” Hermione sobbed. “We’ve never been inside your vault. . . . It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just a copy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A copy?” screeched Bellatrix. “Oh, a likely story!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we can find out easily!” came Lucius’s voice. “Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you must tell them that sword’s a fake, they mustn’t know it’s the real one, Griphook, please—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">He could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps; next moment, Draco’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don’t try anything, or I’ll kill you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar’s darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door flew open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“DOB—!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dobby’s enormous, tennis—ball shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how did you—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p401"></a>401</p>
<p class="calibre1">An awful scream drowned Harry’s words: Hermione was being tortured again. He cut to the essentials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can Disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you can take humans with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dobby nodded again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take them—take them to—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bill and Fleur’s,” said Ron. “Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf nodded for a third time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then come back,” said Harry. “Can you do that, Dobby?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, Harry Potter,” whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr. Ollivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, we want to help you!” Luna whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t leave you here,” said Dean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go, both of you! We’ll see you at Bill and Fleur’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kill me, then. Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what you seek. . . . There is so much you do not understand. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt Voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go!” Harry beseeched to Luna and Dean. “Go! We’ll follow, just go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They caught hold of the elf ’s outstretched fingers. There was another loud crack, and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was that?” shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. “Did you hear that? What was that noise in the cellar?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron stared at each other. </p>
