<p class="calibre1">“Draco—no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to Ron. They had no choice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. “Leave the lights on,” Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice. “Stand away from the door. I’m coming in.” The door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtail’s wand arm and forced it upwards. Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. Silently they struggled: Wormtail’s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry’s throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing!” Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail’s wheezy voice. “All fine!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could barely breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. “After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail’s mouth. He saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And we’ll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail’s wand from his other hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p403"></a>403</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Harry’s face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving inex-orably toward his own throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail’s throat, but it was no use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pettigrew was turning blue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Relashio!” said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Wormtail’s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor’s sword in his long-fingered hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix’s feet. She was barely stirring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook. “Is it the true sword?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Griphook. “It is a fake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you sure?” panted Bellatrix. “Quite sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the goblin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,” she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblin’s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. “And now,” she said in a voice that burst with triumph, “we</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p404"></a>404</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">call the Dark Lord!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At once, Harry’s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true surroundings vanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt—he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kill me, then!” demanded the old man. “You will not win, you cannot win! </p>
<p class="calibre1">That wand will never, ever be yours—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">And Voldemort’s fury broke: A burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window, his wrath barely controllable. . . . They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I think,” said Bellatrix’s voice, “we can dispose of the Mudblood. Greyback, take her if you want her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NOOOOOOOOOOOO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she turned her wand to face Ron instead—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Expelliarmus!” he roared, pointing Wormtail’s wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco and Greyback wheeled about; Harry yelled, “Stupefy!” and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light flew from Draco’s, Narcissa’s, and Greyback’s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“STOP OR SHE DIES! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione’s throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drop your wands,” she whispered. “Drop them, or we’ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p405"></a>405</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail’s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione’s throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto the floor at his feet, Ron did the same with Wormtail’s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good!” she leered. “Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,” said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions; Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!” The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p406"></a>406</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 23. MALFOY MANOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">directed her wand at the doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby!” she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. “You! You dropped the chandelier—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You must not hurt Harry Potter,” he squeaked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kill him, Cissy!” shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa’s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You dirty little monkey!” bawled Bellatrix. “How dare you take a witch’s wand, how dare you defy your masters?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, seconds before Voldemort was with them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, catch—and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby’s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron’s hair, and a blue of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill and Fleur’s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur’s . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of Gryffindor’s sword bumping against his back: Dobby’s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with them. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p407"></a>407</p>
<p class="calibre1">relinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys’, ready to fight if he needed to. “Have we come to the right place? Dobby?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“DOBBY!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf ’s heaving chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby—no—HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. “HELP!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his own arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf ’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry . . . Potter . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Itwaslikesinkingintoanoldnightmare;foraninstantHarryknelt again beside Dumbledore’s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife. Harry’s voice was still saying, “Dobby. . . Dobby. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. “Hermione,” he said suddenly. “Where is she?” “Ron’s taken her inside,” said Bill. “She’ll be all right.” Harry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf ’s body, then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making decisions, Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was really knowing what he was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at the Malfoy Manor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His rage was dreadful and yet Harry’s grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it, 409</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p410"></a>410</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to do it properly,” were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. “Not by magic. Have you got a spade?” And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out. . . though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys’ returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows. . . Horcruxes. . . Hallows. . . Horcruxes. . . yet no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy. . . Dumbledore had foreseen that. . . How much more had he known? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean. “How’s Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p411"></a>411</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better,” said Ron. “Fleur’s looking after her.” Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elf ’s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby’s head, muffling his batlike ears. “We should close his eyes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur’s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf ’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. “There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole. “I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “yeah. . . thanks Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p412"></a>412</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">swallowed. “Good bye Dobby,” he said It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. “D’ya mind if I stay here a moment?” He asked the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read: HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she’s safe too.” He looked around and saw Harry standing there. “I’ve been getting them all out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p413"></a>413</p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrow,” he explained. “Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the family—don’t apologize,” he added at the sight of Harry’s expression. “It was always a matter of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood traitor family there is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are they protected?” asked Harry. “Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that’s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There isn’t much room here, but she’s got plenty. Griphook’s legs are on the mend. Fleur’s given him Skele-Gro—we could probably move them in an hour or—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” Harry said and Bill looked startled. “I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It’s important.” He heard the authority of his own voice, the conviction, the voice of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby’s grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of their faces were turned toward him looking puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to wash,” Harry told Bill looking down at his hands still covered with mud and Dobby’s blood. “Then I’ll need to see them, straight away.” He walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p414"></a>414</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">one thing, his brain quite another. The Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You gave Ron the Deluminator. . . You understood him. . . . You gave him a way back. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And you understood Wormtail too. . . . You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And if you knew them. . . What did you know about me, Dumbledore? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Am I meant to know but not to seek? Did you know how hard I’d feel that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is that why you made it this difficult? So I’d have time to work that out? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold ray of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and then flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,” Harry said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Fleur. “You will ’ave to wait, ’Arry. Zey are both too tired—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry,” he said without heat, “but it can’t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately—and separately. It’s urgent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, what the hell’s going on?” asked Bill. “You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she’s been tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell me anything—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said Harry flatly. “You’re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We’re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally, Bill said, “All right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who do you want to talk to first?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p415"></a>415</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Griphook,” Harry said. “I’ll speak to Griphook first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up here, then,” said Bill, leading the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are you?” Harry asked Hermione. “You were amazing—coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll see. Come on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. Three doors led off it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room, it too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry. “How are your legs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Painful,” replied the goblin. “But mending.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin’s sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: His long feet were dirty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was larger than a house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You probably don’t remember—” Harry began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p416"></a>416</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever visited Gringotts?” said Griphook. “I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry’s scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request, the goblin broke the silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You buried the elf,” he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. “I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You dug the grave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not. He gathered himself for the attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Griphook, I need to ask—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You also rescued a goblin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You brought me here. Saved me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little impatiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very odd wizard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry. “Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had not meant to say it so badly: the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p417"></a>417</p>
<p class="calibre1">He closed his mind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry—” said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Break into a Gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed. “It is impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him. “It’s been done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The vault in question was empty at the time,” snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that even though Griphook had let Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached. “Its protection was minimal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and I’m guessing its protection will be pretty powerful,” said Harry. “It belongs to the Lestranges.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly. “No chance at all. If you seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thief, you have been warned, beware—yeah, I know, I remember,” said Harry. “But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure, I’m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,” said Griphook finally, “it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wand-carriers,” repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long been contested</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p418"></a>418</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">between wizards and goblins.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wandlore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said Ron. “You won’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s rising color. “This isn’t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Griphook gave a nasty laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We do!” said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. “We protest! And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I’m a Mudblood!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t call yourself—” Ron muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why shouldn’t I?” said Hermione. “Mudblood, and proud of it! I’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?” she asked. “Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione’s chair.) “You can’t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had shown Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you seek within the Lestranges’ vault?” he asked abruptly. “The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.” He looked from one to the other of them. “I think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p419"></a>419</p>
<p class="calibre1">you back there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps you’ve seen other things in there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So young,” he said finally, “to be fighting so many.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you help us?” said Harry. “We haven’t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin’s help. You’re our one chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall . . . think about it,” said Griphook maddeningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But—” Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur’s bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, of course,” said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Little git,” whispered Ron. “He’s enjoying keeping us hanging.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, “are you saying what I think you’re saying? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in the Lestranges vault?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. “Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d been in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p420"></a>420</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we’d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who’s been, places he’s done something important?” said Ron, looking baffled. “Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” said Harry. “He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think he’d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And don’t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said it night he came back, I heard him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry rubbed his scar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think he’d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me. . . except for Hogwarts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You really understand him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bits of him,” said Harry. “Bits . . . I just wish I’d understood Dumbledore as much. But we’ll see. Come on—Ollivander now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur’s. A weak “Come in!” answered them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p421"></a>421</p>
<p class="calibre1">on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear boy,” Ollivander’s voice was feeble. “You rescued us, I thought we would die in that place, I can never thank you . . . never thank you . . . enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were glad to do it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic . . . yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything. Anything.” Said the wandmaker weakly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you mend this? Is it possible?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves in his palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holly and phoenix feather,” said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. “Eleven inches. Nice and supple.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. “Can you—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” whispered Ollivander. “I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p422"></a>422</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you identify these?” Harry asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walnut and dragon heartstring,” he said. “Twelve-and-three-quarter inches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And this one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander performed the same examination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps not. If you took it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—I did—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said Harry, “like they can think for themselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them, though?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry. “Can I use it safely?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p423"></a>423</p>
<p class="calibre1">will usually bend its will to its new master.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling Wormtail’s wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry’s face. “You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a wand?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander swallowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are legends, though,” said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea into action. “Legends about a wand—or wands—that have been passed from hand to hand by murder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only one wand, I think,” he whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn’t he?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. “How do you know this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander looked terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I-I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand,” said Harry. “You told him about the twin cores? You said he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p424"></a>424</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it didn’t work,” Harry went on. “Mine still beat the borrowed wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you know why that is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would have snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that other wand, didn’t he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you know this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, he asked,” whispered Ollivander. “He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Dark Lord,” said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, “had always been happy with the wand I made him—yes and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches—until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken beyond repair,” said Harry quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Hermione, sounding frightened. “He can’t know that, Harry, how could he—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Priori Incantatem,” said Harry. “We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys’, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells they’ve cast lately, they’d see that yours broke mine, they’ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they’ll realize that I’ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p425"></a>425</p>
<p class="calibre1">The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about that now—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Mr. Ollivander intervened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And will it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,” said Ollivander, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . formidable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure, when they first met, of how much he like Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?” asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Ollivander. “Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand’s course through history. There are gaps, of, course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authen-ticity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you—you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?” Hermione asked hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Ollivander. “Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p426"></a>426</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Ollivander,” said Harry, “you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how—how do you—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north. “You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was a rumor,” whispered Ollivander. “A rumor, years and years ago, long before you were born I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business; that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I can see that,” said Harry. He stood up. “Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we’ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The—the what?” asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Deathly Hallows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know about the Hallows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said Harry. “Thank you very much. We’ll leave you to get some rest now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander looked stricken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was torturing me!” he gasped. “The Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no idea. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do,” said Harry, “I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p427"></a>427</p>
<p class="calibre1">he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory was right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,” he said, “I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindelwald. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know—but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can’t have been that difficult.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron. “But then—where is it now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At Hogwarts,” said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently. “Harry, let’s go and get it before he does!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s too late for that,” said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. “He knows where it is. He’s there now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” Ron said furiously. “How long have you known this—why have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone—we could still go—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. “Hermione’s right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p428"></a>428</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 24. THE WANDMAKER</p>
<p class="calibre1">me to get the Horcruxes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not supposed to . . . I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his high, cold voice. “Leave me now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape’s figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How fitting that this would be its last great act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long as thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose: He felt amused derision. Dumbledore’s hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried with him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledore’s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p429"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 25</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">Shell Cottage</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">BillandFleur’scottagestoodaloneonacliffoverlookingthesea,its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?” “What if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy’ to get the Hallows?” “Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">429</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p430"></a>430</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 25. SHELL COTTAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">The odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him feel just as confused as Ron’s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You could never have done that, Harry,” she said again and again. “You couldn’t have broken into Dumbledore’s grave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore’s intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, he is. Ron, please don’t start that again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at the horizon. “The solve doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don’t you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I could have,” said Harry without looking at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you don’t thing you did, do you?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I don’t,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There you go!” said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. “If it wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t—but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?” “I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said Harry. There was little</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p431"></a>431</p>
<p class="calibre1">about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. “He would have gone on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean, ’gone on’?” asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, “’Arry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you. ’E eez in ze smallest bedroom, </p>
<p class="calibre1">’e says ’e does not want to be over’eard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage’s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,” said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s great!” said Harry, relief surging through him. “Griphook, thank you, we’re really—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—in return,” said the goblin firmly, “for payment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How much do you want? I’ve got gold.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not gold,” said Griphook. “I have gold.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s spirits plummeted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can’t have that,” he said. “I’m sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,” said the goblin softly, “we have a problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. “I’ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p432"></a>432</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 25. SHELL COTTAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The sword’s ours—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“it is not,” said the goblin. “We’re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor’s—</p>
<p class="calibre1">” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And before it was Gryffindor’s, whose was it?” demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one’s,” said Ron. “It was made for him, wasn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. “Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First’s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblin-work! It belongs with the goblins. The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, “We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that’s all right. Could you give us a few minutes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin nodded, looking sour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, “He’s having a laugh. We can’t let him have that sword.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is true?” Harry asked Hermione. “Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there’s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said Ron, “about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron.” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve been treated brutally in the past.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve killed plenty of us. They’ve fought dirty too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p433"></a>433</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us, is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked out of the window at Dobby’s grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, “how’s this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it. There’s a fake in these, isn’t there? We switch them, and give him the fake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would!” said Hermione. “He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,” she said quietly, “is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards, Ron?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s ears had turned red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What’s your solution, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brilliant, I’ll go and get one of our ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe he’s lying,” Harry said, opening his eyes again. “Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn’t take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history’s right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p434"></a>434</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 25. SHELL COTTAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does it make a difference?” asked Hermione. “Changes how I feel about it,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took a deep breath. ’</p>
<p class="calibre1">’We’ll tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped us get into that vault—but we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A grin spread slowly across Ron’s face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, we can’t—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He can have it,” Harry went on, “after we’ve used it on all of the Horcruxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll make sure he gets it then. I’ll keep my word.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that could be years!” said Hermione. “I know that, but he needn’t. I won’t be lying. . . really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: FOR THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">GREATER GOOD. He pushed the idea away. What choice did they have? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t like it,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nor do I, much,” Harry admitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I think it’s genius,” said Ron, standing up again. “Let’s go and tell him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, “So. We begin!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They set-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p435"></a>435</p>
<p class="calibre1">tled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook’s preference, in semidarkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once,” Griphook told them, “on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s really only enough left for one of us,” said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for meal-times. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges’ vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They needed Griphook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still—frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p436"></a>436</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 25. SHELL COTTAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley could no longer work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry,” he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. “I never meant you to have to deal with all of this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Arry, you saved my sister’s life, I do not forget.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,” Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, “Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel’s zis evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,” she scowled a little at the mention of him, “can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean can take zat room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. “Don’t worry about us.” And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We won’t need to be here much longer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, what do you mean?” she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. “Of course you must not leave, you are safe ’ere!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . and tiny little ears,” Luna was saying, “a bit like hippo’s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p437"></a>437</p>
<p class="calibre1">laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance to escape Fleur’s questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,” Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luna, we told you,” Hermione called over to her. “That horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,” said Luna serenely, “Daddy told me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It will probably have re–formed by now, they mend themselves, you know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,” said Luna, approaching the old man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I you, my dear,” said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. “You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,” said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. “And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill’s Auntie Muriel!? I never returned ’er tiara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will be an honor,” said Ollivander with a little bow, “the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moonstones and diamonds,” said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry noticing. “Made by goblins, I think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And paid for by wizards,” said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p438"></a>438</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 25. SHELL COTTAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">set off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything’s fine,” he told Fleur. “Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love, Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they’re still operating an Owl-Order business out of her back room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought we’d stolen it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, she eez charmante, your aunt,” said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy’s made a tiara,” piped up Luna, “Well, more of a crown, really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron caught Harry’s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, he’s trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he’s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a bang on the front door. Everyone’s head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who is it?” Bill called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is I, Remus John Lupin!” called a voice over the howling wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? “I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lupin,” muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p439"></a>439</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried aloud, “It’s a boy! We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione shrieked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wha—? Tonks—Tonks has had the baby?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin. All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, “Congratulations!” and Ron said, “Blimey, a baby!” as if he had never heard of such a thing before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes—yes—a boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry. “M-me?” stammered Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You, yes, of course—Dora quite agrees, no one better—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—yeah—blimey—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. “Thank you, thank you, Bill” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To Teddy Remus Lupin,” said Lupin, “a great wizard in the making!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Oo does ’e look like?” Fleur inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it’s turned ginger in the hour since. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day that she was born.” He drained his goblet. “Oh, go on then, just one more,” he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p440"></a>440</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 25. SHELL COTTAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin’s news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. . . no. . . I really must get back,” said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good-bye, good-bye—I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few day’s time—</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you—” He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Godfather, Harry!” said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table. “A real honor! Congratulations!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin’s absence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends—or, at least, goblins I know well, and like.” Again, Bill hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p441"></a>441</p>
<p class="calibre1">more empty goblets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,” Bill told her, “Just a moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She backed out and he closed the door again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are talking about a different breed of being,” said Bill. “Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries—but you’ll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I respect—” Harry began, but Bill shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it was bought—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook’s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p442"></a>442</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 25. SHELL COTTAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">than he was letting on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. Thanks. I’ll bear that in mind.” As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Theirplansweremade,theirpreparationscomplete;inthesmallest bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from the sweater Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said Harry, nodding toward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hate that thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn’t work properly for me . . . It’s like a bit of her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could not help but remember how Hermione has dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however, the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll probably help you get in character, though,” said Ron. “think what that wand’s done!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that’s my point!” said Hermione. “This is the wand that tortured Neville’s mum and dad, and who knows how many other people? This is the 443</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p444"></a>444</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">wand that killed Sirius!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor’s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione’s had done. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione’s problem was: She had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once. He could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said, “We’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We’ve told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and we’ve told them not to get up to see us off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform in Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkin’s old tent on the night that the Snatcher’s caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p445"></a>445</p>
<p class="calibre1">to escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor’s sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother lessons,” growled Ron, as the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill’s warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it: Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than “We’ll just have to wing it, mate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry slept badly that night. Lying away in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt uneasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby’s grave now, in a year’s time the mound would be covered in flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p446"></a>446</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The white stone that bore the elf ’s name had already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, thorough which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door opening made him look around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix’s low voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you . . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking handsome” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did last time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of Ron’s appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was just not possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought because he knew him so well. Ron’s hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p447"></a>447</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavy eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry. “Shall we go, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Chard stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked on front of Harry’s throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s feet. “I can’t see a thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Ton, the stooped and toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione paused he inclined his head subserviently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of the Inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, okay!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p448"></a>448</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly and shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before his first team at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moaning to the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">they</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My children,” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched, he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, you know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I really—” stammered Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passerby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p449"></a>449</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, Madam Lestrange!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry’s neck: A tall, think wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as much contempt as she could muster:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what do you want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s another Death Eater!” breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into Hermione’s ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my presence is not welcome . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry recognized his voice now: Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her mistake. “How are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? Why?” asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house, after the . . . ah . . . escape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,” said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix’s most contemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did it offend you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said Hermione coolly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said Travers. “While they do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p450"></a>450</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the Ministry last week. ‘I’m a witch, sir, I’m a witch, let me prove it to you!”’ he said in a squeaky impersonation. “As if I was going to give her my wand—but whose wand,” said Travers curiously, “are you using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have my wand here,” said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix’s wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know what rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is Dragomir Despard,” said Hermione; they had decided that a fic-tional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume. “He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord’s aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron’s hand as though frightened of dirtying himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So what brings you and your—ah—sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?” asked Travers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alas, I also,” said Travers. “Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt Griphook’s clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers matching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p451"></a>451</p>
<p class="calibre1">there was no means for Harry to communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Probity Probes,” signed Travers theatrically, “so crude—but so effective!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, “Confundo” twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’ve just done that!” said Hermione in Bellatrix’s commanding, arrogant voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione swept forward. Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold. The wizards were both scratching their heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed, and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p452"></a>452</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal . . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leprechaun,” and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione stepped forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently startled. “Dear me!” How-how may I help you today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wish to enter my vault,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was Travers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have . . . identification?” asked the goblin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Identification? I-I have never been asked for identification before!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They know!” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “They must have been warned there might be an imposter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your wand will do, madam,” said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix’s wand had been stolen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “the Imperious Curse!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, “Imperio!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix’s wand, ex-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p453"></a>453</p>
<p class="calibre1">amined it closely, and then said, “Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Hermione, “No, no, that’s mine—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were watching. “But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imperio!” once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix’s wand, “yes, very handsome. and is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. “Good, good! S, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight. “I shall take you to your vault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait—Bogrod!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have instructions,” he said with a bow to Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forgive me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p454"></a>454</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . . Very old family . . . old clients . . . This way, please . . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. Harry looked back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders: neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,” he added, in response to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. “I don’t think I did it strongly enough, I don’t know . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: “You need to mean them, Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do we do?” asked Ron. “Shall we get out now, while we can?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If we can,” said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which who knew what was happening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got this far, I say we go on,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good!” said Griphook. “So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no long have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pointed his wand at Travers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imperio!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you making him do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front of Griphook, Harry, Ron, and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p455"></a>455</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione crammed together in the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurried past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were a deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking. They zoomed through it. Water filled Harry’s eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C-Cushioning Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Thief ’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. “It washes away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposers in Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilder-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p456"></a>456</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">ment: The Thief ’s Downfall seemed to have lifted his Imperius Curse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need him,” said Griphook, “we cannot enter the vault without a Gringott’s goblin. And we need the clankers!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imperio!” Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego!” They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way, Griphook!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry. He was trying to listen: He thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Griphook, how much farther?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not far, Harry Potter, not far. . . “</p>
<p class="calibre1">And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast’s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground, its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is partially blind,” panted Griphook, “but even more savage for that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, we have the means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p457"></a>457</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “It will expect pain when it hears the noise. It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the den. The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guess that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures—some with long spines, other with drooping wings-potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. “Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had described Hufflepuff ’s cap to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise. “Light your wands, can’t you? And hurry, we have little time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lumos!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too, and were now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p458"></a>458</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">examining the piles of objects surrounding them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, could this be—? Aargh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They have added Germino and Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s small and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles—otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s there, it’s up there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione pointed there wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Huf-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p459"></a>459</p>
<p class="calibre1">flepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accio Cup!” cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the goblin. “If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than—wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione fumbled insider her robes, drew out a beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I can just poke the sword through a handle—but how am I going to get up there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry’s face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were truly trapped now: There was no way out except through the door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, “I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, “Levicorpus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain, Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p460"></a>460</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">treasure, they struggled and yelled has Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff ’s cup, hooking it onto the blade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Impervius!” screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight; and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry seized Griphook’s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liberatocorpus!” yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry’s hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get it!” Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. “Where’s the sword? It had the cup on it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening—it was too late—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry’s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harry’s reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword’s blade was flung into the air. The goblin astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, Hermione into the outer chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p461"></a>461</p>
<p class="calibre1">and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry’s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, “Thieves! Thieves! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Help! Thieves!” He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stupefy!” he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins; The wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, “Relashio!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cuffs broken open with loud bangs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This way!” Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry—Harry—what are you doing?” cried Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get up, climb up, come on—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry’s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll never get out, it’s too big!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione screamed, but the dragon</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p462"></a>462</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 26. GRINGOTTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry’s eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crash of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, “Defodio!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon’s fire kept their progress clear—</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon’s brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p463"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 27</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Final Hiding Place</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Therewasnomeansofsteering;thedragoncouldnotseewhereit was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map, Harry’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast’s neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell. Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his seat prickling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges’ vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? </p>
<p class="calibre1">463</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p464"></a>464</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 27. THE FINAL HIDING PLACE</p>
<p class="calibre1">How quickly would they realize what had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air. It climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No idea,” Harry bellow back. His hands were numb with cold but he did not date attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed for open seal he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon’s back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“or are we losing height?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset. the landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called back to the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p465"></a>465</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NOW!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything; it was already fifty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did not seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They changes and then gulped down the juice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, “we got the Horcrux. On the downside—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p466"></a>466</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 27. THE FINAL HIDING PLACE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little scab. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hanging around our necks,” said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked, “Will it be alright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron, “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hiccuping herself back to seriousness. “He’ll know, won’t he? You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him!” said Ron hopefully, “Maybe they’ll cover up—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice were extinguished. Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. The one thing that he had dreaded—but it could not be true, he could not see how. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “Say it again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p467"></a>467</p>
<p class="calibre1">“M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, “m-my Lord. . . we t-tried to st-stop them. . . Im-impostors, my Lord. . . broke—broke into the—into the Lestranges’ vault. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">”Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing impostors? Who were they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was. . . it was. . . the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him, “Tell me! What did they take?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A. . . a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s. He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality—the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy—</p>
<p class="calibre1">But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p468"></a>468</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 27. THE FINAL HIDING PLACE</p>
<p class="calibre1">True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because he had no body to fell, being less than ghost. . . . No, surely, the rest were safe. . . The other Horcruxes must be intact. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he must know, he must be sure. . . He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts—</p>
<p class="calibre1">A modicum of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never been traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding places, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes. . . . A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease flickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name. . . . Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts. . . . Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would go first. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lake, surely impossible. . . though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Hogwarts. . . but he knew the his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. . . . . To tell Snape why the boy might return</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p469"></a>469</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy. Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He would not be parted from the snake anymore . . . and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort’s mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort’s high screams. “He knows and he’s going to check where the others are, and the last one,” he was already on his feet, “is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what did you see? How do you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I saw him find out about the cup, I-I was in his head, he’s”—Harry remembered the killings—“he’s seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others are safe, the ring first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He things the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in. I think he’ll check that one last, but he could still be there within hours—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scrambling to his feet too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think about exactly where it is—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p470"></a>470</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 27. THE FINAL HIDING PLACE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait, wait!” cried Hermione as Ron caught up to the Horcrux and Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. “We can’t just go, we haven’t got a plan, we need to—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now, ”Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t safe enough? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how are we going to get in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school’s like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we don’t really fit—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water. The dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two, Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p471"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 28</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Missing Mirror</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’sfeettouchedtheroad.HesawtheachinglyfamiliarHogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the hear, he remembered with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing—and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort’s when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry’s body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to run. Even attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accio Cloak!” roared one of the Death Eaters Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The Summoning 471</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p472"></a>472</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 28. THE MISSING MIRROR</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charm had not worked on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows. “Spread now. He’s here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters’ searching wands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We know you are here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll find you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set up that spell to tell them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let’em have free rein, they’d find him quick enough!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’an dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, nor his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors they would have to produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the pitch blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry’s flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p473"></a>473</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered “Expecto Patronum!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said: “Potter, in here, quick!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into the street and slammed the door behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog’s Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog’s Head’s barman, was the only person not wearing a hood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p474"></a>474</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 28. THE MISSING MIRROR</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So what? You send dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus back at’em! I’m not having’em near me, I’ve told you that. I’m not having it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That wasn’t your Patronus,” said a Death Eater. “That was a stag. It was Potter’s!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. “Stag! You idiot—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Expecto Patronum!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High Street, and out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not what I saw” said the Death Eater, though was less certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions told the barman. “Someone was out on the streets against regulations—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You set off the Caterwauling Charm?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks, and summoned him. He’s not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry about us.” said one of the Death Eaters, “worry about yourself, breaking curfew!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub’s closed down? What will happen to your little sidelines then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you threatening—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first Death Eater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death Eater. “Break curfew again and we won’t be so lenient!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p475"></a>475</p>
<p class="calibre1">could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror, propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barman entered the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you thinking, coming here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said Harry. “You can’t thank you enough. You saved our lives!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face: trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair beard. He wore spectacles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You sent Dobby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s dead,” said Harry, “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, “I’m sorry to hear it, I liked that elf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The silver doe,” he said excitedly, “Was that you too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you talking about?” asked Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p476"></a>476</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 28. THE MISSING MIRROR</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just prove my Patronus is a goat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Ron, “Yeah. . . well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was sound of chewing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right then,” said Aberforth when the had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. “We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off, they’ll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you’ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He’s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into Hogwarts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got to,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning forward, “is to get as far from here as from here as you can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to get into the castle. Dumbledore—I mean, your brother—wanted us—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth’s glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p477"></a>477</p>
<p class="calibre1">and his clever schemes. He’s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don’t owe him anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t understand.” said Harry again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, don’t I? said Aberforth quietly. ”You don’t think I understood my own brother? Think you know Albus better than I did?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “It’s. . . he left me a job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you’d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—it’s not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Got to’? Why ‘got to’? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said Aberforth roughly. “Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. “But you’re fighting too, you’re in the Order of the Phoenix—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give it to someone else!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wanted him with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips, Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Dumbledore” said Hermione rather timidly. ”Is that your sister? Ariana? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. “Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every office, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want o hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers’: The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said Hermione in a low voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he’d left ’em well alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never you mind,” said Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said Hermione. “Are you—are you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p479"></a>479</p>
<p class="calibre1">talking about your sister?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aberforth, ”and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d done it, because the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in St. Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it in any longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was her favourite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and wrangled beard. “Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with ‘the most notable magical names of the day,”’ Aberforth succored. “He didn’t want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p480"></a>480</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 28. THE MISSING MIRROR</p>
<p class="calibre1">was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then, when she was fourteen. . . See, I wasn’t there.” said Aberforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aberforth spat into the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he’d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both of ’em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told him, you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s in no fit state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it is you’re planning to go, when you’re making</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p481"></a>481</p>
<p class="calibre1">your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn’t like that.” said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. ”Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . Didn’t I understand, my poor sister wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother’s best friend—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn’t stand it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know what she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could have been any of us—and she was dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m so . . . I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was never free,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p482"></a>482</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 28. THE MISSING MIRROR</p>
<p class="calibre1">who wasn’t there. ’Don’t hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. “He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana . . . It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you wouldn’t say he was free.” </p>
