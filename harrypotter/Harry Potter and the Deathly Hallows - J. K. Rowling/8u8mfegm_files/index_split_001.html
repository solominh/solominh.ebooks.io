<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 6. THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’aev ’ad champagne.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table, where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. “Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are both fine with it the way it is!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time, young man—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron furiously. “No! </p>
<p class="calibre1">So why in the name of Merlin’s saggy left—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley firmly, “And do as you’re told.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can help, some of it’s my mess.” Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour, you know they’re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius’s bike, and, er, I’m hiding—that’s to say, keeping—it in here. Fantastic stuff! There’s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it’s called, the most magnificent battery, and it’ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I’m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly’s not—I mean, when I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>85</p>
<p class="calibre1">got time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m doing it, I’m doing—! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And how did you manage to get away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,” said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” Ron told Harry. “I reckon he might have survived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How can he be sure what he saw?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even if the Killing curse missed, Mad Eye still fell about a thousand feet,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He could have used a Shield Charm—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, looking shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being realistic!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time, Harry imagined Mad—Eye’s body, broken as Dumbledore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>86</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 6. THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why no one’s found him,” said Ron wisely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. “Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the over earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tergeo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sorry. . . . ” She blew her nose and hiccuped. “It’s just so awf-ful, isn’t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But you know what he’d say to us if he was here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’C-constant vigilance,”’ said Hermione, mopping her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” said Ron, nodding. “He’d tell us to learn from what happened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at Ron’s ankle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron’s leg and retied it shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing with all those books anyway?” Ron asked, limping</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>87</p>
<p class="calibre1">back to his bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione. “When we’re looking for the Horcruxes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I forgot we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary. “I wonder</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think we’d better take it, to be safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with me,” Harry began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You know, I think I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if we’re not going back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!” said Harry again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming with you. That was decided months ago—years, really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut up,” Ron advised him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. “I’ve been packing for days, so we’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eye’s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron’s mum’s nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that they’re convinced that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>88</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 6. THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life’s ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That’s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me—or you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit about you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don’t—well, I think I’ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don’t know that they’ve got a daughter, you see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arms around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—Hermione, I’m sorry—I didn’t—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you’ve done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go on, he needs to know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, all right. Harry, come here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half, moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have a look at him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>89</p>
<p class="calibre1">curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“no,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas. he was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s me, see?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. “I don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in my room,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to it—well, it’s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool—but he nods a lot when you mention it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, he’s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry merely looked his confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at Hogwarts again,everyone’s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they’ve got information on where you are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle—borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and they can’t all leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re going to put out the story that I’m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or dad can show then the ghoul in my bed, cov-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>90</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 6. THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">ered in pustules. Spattergroit’s really contagious, so they’re not going to want to go near him. It won’t matter that he can’t say anything, either, because apparently you can’t once the fungus has spread to your uvula.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum . . . well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re going till we’ve gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw books into one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other. The measures they had taken to protect their families made him realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find words important enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four floors below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said Ron. “I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the weddings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“what we really need to decide,” said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, “is where we’re going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why, but . . . well . . . shouldn’t we make the Horcruxes our priority?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with you,” said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to Godric’s Hollow. His parents graves were only part of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>91</p>
<p class="calibre1">Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it happened, wanting to understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect you to go back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This R.A.B. person,” he said, “You know, the one who stole the real locket?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He said in his note that he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.’s note was still folded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can,’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry read out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, what if he did finish it off?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or she.” interposed Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren’t we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s destroyed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” asked Harry. “I didn’t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. “Dumbledore removed them all, but he—he didn’t destroy them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It—it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. “They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder to—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get to the point!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>92</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 6. THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well . . . it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I just did a Summoning Charm. You know—Accio. And. . . they zoomed out of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just after his—Dumbledore’s—funeral,” said Hermione in an even smaller voice. “Right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it—it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I—I packed them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you hear us complaining?” said Ron. “Where are these books anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secrets of the Darkest Art—it’s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library. . . . If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d already read that?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux but the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think you’re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the more horrible</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>93</p>
<p class="calibre1">they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond “usual evil.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be excruciatingly painful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails. “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly rare—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,” said Hermione, “Our problem is that the are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all dangerous to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “Why can’t the bit of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>94</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 6. THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul in it just go and live in something else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron. Harry Laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive untouched,” said Hermione. “But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on it’s container, its enchanted body, for survival, It can’t exist without it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort’s soul as it vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don’t mean holding it for long, it’s nothing to do with touching it,” she added before Ron could speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry. “Why didn’t I ask him? I never really . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more . . . to find out everything . . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>95</p>
<p class="calibre1">crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art. Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said, her voice trembling. “ I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt on her feet, sending books flying in every direction, “we will . . . we’re sorry . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione, hurried out of the room after Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without the job satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’ll be like a holiday, won’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room, stopped quite abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots, though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>96</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 6. THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usually contingent of capering gnomes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had lost track of how many security enhancements had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green robes, who could only be Fleur’s mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. “Papa!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her flustered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur tells us you</p>
<p class="calibre1">’ave been working very ’ard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trouble at all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley’s hand between his two plump ones and beaming. “We are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let me present my wife, Apolline.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enchantée,” she said. ”Your ’usband ’as been telling us such amusing stories!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!” said Monsieur</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>97</p>
<p class="calibre1">Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist—</p>
<p class="calibre1">length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, com in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and “After you!”s and “Not at all!”s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Delacours, as it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids’ shows “Charmant!” Madame Delacour was most accom-plished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she could and jab-bering away in rapid French. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy’s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the wedding,” she explained, pausing to lean against the hen-house. She looked exhausted. “Millamant’s Magic Marquees . . . they’re very good. Bill’s escorting them. . . . You’d better stay inside while they’re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>98</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 6. THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS</p>
<p class="calibre1">security spells around the place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry,” said Harry humbly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I didn’t mean—well, your safety’s much more important! Actually, I’ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want a fuss,” said Harry quickly, envisaging the addition strain this would put on them all. “Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . It’s the day before the wedding. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please don’t go to loads of trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not at all, not at all . . . It’s no trouble. . . . ” She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened up, and walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hewaswalkingalongamountainroadinthecoolbluelightof dawn. Far below, swathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the man he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who held the answer, the answer to his problem . . . ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oi, wake up,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron’s dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing. the scar on Harry’s forehead was prickling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were muttering in your sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. ‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face appeared slightly blurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s Gregorovitch?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the 99</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>100</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">name before, but he could not think where. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think Voldemort’s looking for him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor bloke,” said Ron fervently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think he’s abroad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who, Gregorovitch?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort. I think he’s somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn’t look like anywhere in Britain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron sounded worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do me a favor and don’t tell Hermione,” said Harry. “Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking . . . Why was the name</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gregorovitch” familiar? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think,” he said slowly, “he’s got something to do with Quidditch. there’s some connection, but I can’t—I can’t think what it is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quidditch?” said Ron. “Sure you’re not thinking of Gorgovitch?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, “I’m definitely not think of Gorgovitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I try not to either,” said Ron. “Well, happy birthday anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow—that’s right, I forgot! I’m seventeen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said “Accio Glasses!” Although they were only around a foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, or at least until they poked him in the eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slick,” snorted Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron’s possessions flying</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>101</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron’s Chudley Cannons posters right blue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately checked it. “Here’s your present. Unwrap it up here, it’s not for my mother’s eyes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A book?” said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. “Bit of a departure from tradition, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This isn’t your average book,” said Ron. “It’s pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I wouldn’t have known how to get going with . . . Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I’ve learned a lot. You’d be surprised, it’s not all about wandwork, either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. ”He had to leave early for work, but he’ll be back for dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s our present on top.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the face instead of hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age.” said Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the corner. “I’m afraid that one isn’t new like Ron’s, it was actually my brother Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back, but-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her, He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>102</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">because she patted his check clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon out of the frying pan onto the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. “It’s not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?” she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, then, open Hermione’s! said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur. (“Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will eve ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour assured him, “but you must tell it clearly what you want . . . ozzerwise you might find you ’ave a leetle less hair zan you would like. . . .”), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll pack these for you,” Hermione said brightly, taking Harry’s presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. “I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, will you come in here a moment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Ginny, Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow rugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden flag on top was level with Ginny’s window. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>103</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny looked up into Harry’s face, took a deep breath, and said, “Happy seventeenth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. . . thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difficult to look back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She ignored this. He could not blame her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You didn’t have to get me anything.” She disregarded this too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn’t be able to take it with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He chanced a glance at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brother must have toughened her up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She took a step closer to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair—</p>
<p class="calibre1">The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Ron pointedly. “Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron!” Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath. There was a strained silence, then Ginny said in a flat little voice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though i cold drain had entered the room</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>104</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">when the door appeared, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at Ginny wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mow lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around/” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Ron held up a hand to silence her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She was really cut up when you ended it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I wanted to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes up again—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to—to end up married, or—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered, whereas his . . . he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you keep groping her every chance you get—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>105</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well, that’s . . . yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie’s arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns, all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s ministrations, George’s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins many jokes about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice,” said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. “You’ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out of the way, out of the way¡‘ sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>106</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, it’s nothing, dear.” she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brow suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry’s hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Happy birthday, Harry,” she said, hugging him tightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seventeen, eh!” said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred. “Six years ter the day we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at him. “Didn’t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I forge’ the details,” Hagrid Chortled. “All righ’, Ron, Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re fine,” said Hermione. “Who are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I’ll show yeh when yeh get back—” Harry avoided Ron’s and Hermione’s gazes and Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. “Here, Harry—couldn’ think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. “Mokeskin. Hide anythin’ in there an’ no one but the owner can get it out. They’re rare, them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid, thanks!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand, “An’ there’s Charlie! always liked him—hey! Charlie!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscly arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. How’s Norbert doin”’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>107</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Norbert?” Charlie laughed. “The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Nor-berta now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wha—Norbert’s a girl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah,” said Charlie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can you tell?” asked Hermione</p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re a lot more vicious.” said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice. “Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum’s getting edgy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we’d better start without Arthur,” she called to the garden at large after a moment or two. “He must have been held up at—oh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minister of Magic coming with me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur’s family peering in astonishment where it had vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once. “Harry—I’m sorry—I’ll explain another time—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He seized Tonks’s wrist and pulled her away; the reached the fence, climbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Minister—but why—? I don’t understand—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">the two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>108</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Especially as I can see that I am gate crashing a party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Many happy returns.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went on. “Also with Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised, “Why us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said Scrimgeour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er, sitting room, why don’t you use that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen and into the Burrow’s sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in here. Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have some questions for the three of your and I think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two“—he pointed at Harry and Hermione—” can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can speak to us together, or not at all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>109</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the minister was wondering it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well then, together,” he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. “I am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore’s will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A surprise, apparently? You were not aware the that Dumbledore had left you anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A—all of us?” said Ron. “Me and Hermione too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, all of—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. “They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had no right to do that!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively. “The Decree for Justifi-able Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,” said Hermione, “and the Ministry is supposed to have evidence that the deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m not,” retorted Hermione. “I’m hoping to do some good in the world!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron laughed, Scrimgeour’s eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can’t you think of a pretext to keep them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up,” said Hermione at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>110</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous. Right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?” asked Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me? No—not really . . . It was always Harry who . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione to see Hermione giving him a stop—talking—now! sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron’s answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions—his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects—were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I . . . dunno,” said Ron, “I . . . when I say we weren’t close . . . I mean, I think he liked me. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione. “Dumbledore was very fond of you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was stretching the truth to breaking points as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore’</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . Yes, here we are. . . . ’To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour took something from the bag an object that Harry had seen before. It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in his fingers, looking stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>111</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s ow design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron shook his head, looking bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,” Scrimgeour persevered. “Yet the only one he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else could I do with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Arts upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour</p>
<p class="calibre1">“He . . . he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why that particular book?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. “And if the Ministry still hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficultly extracting his arm to put it around Hermione’s shoulders. Scrim-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>112</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">geour turned back to the will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’To Harry James Potter,’”he read, and Harry’s insides contracted with a sudden excitement, ”’I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling definite sense of anti-climax. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read out, I suppose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere ad whatever it was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think this is a mere symbolic keepsake, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m asking the questions,” said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,” Scrimgeour said to Harry. “Why is that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione laughed derisively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact that Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s way too obvious,” she said. “There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrimgeour, “but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I’m sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry though that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because Snitches have flesh memories,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione’s Quidditch knowledge negligible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>113</p>
<p class="calibre1">released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in the case of disputed capture. This Snitch”—he held up the tiny golden ball—“will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione’s mind; he could practically hear her brain whirring beside him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry met the minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry’s palm. Nothing happened. As Harry’s fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to prise herself off the sofa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now, “Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The sword of Godric Gryffindor,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>114</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumbledore’s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor,” said Scrimgeour. “That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. “Why do you think—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said Harry, struggling to keep his temper. “Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this is what you’ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying—I was nearly one of them—Voldemort chased me across three countries, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand: It singed a hole in Harry’s T-shirt like a lit cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>115</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry’s face. “Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s time you learned some respect!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s time you earned it.” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We—we thought we heard—” began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—raised voices,” panted Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry’s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It—it was nothing,” he growled. “I . . . regret your attitude,” he said, looking Harry full in the face once more. “You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you—what Dumbledore—desired. We ought to be working together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t like your methods, Minister,” said Harry. “Remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrimgeour’s expression hardened. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, “He’s gone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did he want?” Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To give us what Dumbledore left us,” said Harry. “They’ve only just released the contents of his will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>116</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, “Harry, dear, everyone’s awfully hungry, we didn’t like to start without you. . . . Shall I serve dinner now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of “Happy Birthday” and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meet us upstairs,” Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. “After everyone’s gone to bed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Muffliato,” she whispered, waving her hand in the direction of the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Deluminator.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>117</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything he’d left us?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ . . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through the The Tales of Beedle the Bard. “If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always said he was mental. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch—what the hell was that about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. “I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?” said Harry. “Don’t you remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was the one you nearly swallowed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,” said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore’s: I open at the close. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>118</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 7. THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had barely read them when the words vanished again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I open at the close . . . ’ What’s that supposed to mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I open at the close. . . at the close . . . I open at the close . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different in-flections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription. “Why did he want Harry to have the sword?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said quietly. “I was there it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give it to me then? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And as for this book” said Hermione, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard . . . I’ve never even heard of them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” said Ron incredulously. “You’re kidding, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m not.” said Hermione in surprise. “Do you know them, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, of course I do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh come on! All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s, aren’t they? ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’ . . . ‘The Wizard and the Hopping Pot’</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me?” said Hermione, giggling. “What was that last one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>119</p>
<p class="calibre1">must’ve heard of Bubbitty Rabbitty—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!” said Hermione. “We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So these are children’s stories?” asked Hermione, bending again over the runes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Ron uncertainly, “I mean, that’s just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like in the original versions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something creaked downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered Hermione. “It wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” agreed Ron. “A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother might put a bit of a damper of the wedding. I’ll get the lights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Wedding</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Threeo’clockonthefollowingafternoonfoundHarry,Ron,Fred,and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as “Cousin Barny” and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree. Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden hairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The supporting poles are entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butter-flies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was 121</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>122</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer’s day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, “I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said George. “Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves—</p>
<p class="calibre1">here they come, look.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches’ hats, while precious gems glittered from man of the wizards’ cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,” said George, craning his neck for a better look. “They’ll need help understanding our English customs, I’ll look after them. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not so fast, Your Holeyness,” said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession, he said, “Here—permettez-moi to assiter vous,” to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry’s lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wotcher,” said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. “Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,” she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. “The Ministry’s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s fine, I understand.” said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin’s face</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>123</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having misunderstood Fred’s directions he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tas-sel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Xenophilius Lovegood,” he said, extending a hand to Harry, “my daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. but I think you know my Luna?” he added to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Ron. “Isn’t she with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes—or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,” said Ron, “but I think Fred and George taught them those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Harry!” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er—my name’s Barny,” said Harry, flummoxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, have you changed that too?” she asked brightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you know—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, just your expression,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had ac-cessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you got over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>124</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangling from her ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Bidding the wizards farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, “Daddy, look—one of the gnomes actually hit me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!” said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna’s outstretched finger and examining the bleeding puncture marks. “Luna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today—</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish—do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud snort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron can laugh,” said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, “bu my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views. “Are you sure you don’t want to put anything on that bite, though?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, it’s fine,” said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down. “You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching her arm. Her beaky nose, red-trimmed eyes, and feathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ . . . and you hair’s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin’s beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?” she barked at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn’t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—he couldn’t come—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>125</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I’ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara.” she shouted at Harry. “Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She’s a good-looking girl, but still—French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time. When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee was nearly full now, and for the first time there was no queue outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. “She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she’ll have written them out of her will—like they care, they’re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they’re going. . . . Wow,” he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. “You look great!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Always the tone of surprise,” said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, lilac=colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. “Your Great—Aunt Muriel doesn’t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She says, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?’ and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. “Yeah, she’ just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,” conceded George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party.” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>126</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never married, for some reason,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You amaze me,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You look vunderful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate with its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, “I didn’t know you were—goodness—it’s lovely to see—how are you again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum’s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, “How come you’re here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fleur invited me,” said Krum, eyebrows raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron’s vicinity, offered to show him his seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You friend is not pleased to see me,” said Krum as he entered the now packed marquee. “Or is he a relative?” he added with a glance at Harry’s red curly hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time to sit down, ” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run over by the bride.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>127</p>
<p class="calibre1">and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a few moments he muttered to Harry, “Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives: Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst-colored robes with a matching hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, with large white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooooh!” said Hermione, swivelling around in her seat to look at the entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dresses and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everyone it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of bill and Fleur. “We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. “But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>128</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. they seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person’s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle. . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth=sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ . . . then I declare you bonded for life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst: Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ladies and gentlemen!” called the tuft-haired wizard. “If you would please stand up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The seats on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs groped themselves around small white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth around it, and the golden-jacketed hand trooped toward a podium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Smooth,” said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, other tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We should go and congratulate them!” said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>129</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll have time later,” shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. “Hermione, cop hold, let’s grab a table. . . . Not there! Nowhere near Muriel—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the Marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right if we join you?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Daddy’s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur’s father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quit alone, eyes closed and waving her arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly. “Always good value.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, “Who is that man in the yellow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a friend of ours,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. “Come and dance,” he added abruptly to Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, they are together now?” asked Krum, momentarily distracted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er—sort of,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>130</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are you?” Krum asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Barny Weasley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They shook hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You, Barny—you know this man Lovegood vell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I only met him today. Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because,” said Krum, “if he was not a guest of Fleur’s, I would duel him here and now, for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sign?” said Harry, looking at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. “Why? What’s wrong with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he says, “Grindelvald killed many people my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never poverful in this country, they said he feared Dumbledore—and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this”—he pointed a finger a Xenophilius—“this is his symbol, recognized it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it into their books and clothes, thinking to shock, make themselves impressive—until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna’s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you—er—quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not mistaken,” said Krum coldly. “I valked past that sign for several years, I know it vell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there’s a chance,” said Harry, “that Xenophilius doesn’t actually know what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are quite . . . unusual. He could easily</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>131</p>
<p class="calibre1">have picked it up somewhere and think it’s a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The cross section of a vot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I don’t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s her,” he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Vy is she doing that?” asked Krum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,” said Harry, who recognized the symptoms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it menacingly on his thigh; sparks flew out of the end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gregorovitch!” said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the memory came back to him at the sight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Vot about him?” asked Krum suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s a wandmaker!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know that,” said Krum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He made your wand! That’s why I thought—Quidditch—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum was looking more and more suspicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I . . . I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry. “In a—a fan magazine,” he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . er . . . where is Gregorovitch these days?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum looked puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best—although I know, of course, that you Britons</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>132</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">set much store by Ollivander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely because of what Harry’s wand had done on the night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. the holly and phoenix feather had conquered the borrowed wand, something that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. “She is also a relative of yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn’t want to cross him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum grunted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, “is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George’s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As the evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Freda and George had long since disappeared</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>133</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the darkness with a pair of Fleur’s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing ‘Odo the Hero” in a corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wandering through the crowd so as not to escape a drunken uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock as was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, the member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore’</p>
<p class="calibre1">obituary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry approached him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I sit down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry leaned in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doge gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. . . . I am so glad, so honored!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a flutter a nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve thought o writing to you,” he whispered, “after Dumbledore . . . the shock . . . and for you, I am sure . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,” said Harry. “I didn’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As well as anyone,” said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. “Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count Aberforth—and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speaking of the Daily Prophet . . . I don’t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge—</p>
<p class="calibre1">?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>134</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">about Dumbledore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doge’s face flooded with angry color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her. I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, in that interview.” Harry went on, “Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved int he Dark Arts when he was young.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t believe a word of it!” said Dodge at once. “Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn’t Doge understand Harry’s need to be sure, to know everything? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, “Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand. “She’s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Muriel,” said Doge. “Yes, we were just discussing—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred a seven!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung around it with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she said to Harry. “Now, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, she’s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can’t wait to read it, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>135</p>
<p class="calibre1">and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. she took another large gulp of champagne, belched, and then said, “There’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he came so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ill—informed sniping,” said Doge, turning radish-colored again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You would say that, Elphias,” cackled Auntie Muriel. “I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry you think so,” said Doge, more coldly still. “I assure you I was writing from the heart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you’ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Muriel!” exclaimed Doge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry’s chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” he asked Muriel. “Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Auntie Muriel, looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">delighted at the effect she had produced. “Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it! It all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That’s why I can’t wait to find out what Skeeter’s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Untrue!” wheezed Doge, “Absolutely untrue!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, “is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?” squawked Muriel, “Why did half of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>136</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">us never even know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean, locked in the cellar?” asked Harry. “What is this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggleborn, though I heard she pretended otherwise—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mor-tified to produce a Squib—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ariana was not a Squib!” wheezed Doge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. “In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn’t exist—–“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I tell you, that’s not what happened!” said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steam-rollered on, still addressing Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to in-tegrate into the Muggle community. . . much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school—–“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately. “Her health was always too poor to permit her—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—to permit her to leave the house?” cackled Muriel. “And yet she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know whether—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mungo’s at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>137</p>
<p class="calibre1">had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore’s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? Had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, if Kendra hadn’t died first,” Muriel resumed, “I’d have said that it was she who finished off Ariana—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can you, Muriel!” groaned Doge. “A mother kill her own daughter? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think what you’re saying!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?” shrugged Auntie Muriel. “But as I say, it doesn’t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana—of what, nobody ever seemed sure—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,” said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. “Shake your head all you like, Elphias. You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips, ”and a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’ nose halfway through the service?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you—?” croaked Doge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,” said Auntie Muriel happily. “Bathilda described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus’ fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>138</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1">odd enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe. He wanted the truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, hiccuping slightly as she lowered her goblet. “I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores—goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bathilda, would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of A History of Magic?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s textbooks, though admittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning man at a life heir. “A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheerfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,” said Auntie Muriel “But even if Bathilda’s completely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. . . . Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he asked, “Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>139</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie Muriel testily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric’s Hollow. Why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore’s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily’s and James’s to do so? And he had never once told Harry . . . never bothered to say . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. “Ron’s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It’s a bit odd. I’ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna’s father, it looked like they’d been arguing—“ She dropped her voice, staring at him. “Harry, are you okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the Patronus’s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.” “The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.” “The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.” “The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>140</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 8. THE WEDDING</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 9</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">A Place to Hide</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Everythingseemedfuzzy,slow. HarryandHermionejumpedto their feet and drew their wands. Many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed. Then somebody screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron!” Hermione cried. “Ron, where are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout, “Protego!”, a cry that was echoed on all sides—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron! Ron!” Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffered by terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren’t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know—</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione’s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as dark-141</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>142</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 9. A PLACE TO HIDE</p>
<p class="calibre1">ness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was Hermione’s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are we?” said Ron’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all; They still seemed to be surrounded by people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for you to change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,” Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?” said Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. “All last year I kept it on me and—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you,” said Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just try and act naturally until—this will do.” She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . . ” said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How the ruddy hell—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. “Tricky, but I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.” She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. “Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she said, peering into it, “and I had them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>143</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, you’d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When did you do all this?” Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag. “Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The others—everybody at the wedding—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t worry about that now,” whispered Hermione. “It’s you they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s right,” said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could not see his face. “Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.” Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, “Yeah.” But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” Ron asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,” said Ron, looking around, “but don’t you feel a bit—exposed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where else is there?” asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf-whistling at her. “We can hardly book rooms at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>144</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 9. A PLACE TO HIDE</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my parents’ home, though I think there’s a chance they might check there. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. “Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road. “Look, this will do, in here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a small and shabby all-night caf. A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a minute or two, Ron said, “You know, we’re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, we can’t!” said Hermione at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, okay, it was just an idea!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the caf and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once we’re there, we could send a message to the Order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they might’ve been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>145</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrested already. God, that’s revolting,” Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers’ orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said Ron. “Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, “Stupefy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot—the waitress screamed and ran for the door—Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Petrificus Totalus!” screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D-diffindo,” she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>146</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 9. A PLACE TO HIDE</p>
<p class="calibre1">slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,” he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a little hysterically. “How did they find us? What are we going to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lock the door,” he told her, “and Ron, turn out the lights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the caf into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are we going to do with them?” Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them? They’d kill us. They had a good go just now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We just need to wipe their memories,” said Harry. “It’s better like that, it’ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it’d be obvious we were here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. “But I’ve never down a Memory Charm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov’s forehead and said, “Obliviate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back. “Take care of the other</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>147</p>
<p class="calibre1">one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clear up?” said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf. “Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been bombed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh right, yeah . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they’re tight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the café was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how did they find us?” Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. “How did they know where we were?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He can’t have,” said Ron. “The Trace breaks at seventeen, that’s Wizarding law, you can’t put it on an adult.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As far as you know,” said Hermione. “What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Harry hasn’t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who’s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the Death Eaters had found them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near me, without us giving away our position—“ he began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re not splitting up!” said Hermione firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need a safe place to hide,” said Ron. “Give us time to think things through.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>148</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 9. A PLACE TO HIDE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other two gaped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him—and even if they haven’t worked,” he pressed on as Hermione began to argue “so what? I swear, I’d like nothing better than to meet Snape!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, where else is there? It’s the best chance we’ve got. Snape’s only one Death Eater. If I’ve still got the Trace on me, we’ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the caf door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the caf’s light. Then, on Harry’s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seconds later Harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius’s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll’s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>149</p>
<p class="calibre1">knocked it over again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione whispered, pointing toward it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron murmured back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?” Harry asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther into the house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Severus Snape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mad-Eye Moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in fright. “We’re not Snape!” croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, “That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. “No! It wasn’t us! We didn’t kill you—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying, “It’s all r-right. . . . It’s g-gone. . . . ” Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>150</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 9. A PLACE TO HIDE</p>
<p class="calibre1">as Mrs. Black continued to scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“SHUT UP!” Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That . . . that was . . . “ Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, “but it wasn’t really him, was it? Just something to scare Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, “Homenum revelio.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you’ve just had a big shock,” said Ron kindly. “What was that supposed to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It did what I meant it to do!” said Hermione rather crossly. “That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there’s nobody here except us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And old Dusty,” said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had risen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “And you’d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I know they can’t get in the house, but—what’s up, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>151</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned against as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you see?” Ron asked, advancing on Harry. “Did you see him at my place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I just felt anger—he’s really angry—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that could be at the Burrow,” said Ron loudly. “What else? Didn’t you see anything? Was he cursing someone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I just felt anger—I couldn’t tell—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, “Your scar, again? But what’s going on? I thought that connection had closed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It did, for a while,” muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard to concentrate. “I-I think it’s started opening again whenever he loses control, that’s how it used to—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said Hermione shrilly. “Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius’s death. He wished that he had no told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>152</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 9. A PLACE TO HIDE</p>
<p class="calibre1">solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father. “Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. “They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. “It’s your family, ’course you were worried. I’d feel the same way.” He thought of Ginny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do feel the same way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had back in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say “I don’t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought and camp in here tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer. He had to succumb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bathroom,” he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the giant blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face—with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>153</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy’s gaunt, petrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione’s voice rang out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I’ve got it here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, great, thanks,” he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">Kreacher’s Tale</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harrywokeearlynextmorning,wrappedinasleepingbagon the drawing room floor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains. It was the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione’s slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron’s. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than twenty—four house ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was going to happen now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting complex mission Dumbledore had left him. . . . Dumbledore . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore’s death felt different now. The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things, infecting his memories of the wizard 155</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>156</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore’s will, and resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn’t he explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bad, picked up his wand, and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, “Lumos,” and started to climb the stairs by wandlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died? Harry’s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-grandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster’s study at Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never entered his godfather’s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible. The room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs still resting in its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>157</p>
<p class="calibre1">sockets, solid wax banging in frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed’s headboard; a spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper into the room, he head a scurrying of disturbed mice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius’s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest son’s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have lone gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and hold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls. Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast the only Wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father, his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius’s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brightest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>158</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">A shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius’s bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the covers and sundry pages littered the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He recognized one as a part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Barhilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. He smoothed it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Padfoot, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank you, thank you, for Harry’s birthday present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself. I’m enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course James thought it was so funny, says he’s going to be a great Quidditch player, but we’ve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don’t take our eyes off him when he gets going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come first, and Harry’s not old enough to know it’s his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell—also Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here last weekend. I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the next about the McKinnons; I cried all evening when I heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bathilda drops in most days, she’s a fascinating old thing with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>159</p>
<p class="calibre1">the most amazing stories about Dumbledore. I’m not sure he’d be pleased if he knew! I don’t know how much to believe, actually because it seems incredible that Dumbledore Harry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief thundering its equal measure through his veins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurching to the bed, he sat down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had made her “g”s the same way he did. He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had a cat . . . perhaps it had perished, like his parents at Godric’s Hollow . . . or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it. . . Sirius had bought him his first broomstick . . . His parents had known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced them? Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . there was something funny there . . . Harry paused, pondering his mother’s words. Why had Dumbledore taken James’s Invisibility Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before, “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible” Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as a carrier? Harry passed on. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wormy was here . . . Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed “down” had he? Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems incredible that Dumbledore—</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>160</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance or had taken up goat charming like Aberforth. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. He seized papers, treating them in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher, he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph that Lily had described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to look for the second sheet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After another quarter of an hour, however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mother’s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters . . . The only potentially useful thing he could see her was possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore—what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry? Harry? Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m here!” he called, “What’s happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breathlessly. She turned and shouted over her shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found him” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>161</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room. “What have you been doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look what I’ve just found” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He held out his mother’s letter. Hermione took it out and read it while Harry watched her. When she reached the end of the page she looked up at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh Harry . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And there’s this too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but it’s not here” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione glanced around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone had searched before me,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What were they after, do you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Information on the Order, if it was Snape” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed. I mean was in the Order, wasn’t he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about information on Dumbledore? The second page of the letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A History of Magic,” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents knew her? She was an incredible magic historian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hollow. Ron’s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore’s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>162</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 10. KREACHER’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">for Harry’s liking. He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at her and give himself away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about, and Dumbledore too,” said Hermione. “But that wouldn’t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, “Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared. I’m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I’m sure they’d be expecting you to visit it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not just that,” Harry said, still avoiding looking at her, “Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had finished, Hermione said, “Of course, I can see why that’s upset you, Harry—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true or—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought I did,” he muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again: Choose what to believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall we go down to the kitchen?” Hermione suggested after a little pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Find something for breakfast?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed in the dark. He passed at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a porapous little sign, neatly lettered by hand the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>163</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do Not Enter</p>
<p class="calibre1">Without the Express Permission of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regulus Arcturus Black</p>
<p class="calibre1">Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He read the sign again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him. </p>
