<p class="calibre1">Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a long pause he said. “How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my little sister?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. ”Why didn’t he say to him, ’Take care of yourself, here’s how to survive’ ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you’ve got to think about the greater good! This is war!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re seventeen, boy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who says I’ve given up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Order of the Phoenix is finished,” Harry repeated, “You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it isn’t.” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to keep going until I succeed—or I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p483"></a>483</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t help us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us—well, now would be a great time to mention it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what to do,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, one of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er—what—?” began Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must know they’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies. . . well, that’s your lookout, isn’t it? You say you’re prepared to die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what . . . ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And our of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. “I knew you’d come! I knew it, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p484"></a>484</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 28. THE MISSING MIRROR</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p485"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 29</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Lost Diadem</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville—whatthe—how—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville</p>
<p class="calibre1">, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, “I knew you’d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville, what’s happened to you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is nothing, Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple more people on the way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Caurwauling Charm on the whole village!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, that’s why the’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,” said Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel, Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed 485</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p486"></a>486</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 29. THE LOST DIADEM</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our lives twice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly. “I might not be able to save</p>
<p class="calibre1">’em a third time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hold behind Ariana’s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the outside: It looked as though the passageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set off. “It isn’t on the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of the school?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said Neville. “There’s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.” He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. “Never mind that stuff. . . . Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Teddy Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville laughed gleefully, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you do with the dragon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t exaggerate, Ron—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re right,” said Harry. “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’t heard anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s been. . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p487"></a>487</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all discipline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They like punishment, the Carrows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like Umbridge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us the the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it’s just Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the passage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in anything, I expect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alecto, Amycus’ sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ron, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville’s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p488"></a>488</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 29. THE LOST DIADEM</p>
<p class="calibre1">the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I know, she managed to met a message to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore’s Army had used to send one another messages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione. “The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore’s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape hated it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past tense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville. “We lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of leaders. The Carrows seemed to know that I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No kidding,” muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, “well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,” he faced them, and Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p489"></a>489</p>
<p class="calibre1">was astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living along,e the probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,” Neville laughed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that I’m my parents’ son, and to keep it up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over e, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to disappear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t—aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana’s portrait. Neville pushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out to unseen people:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s Potter, it’s POTTER!” “Ron!” “Hermione!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people: They might just have won a Quidditch final. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in their surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous, and rather looked like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p490"></a>490</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 29. THE LOST DIADEM</p>
<p class="calibre1">were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden-cased wireless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville. “Surpassed itself, hasn’t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings, But it’s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the Carrows can’t get in?” asked Harry, looking around for the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke: Seamus’ face was bruised and puffy. “It’s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t open. It’s all down to Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He really gets this room. You’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need—like, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in—and it’ll do it for you! </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville’s the man!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville modestly. “I’d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that’s when the passage to Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yea, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Seamus, “and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p491"></a>491</p>
<p class="calibre1">were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. “There’ve been so many rumors, we’ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch,” He pointed at the wireless. “You didn’t break into Gringotts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside some shack, an the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want to sit down? I expect you’re tired, aren’t—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that Voldemort has just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to get going,” he said, and their expression told him that they understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus. “What’s the plan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to Voldemort’s rage: His scar was still burning. “Well, there’s something we—Ron, Hermione, and I—need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean, ’get out of here’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p492"></a>492</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 29. THE LOST DIADEM</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain. “There’s something important we need to do—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I can’t tell you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville’s brows contracted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yeah—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then we’ll help you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, other solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t understand,” Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. “We—we can’t tell you. We’ve got to do it—alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” asked Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because. . . ” In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts; His scar was still searing. “Dumbledore left the three of us a job,” he said carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell—I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army. We were all in it together, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own—</p>
<p class="calibre1">” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t trust us. Everyone in this room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal to Dumbledore—</p>
<p class="calibre1">loyal to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter: the tunnel door had just opened behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p493"></a>493</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We got your message, Neville! Hello, you three, I thought you must be here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be back!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luna,” said Harry distractingly, “what are you doing here? How did you—</p>
<p class="calibre1">?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. “I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly, “Isn’t it, Harry? We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to do, and then—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded Michael Corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be a part of it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His head seemed to fall: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, he had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less please to see her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. “He wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a railway station.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake Galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p494"></a>494</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 29. THE LOST DIADEM</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did you call them all back for? This is insane—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re fighting aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. “The message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I’ll have to get a wand, though—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You haven’t got a wand—?” began Seamus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron turned suddenly to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why can’t they help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between then, “We don’t know where it is, We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to tell them it’s a Horcrux.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, “I think Ron’s right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need them.” And when Harry looked unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus. . . he was a natural. . . Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them looked alert, excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said. “Something—something</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p495"></a>495</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It’s here at Hogwarts, but we don’t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it, for instance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny’s chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy’s trying to duplicate it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, “is lost, Luna. That’s sort of the point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When was it lost?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart sank. “Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,” she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws. “nobody’s ever found a trace of it, have they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all shook their heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s was supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry cut across Luna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the caste. . . . Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaw’s wearing it in her statue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p496"></a>496</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 29. THE LOST DIADEM</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know; Either way, there was hardly any time left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron ad Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at them. “Listen, I know it’s not much of a lead, but I’m going to go and look at this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you know—the other one—safe,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, “No, Luna will take Harry, won’t you, Luna?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho sat down again, looking disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He lead Harry and Luna into a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able to find it,” he said. “Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they’re always patrolling the corridors at night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No problem.” said Harry. “See you in a bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his nose he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p497"></a>497</p>
<p class="calibre1">search, and located his and Luna’s dots at last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They crept off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never has his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended oh his safe passage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, un-connected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence, it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft musical voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm. . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? Isn’t there just a password?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What if you get it wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said Luna. “That way you learn, you see?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. . . Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well then, I think the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p498"></a>498</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 29. THE LOST DIADEM</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer is that a circle has no beginning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful etched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks; By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p499"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 30</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Sacking of Severus</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">Snape</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">ThemomentherfingertouchedtheMark,Harry’sscarburnedsav-agely, the starry room vanished from sight, and he was standing upon an overcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around him and there was triumph in his heart—They have the boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,” said Luna, sounding mildly interested. “That was noisier than I thought it would be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories: Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the common room. There were gasps and cries o surprise as they say Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in 499</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p500"></a>500</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 30. THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. “They’re pleased!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. . . great. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort’s mind. . . . He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming. . . but that would not take him long. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker: “Where do Vanished objects go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno, do I? Shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother, Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter—d’you want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!” Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast the door open and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trying—to get—through this damned—door!” shouted Amycus. “Go and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But isn’t your sister in there?” asked Professor McGonagall. “Didn’t Pro-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p501"></a>501</p>
<p class="calibre1">fessor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at you urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn’t wake up half the castle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it, now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a gentle tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where do Vanished objects go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything.” replied Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed. “I’ll Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it—and what’s the Dark Lord going to say?” he shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist, “We haven’t got him, and they’ve gone and killed her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s only Stunned,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped down to examine Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus. “Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She’s gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we’ve got Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got Potter?” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “What do you mean, ’got Potter’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We was told he might come in here!” said Carrow. “I dunno why, do I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p502"></a>502</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 30. THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his piglike face suddenly crafty. “Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. We’ll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, then kids up there”—he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“and we’ll say they forced her to press the Mark, and that’s why he got a false alarm. . . . He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what’s the difference?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,” said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, “a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva McGonagall. You time’s over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay the price.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he spat in her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You shouldn’t have done that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, “you need to really mean it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. “Potter—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re here! What—?How—?” She struggled to pull herself together. “Potter, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p503"></a>503</p>
<p class="calibre1">that was foolish!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He spat at you,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter, I—that was very—very gallant of you—but don’t you realize—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. “Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” Harry told Luna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He already knows where I am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat. . . . He had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The d—diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not—hasn’t it been lost for centuries?” She sat up a little straighter. “Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something hidden here that I’m supposed to find, and it could be the diadem—if i could just speak to Professor Flitwick—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was coming around. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointing her want at the groggy Death Eater, and said, “Imperio.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p504"></a>504</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 30. THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament. “if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are here—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry came back. He was clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m acting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we’ve got to get the students out while I’m searching the castle—It’s me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a few more or less, not now—”’ not now he knows I’m attacking Horcruxes. Harry finished the sentence in his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you search for this—this object.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that possible?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put out best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and if Hogwarts is about to enter a stage of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the Hog’s Head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p505"></a>505</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in anyone who’s Disapparating out of Hog’s Head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. “Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You’d better put that Cloak back on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs, Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first. He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s Map, but before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their company, She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, “Who’s there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is I,” said a low voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten the details of Snape’s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p506"></a>506</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 30. THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape stopped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held up his wand tip too, ready to attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto had apprehended an intruder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave you that impression?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You Death Eaters have you own private means of communication, I forgot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I did not know that it was you night to patrol the corridors, Minerva.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have some objection?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder what could have brought you out of you bed at this hour?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? But all seems calm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape looked into her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I must insist—</p>
<p class="calibre1">” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed: Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers. Snape avoided them only be forcing the suit of armor in front</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p507"></a>507</p>
<p class="calibre1">of him, and with echoing clang, the dagger sank, one after another, into the breast—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professor Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in the nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” squeaking Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do more murder at Hogwarts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snap had taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers; Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him. He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You means he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“no, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand. . . and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing: Slughorn had just caught up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p508"></a>508</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 30. THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">green silk pajamas. “My dear boy. . . what a surprise. . . Minerva, do please explain. . . . Severus. . . what. . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with murder in his heart—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor, we’ve got the barricade the school, he’s coming now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,” she told the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan. “Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely?” said Professor Sprout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding. “I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. “I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, “Tentacula, Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff pod. . . yes, I’d like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could bare see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, “Professor, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p509"></a>509</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Protego Horribilis—the diadem of Ravenclaw?” squeaked Flitwick. “A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I only meant—do you know where it is? Have you seen it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, my boy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the Horcrux? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. “What a to-do! I’m not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great hall in twenty minutes, also,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minerva!” he said, aghast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,” interrupted Professor McGonagall. “Go and wake your students, Horace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and Luna ran after Professor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Piertotum—oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting, “Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re supposed to be here, you blithering idiot!” shouted McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p510"></a>510</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 30. THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“P—Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven’t you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And now—Piertotum Locomotor!” cried Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “May the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry some of them smaller, some of them larger, than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better return to you friends and bring them to the Great Hall—I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna turning back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wh—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p511"></a>511</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school—Snape’s run for it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">What are you doing here? How did you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,” Fred explained. “You couldn’t expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What first, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in the Great Hall to get organized,” Harry said. “We’re fighting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs, he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, and Harry’s old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand; she took it and followed him back up the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached. “I won’t permit it! They boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to get home!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I won’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m in Dumbledore’s Army—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A teenagers’ gang!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which no one she has dared to do!” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “She’s not old enough! What you two were thinking, bringing her with you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p512"></a>512</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 30. THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do this. Everyone underage will have to leave, it’s only right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. “My whole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes met Harry’s for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly, but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog’s Head. “I’ll say good-bye now, then, and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am I too late? Has it started? I only just found out, so I—I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension, “So—’ow eez leetle Teddy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to by solidifying, like ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—oh yes—he’s fine!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes, Tonks is with him—at her mother’s—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. “I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a—a—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron.” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy swallowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I was!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you can’t say fairer that that,” said Fred, holding out his hand to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p513"></a>513</p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry, Dad.” Percy said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. “But I had to find a way out and it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight for it, so here I am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,” said George in a good imitation of Percy’s most pompous manner. “Now let’s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters’ll be taken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you’re my sister-in-law now?” said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny has been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation, to sneak upstairs too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Molly, how about this,” said Lupin. “Why doesn’t Ginny stay here, then at least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on, but she won’t be in the middle of the fighting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s a good idea,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “Ginny, you stay in this room, you hear me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father’s unusually stern gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off for the stairs as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Ron?” asked Harry. “Where’s Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” Mr. Weasley called</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p514"></a>514</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 30. THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE</p>
<p class="calibre1">over his shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t see them pass me,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They said something about a bathroom,” said Ginny, “not long after you left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A bathroom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re sure that they said bath—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished: He was looking through the high wrought-iron gates with winded boars on pillars at either side, looking through the dark grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p515"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 31</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Battle of Hogwarts</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">TheenchantedceilingoftheGreatHallwasdarkandscatteredwith stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted. “And what if we want to stay and fight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a smattering of applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about our things?” called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. “Our trunks, our owls?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have no time to collect possessions,” said Professor McGonagall. “The 515</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p516"></a>516</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">important thing is to get you out of here safely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Professor Snape?” shouted a girl from the Slytherin table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione. As he paused, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor McGonagall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and so as your prefects—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, cold, and clean. There was no telling from where it came; it seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know you are preparing to fight.” There were screams amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. “Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none shall be harmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you should be rewarded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have until midnight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p517"></a>517</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them, with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awe-struck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and under sleeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are Ron and Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haven’t you found—?” began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers—Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor—where they’ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile Remus”—he indicated Lupin—“Arthur”—he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table—“and I will take groups</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p518"></a>518</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the grounds. We’ll need somebody to organize defense of the entrances of the passageways into the school—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds like a job for us,” called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his approval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, leaders up hear and we’ll divide up the troops!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, “Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then go, Potter, go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right—yeah—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron’s or Hermione’s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p519"></a>519</p>
<p class="calibre1">that house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem . . . and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In living memory . . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath his fingers, Harry’s eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of hundreds of people marching towards the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own Houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue; here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings . . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! My dear boy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as though they had been thrust into icy water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s got to be her—d’you know where she is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s see . . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p520"></a>520</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey—wait—come back!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. Close to, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re the Gray Lady?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She nodded but did not speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is correct.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her tone was not encouraging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A cold smile curved her lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot help you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WAIT!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is urgent,” he said fiercely. “If that diadem’s at Hogwarts, I’ve got to find it, fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” she said disdainfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Generations of students have badgered me—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry shouted at her. “It’s about Voldemort—defeating Voldemort—or aren’t you interested in that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p521"></a>521</p>
<p class="calibre1">She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, “Of course I—how dare you suggest—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, help me, then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her composure was slipping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It—it is not a question of—” she stammered. “My mother’s diadem—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your mother’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked angry with herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When I lived,” she said stiffly, “I was Helena Ravenclaw.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened to it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry said</p>
<p class="calibre1">fiercely. “There’s no time to explain—but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I stole the diadem from my mother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you did what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a in a whisper. “I sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then my mother fell ill-fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p522"></a>522</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a hot-tempered man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Baron? You mean—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. “When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence . . . as he should,” she added bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And . . . and the diadem?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where was this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother’s reach.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Albania,” repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already told someone this story, haven’t you? Another student?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She closed her eyes and nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had . . . no idea. . . . He was . . . flattering. He seemed to . . . to understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . to sympathize . . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed things out of,” Harry muttered. “He could be charming when he wanted. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p523"></a>523</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that lowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—the night he asked for a job!” said Harry, finishing his thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I beg your pardon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!” said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore’s office! But it was still worth trying to get the job—then he might’ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor’s sword as well . . . thank you, thanks!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet. “What the—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, yer here! Yer here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good boy, Grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in the window. “I’ll see</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p524"></a>524</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch. It was midnight. The battle had begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh? Time ter fight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid, where have you come from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,” said Hagrid grimly. “Voice carried, didn’ it? ‘Yeh got till midnight ter gimme Potter.’ Knew yeh mus’ be here, knew what mus’ be happenin’. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang. Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac’ly what I meant, bu’—where’s Ron an’ Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,” said Harry, “is a really good question. Come on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s heels, making the floorboards quake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno exactly,” said Harry, making another random turn, “but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly. “Oh, don’t mind me . . . I’ll just lie here and crumble. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius’s house, wearing that mad headdress—and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her white curls. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p525"></a>525</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school—here at last was a secret he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. “Going to lob them over the walls—they won’t like this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others’ canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all righ’, Fang—it’s all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving Harry alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony cantering behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p526"></a>526</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice night for it!” Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return them to their proper place . . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve had hundreds of kinds thundering through my pub, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, “Voldemort’s—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. Wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It wouldn’t stop Voldemort,” said Harry, “and your brother would never have done it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your brother would never have done it . . . . Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on again: Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom . . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chamber of Secrets,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p527"></a>527</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chamber—what?” said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Wasn’t it absolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even if we had the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn’t gotten rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What the—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something to get rid of Horcruxes,” said Ron simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how did you get in there?” he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You need to speak Parseltongue!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s what you did to open the locket,” he told Harry apologetically. “I had to have a few goes to get it right, but,” he shrugged modestly, “we got there in the end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was amazing!” said Hermione, “Amazing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . ” Harry was struggling to keep up. “So . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff ’s cup. “Hermione stabbed it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thought she should. She hasn’t had the pleasure yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Genius!” yelled Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was nothing,” said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. “So what’s new with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” said Harry, talking fast. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p528"></a>528</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Neville’s grand-mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Potter,” she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. “You can tell us what’s going on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is everyone okay?” said Ginny and Tonks together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’S far as we know,” said Harry. “Are there still people in the passage to the Hog’s Head?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs. Longbottom. “I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s fighting,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly. “Excuse me, I must go and assist him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at Tonks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’t stand not knowing—“ Tonks looked anguished. “She’ll look after him—have you seen Remus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Without another word, Tonks sped off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then you can come back in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. “You’ve got to come back in!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve forgotten someone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” asked Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p529"></a>529</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get out. We don’t want anymore Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them to die for us—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione’s arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “Oi! There’s a war going on here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or never, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry shouted. “D’you think you could just—just hold it in until we’ve got the diadem?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah—right—sorry—“ said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as more screams echoed from close by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p530"></a>530</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. “They look like they might be breaching the north battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, “haven’t seen him since!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll be all right,” said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe—come on!” he said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it inside his head, and the door materialized on their third run past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in my time . . . this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He passed the stuffed troll and the Vanish Cabinet Draco Malfoy had mended last year with such disastrous consequenecs, then hesitated, looking up and down aisles of junk; he could not remember we to go next. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accio Diadem!” cried Hermioen in desperation, but nothing flew through the air toward them. It seemed that, like the vault at Gringotts, the room would not yield its hidden objects that easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s split up.” Harry told the other two. “Look for a stone bust of an old</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p531"></a>531</p>
<p class="calibre1">man wearing a wig an a tiara! It’s standing on a cupboard and it’s definitely somewhere around here. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Somewhere near here,” Harry muttered to himself. “Somewhere . . . somewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver. There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few feet away, when a voice behind him said, “Hold it, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not anymore,” panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My mother,” said Draco. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person: Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe was speaking like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. “We</p>
<p class="calibre1">’ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p532"></a>532</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to distract them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,” said Malfoy, his voice brittle. “I know how to get in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle. “We can do Diss-lusion Charms now! And then,” his face split into a gormless grin, “you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What’s a die-dum?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry’s right. “Are you talking to someone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron!” Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, “Finite!” and it steadied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the latter made to repeat his spell. “If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that matter?” said Crabbe, tugging himself free. “It’s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues. “so that must mean—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Must mean’?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. “Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You an’ your dad are finished.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p533"></a>533</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wad. “What’s going on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry?” mimicked Crabbe. “What’s going on—no, Potter! Crucio!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him alive—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy’s restraining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what’s the diff—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy’s wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second’s hesitation was all Harry needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Expelliarmus!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione’s second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada Kedavra!” again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p534"></a>534</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">a Stunning Spell as she came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. “Look for it while I go and help R—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“HARRY!” she screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment’s warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aguamenti!” Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“RUN!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe out-stripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge. As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the de-tritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What can we do?” Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What can we do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p535"></a>535</p>
<p class="calibre1">junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere. He swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s—too—dangerous—!” Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good. Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy’s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry’s—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” roared Ron’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed Malfoy in Harry’s ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p536"></a>536</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way!” screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C-Crabbe,” choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. “C-Crabbe . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s dead,” said Ron harshly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all around him. He could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s Ginny?” he said sharply. “She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. “Shall we split up and look—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. “Let’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p537"></a>537</p>
<p class="calibre1">stick together. I say we go—Harry, what’s that on your arm?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? Oh yeah—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it; WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN’S GREATEST</p>
<p class="calibre1">TREASURE. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It must have been Fiendfyre!” whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken piece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fiendfyre-cursed fire—it’s one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it’s so dangerous—how did Crabbe know how to—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Must’ve learned from the Carrows,” said Harry grimly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,” said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione’s, was singed, and whose face was blackened. “If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d be quite sorry he was dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But don’t you realize?” whispered Hermione. “This means, if we can just get the snake—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thick-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p538"></a>538</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 31. THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS</p>
<p class="calibre1">nesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. “Did I mention I’m resigning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You actually are joking, Perce. . . . I don’t think I’ve heard you joke since you were—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart, Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them—</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry grabbed Hermione’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—no—no!” someone was shouting. “No! Fred! No!” And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred’s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p539"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 32</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Elder Wand</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Theworldhadended,sowhyhadthebattlenotceased,thecastle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying—</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get down!” Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred’s body, shielding it from further harm, and when Harry shouted</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Percy, come on, we’ve got to move!” he shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron’s face as he seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Percy, you can’t do anything for him! We’re going to—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall. one of Aragog’s descendants had joined the fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">539</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p540"></a>540</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 32. THE ELDER WAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry’s head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s move, NOW!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred’s body under the armpit. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped: together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well-hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: “ROOKWOOD!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen to me—LISTEN RON!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanna help—I wanna kill Death Eaters—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ron, we’re the only ones who can end it! Please—Ron—we need the snake, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p541"></a>541</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve got to kill the snake!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not—but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We will fight!” Hermione said. “We’ll have to, to reach the snake! But let’s not lose sight now of what we’re supposed to be d-doing! We’re the only ones who can end it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry. “You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he’ll have the snake with him, won’t he? Do it, Harry—look inside him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort’s thoughts? He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discover. . . He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem. . . although Dumbledore’s puppet had come much farther than he ever expected. . . too far. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p542"></a>542</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 32. THE ELDER WAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the punishment he had received after the boy’s last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. “My Lord. . . please. . . my son. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—never,” whispered Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You must hope not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t—aren’t you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at another hand but yours?” asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. “Wouldn’t it be. . . forgive me. . . more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him y-yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son. And i do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled him. . . and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rear-ranged. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go and fetch Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape, m-my Lord?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape. Now. I need him. There is a—service—I require from him. Go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p543"></a>543</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voldemort’s sitting in the shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged. “He’s not—he’s not even fighting??” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to go to him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He knows I’m after Horcruxes—he’s keeping Nagini close beside him—</p>
<p class="calibre1">obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing—</p>
<p class="calibre1">” “Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you can’t go, that’s what he wants, what he’s expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I’ll go and get it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry cut across Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Hermione,, “it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Hermione could get farther than “Ron, I’m just as capable—” the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“POTTER!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted “Glisseo!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Duro!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get back!” shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, “CHARGE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p544"></a>544</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 32. THE ELDER WAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you get the Cloak on,” said Hermione. “Never mind us—</p>
<p class="calibre1">” But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great “Wheeeeeeeeeeee!” and looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Argh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the damp green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean made the most of the Death Eater’s momentary distraction, knocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p545"></a>545</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight, you two—faced bastard!” Ron yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall. Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped won the marble staircase: glass shattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO!” shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters. “More for any who want them! Here—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with a move like a tennis serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the front hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Screams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p546"></a>546</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 32. THE ELDER WAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do we get out?” yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside; Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t hurt ’em, don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HAGRID, NO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HAGRID, COME BACK!” But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HAGRID!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care: He was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HAGRID!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh my—!” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HAGGER?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p547"></a>547</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp’s lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half brick—sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“come on, Harry!” said Hermione’s voice from a very long way away. “Patronuses, Harry, come on!” he raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about? He felt as though his soul had already half left his body. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HARRY, COME ON!” screamed Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry’s despair, which was like a promise of a feast. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw Ron’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione’s otter twist in midair and fade, and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p548"></a>548</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 32. THE ELDER WAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures’ approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A., “That’s right, Harry. . . come on think of something happy. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something happy¿‘ he said, his voice cracked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we;re still fighting. Come on, now. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of Harry’s wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t thank you enough,” said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus “you just saved—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“RUN!” Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They all scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment the creature’s vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round: Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished back into the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Whomping willow,” said Harry, “go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p549"></a>549</p>
<p class="calibre1">was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He sprinted, half—believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow’s swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath that she could not speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How—how’re we going to get in?” panted Ron. “I can—see the place—if we just had—Crookshanks again—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crookshanks?” wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. “Are you a wizard, or what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh—right—yeah—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wingardium Leviosa!” The twig flew up from the ground, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow’s ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect!” panted Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p550"></a>550</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 32. THE ELDER WAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tunnel was low—ceilinged: they had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. They moved in silence, Harry’s gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At last, the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, “Nox,” extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry’s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . my Lord, their resistance is crumbling—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—and it is doing so without your help,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. “Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there. . . almost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p551"></a>551</p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have a problem, Severus,” said Voldemort softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord?” said Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor’s baton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled—or was it Voldemort’s sibilant sigh lingering on the air? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My—my lord?” said Snape blankly. “I do not understand. You—you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Voldemort. “I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand. . . no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort’s tone was musing, calm, but Harry’s scar had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No difference,” said Voldemort again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure his master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have thought long and hard, Severus. . . do you know why I have called you back from battle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And for a moment Harry saw Snape’s profile. His eyes were fixed upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p552"></a>552</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 32. THE ELDER WAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">coiling snake in its enchanted cage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I knew his weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself—</p>
<p class="calibre1">” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends—the more, the better—but do not kill him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But—let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s impatience in his burning scar. “My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord, there can be no question, surely—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—but there is a question, Severus. There is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I cannot answer that, my Lord.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry’s head: he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape’s pale face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p553"></a>553</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another’s wand. I did so, but Lucius’s wand shattered upon meeting Potter’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I have no explanation, my Lord.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I sought a third wand, Severus. the Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s face was like a death mask. it was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord—let me go to the boy—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,” said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner. . . and I think I have the answer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape did not speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: but then Voldemort’s intention became clear. The snake’s cage was rolling through the air, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p554"></a>554</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 32. THE ELDER WAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape’s face losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes; He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape’s white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he cried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take. . . it. . . . Take. . . it. . . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p555"></a>555</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew what it was, but did not know what to do—</p>
<p class="calibre1">A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand by Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes slackened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look. . . at. . . me. . . . ” he whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p556"></a>556</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p557"></a><b class="calibre2">Chapter 33</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre2">The Prince’s Tale</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">HarryremainedkneelingatSnape’sside,simplystaringdownat him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, “valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not 557</p>

<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t listen to him,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly. “Let’s—let’s get back to the castle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new plan—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. . . One hour. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle (?). It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone dog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is everyone?” whispered Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other’s necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred’s body, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron’s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks. . . He yearned not to feel. . . He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Password?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p560"></a>560</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER 33. THE PRINCE’S TALE</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a blessed relief. . . Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mummy told you not to!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p561"></a>561</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I’m fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground. </p>
