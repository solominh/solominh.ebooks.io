<p class="calibre1">“Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly, smiling down at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid,” said Hermione in a rather small voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I surmised as much,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t you come in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh . . . um . . . okay,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry fended off Fang and looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 452 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p469"></a>RITA  SKEETER’S  SCOOP </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi, Hagrid,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Lo,” he said in a very hoarse voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More tea, I think,” said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat down. There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, “Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued, “Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course we still want to know you!” Harry said, staring at Hagrid. “You don’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry, Professor,” he added quickly, looking at Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea what you said, Harry,” said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — right,” said Harry sheepishly. “I just meant — Hagrid, how could you think we’d care what that — woman — wrote about you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling. “I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they would have something to say about it —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 453 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p470"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not all of ’em,” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Not all of ’em wan’ me ter stay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,” said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles. “Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven’t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh — yeh’re not half-giant!” said Hagrid croakily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid, look what I’ve got for relatives!” Harry said furiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at the Dursleys!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An excellent point,” said Professor Dumbledore. “My own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I’m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come back and teach, Hagrid,” said Hermione quietly, “please come back, we really miss you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore stood up. “I refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid, and I expect you back at work on Monday,” he said. “You will join me for breakfast at eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fang’s ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the door had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p471"></a>RITA  SKEETER’S  SCOOP </p>
<p class="calibre1">dustbin-lid-sized hands. Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, “Great man, Dumbledore . . . great man . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, he is,” said Ron. “Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help yerself,” said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. “Ar, he’s righ’, o’ course — yeh’re all righ’ . . . I bin stupid . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">my ol’ dad woulda bin ashamed o’ the way I’ve bin behavin’. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">More tears leaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully, and said, “Never shown you a picture of my old dad, have I? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with Hagrid’s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat on top of Hagrid’s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth — he looked hardly older than eleven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts,” Hagrid croaked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad was dead chuffed . . . thought I migh’ not be a wizard, see, </p>
<p class="calibre1">’cos me mum . . . well, anyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really . . . but at least he never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Got me the gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives ’em second chances . . . tha’s what sets him apar’ from other heads, see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’ll accept anyone at Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the talent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren’ . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">well . . . all tha’ respectable. But some don’ understand that. There’s some who’d always hold it against yeh . . . there’s some who’d even  </p>

<p class="calibre1">pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an’ say — I am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed. ‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">dad used ter say, ‘there’s some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re not worth botherin’ with.’ An’ he was right. I’ve bin an idiot. I’m not botherin’ with  <i class="calibre3">her</i> no more, I promise yeh that. Big bones . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll give her big bones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh know wha’, Harry?” he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, “when I firs’ met you, you reminded me o’ me a bit. Mum an’ Dad gone, an’ you was feelin’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">like yeh wouldn’ fit in at Hogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to it . . . an’ now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh know what I’d love, Harry? I’d love yeh ter win, I really would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’d show ’em all . . . yeh don’ have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don’ have ter be ashamed of what yeh are. It’d show ’em Dumbledore’s the one who’s got it righ’, lettin’ anyone in as long as they can do magic. How you doin’ with that egg, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,” said Harry. “Really great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tha’s my boy . . . you show ’em, Harry, you show ’em. Beat </p>
<p class="calibre1">’em all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lying to Hagrid wasn’t quite like lying to anyone else. Harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 456 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p473"></a>RITA  SKEETER’S  SCOOP </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning the tournament. The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on Harry’s conscience that evening, and by the time he had got into bed, he had made up his mind — it was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric’s hint was worth anything. </p>

<p class="calibre1">s Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work A out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reluctant  though  he  was  to  accept  more  favors  from  Cedric,  he also decided to use the prefects’ bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 458 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p475"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept out past him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because Harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other. However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn’t run into anyone he wanted to avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, “Pine fresh,” just as Cedric had told him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pool’s edges, each with a differently colored jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a single golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 459 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p476"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she snored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls. Magnificent though the bathroom was — and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps — now he was here he couldn’t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been having him on. How on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn’t bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it. One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he’d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water. Harry amused himself for a while turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of bril iance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 460 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p477"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn’t been Cedric’s plan — and then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d try putting it  <i class="calibre3">in</i> the water, if I were you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three floors below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not wearing anything!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said, blinking at him through her thick spectacles. “You haven’t been to see me for  <i class="calibre3">ages. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah . . . well . . .” said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t see anything but his head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? It’s a girls’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You didn’t used to care,” said Myrtle miserably. “You used to be in there all the time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 461 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p478"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polyjuice Potion in secret — a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got told off for going in there,” said Harry, which was half-true; Percy had once caught him coming out of Myrtle’s bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought I’d better not come back after that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh . . . I see . . .” said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way. “Well. . . anyway . . . I’d try the egg in the water. That’s what Cedric Diggory did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you been spying on him too?” said Harry indignantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes,” said Myrtle, rather slyly, “but I’ve never come out to speak to anyone before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m honored,” said Harry darkly. “You keep your eyes shut!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoist-ing himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve the egg. Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, “Go on, then . . . open it under the water!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it . . . and this time, it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose words he couldn’t distinguish through the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You need to put your head under too,” said Myrtle, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around. “Go on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took a great breath and slid under the surface — and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands: </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 462 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p479"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Come seek us where our voices sound, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">We cannot sing above the ground, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And while you’re searching ponder this:</i> <i class="calibre3">We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">An hour long you’ll have to look, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And to recover what we took, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">But past an hour — the prospect’s black,</i> <i class="calibre3">Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hear it?” said Myrtle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah . . . ‘Come seek us where our voices sound . . .’ and if I need persuading . . . hang on, I need to listen again. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater renditions of the egg’s song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slow, aren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 463 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p480"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">talking to himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had gone. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake, apart from the giant squid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don’t have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet, Harry said, “Well, does anything in there have a human voice? Hang on —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Myrtle, there aren’t  <i class="calibre3">merpeople</i> in there, are there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oooh, very good,” she said, her thick glasses twinkling, “it took Diggory much longer than that! And that was with  <i class="calibre3">her</i> awake too” — Myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face — “giggling and showing off and flashing her fins. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s it, isn’t it?” said Harry excitedly. “The second task’s to go and find the merpeople in the lake and . . . and . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pul ed a plug in his stomach. He wasn’t a very good swimmer; he’d never had much practice. Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to give him any. A couple of lengths of this bath were all very well, but that lake was very large, and very deep . . . and merpeople would surely live right at the bottom. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 464 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p481"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Myrtle,” Harry said slowly, “how am I supposed to  <i class="calibre3">breathe</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this, Myrtle’s eyes filled with sudden tears again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tactless!” she muttered, groping in her robes for a handkerchief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s tactless?” said Harry, bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talking about breathing in front of  <i class="calibre3">me</i>!” she said shrilly, and her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom. “When I can’t . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">when I haven’t . . . not for ages . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry remembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,” he said impatiently. “I didn’t mean — I just forgot . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle’s dead,” said Myrtle, gulping, looking at him out of swollen eyes. “Nobody missed me even when I was alive. Took them hours and hours to find my body — I know, I was sitting there waiting for them. Olive Hornby came into the bathroom — ‘Are you in here again, sulking, Myrtle?’ she said, ‘because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you —’ And then she saw my body . . . ooooh, she didn’t forget it until her dying day, I made sure of that . . . followed her around and reminded her, I did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember at her brother’s wedding —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry wasn’t listening; he was thinking about the merpeople’s song again. “<i class="calibre3">We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss. </i>” That sounded as though they were going to steal something of his, something he had to get back. What were they going to take? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking her, so I had to  come  back  here  and  live  in  my toilet.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Good,” said Harry vaguely. “Well, I’m a lot further on than I was. . . . Shut your eyes again, will you? I’m getting out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried himself, and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er . . . I’ll try,” Harry said, though privately thinking the only way he’d be visiting Myrtle’s bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked. “See you, Myrtle . . . thanks for your help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Bye, ’bye,” she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibility Cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauder’s Map to check that the coast was still clear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office . . . nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above. . . . Harry had taken his first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught his eye . . . something distinctly odd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peeves was  <i class="calibre3">not</i> the only thing that was moving. A single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner — Snape’s office. But the dot wasn’t labeled “Severus Snape” . . . it was Bartemius Crouch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the Yule Bal  — so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one o’clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room, pausing here and there. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 466 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p483"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got the better of him. He turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase. He was going to see what Crouch was up to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his pajamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him down two floors. He kept glancing down at the map, wondering . . . It just didn’t seem in character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr. Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else’s office this late at night. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch, Harry’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped — Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn’t reach it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach — </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling the cloak back over himself Harry straightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fear . . . and, almost immediately — </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 467 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p484"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“PEEVES!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I’ll have you, Peeves, I’ll have you, you’ll . . . and what is this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch’s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped — Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stood very still, one leg still jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any moment now, Filch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would be no Peeves . . . but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder’s Map . . . and Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show “Harry Potter” standing exactly where he was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Egg?” Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. “My sweet!” — </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs. Norris was obviously with him — “This is a Triwizard clue! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This belongs to a school champion!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“PEEVES!” Filch roared gleefully. “You’ve been stealing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hiding, are you?” he said softly. “I’m coming to get you, Peeves. . . . You’ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore’ll have you out of here for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-colored cat at his heels. Mrs. Norris’s lamp-like eyes, so very like her master’s, </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 468 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p485"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">were fixed directly upon Harry. He had had occasion before now to wonder whether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats. . . . Sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown — he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches — any second now, Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Filch? What’s going on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry’s situation worse: Snape. He was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Peeves, Professor,” Filch whispered malevolently. “He threw this egg down the stairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peeves?” said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch’s hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Peeves couldn’t get into my office. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This egg was in your office, Professor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course not,” Snape snapped. “I heard banging and wailing —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Professor, that was the egg —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— I was coming to investigate —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— Peeves threw it, Professor —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Peeves couldn’t —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know he couldn’t, Filch!” Snape snapped again. “I seal my office  </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p486"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">with a spell none but a wizard could break!” Snape looked up the stairs, straight through Harry, and then down into the corridor below. “I want you to come and help me search for the intruder, Filch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I — yes, Professor — but —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves.  <i class="calibre3">Go, </i> Harry pleaded with him silently,  <i class="calibre3">go with Snape</i> . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">go</i> . . . Mrs. Norris was peering around Filch’s legs. . . . Harry had the distinct impression that she could smell him. . . . Why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The thing is, Professor,” said Filch plaintively, “the headmaster will have to listen to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Filch, I don’t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it’s my office that’s —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pajama party, is it?” he growled up the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,” said Filch at once. “Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual — </p>
<p class="calibre1">and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut up!” Snape hissed to Filch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 470 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p487"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moody’s magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt.  <i class="calibre3">Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks</i> . . . he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody’s lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other’s eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did I hear that correctly, Snape?” he asked slowly. “Someone broke into your office?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is unimportant,” said Snape coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the contrary,” growled Moody, “it is very important. Who’d want to break into your office?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A student, I daresay,” said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape’s greasy temple. “It has happened before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard . . . students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?” said Moody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not hiding anything else in your office, are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw the edge of Snape’s sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know I’m hiding nothing, Moody,” he said in a soft and dangerous voice, “as you’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody’s face twisted into a smile. “Auror’s privilege, Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore told me to keep an eye —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 471 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p488"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore happens to trust me,” said Snape through clenched teeth. “I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Course Dumbledore trusts you,” growled Moody. “He’s a trusting man, isn’t he? Believes in second chances. But me — I say there are spots that don’t come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d’you know what I mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody laughed. “Get back to bed, Snape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!” Snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself. “I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prowl away,” said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. “I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve dropped something, by the way. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a stab of horror, Harry saw Moody point at the Marauder’s Map, still lying on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract his attention, mouthing “It’s mine!  <i class="calibre3">Mine</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on his face — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Accio Parchment</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape’s outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into Moody’s hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My mistake,” Moody said calmly. “It’s mine — must’ve dropped it earlier —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 472 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p489"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Snape’s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as only Snape could. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter,” he said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs; Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff Harry out — trapped, Harry leaned backward, trying to avoid Snape’s fingertips, but any moment now — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s nothing there, Snape!” barked Moody, “but I’ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meaning what?” Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still outstretched, inches from Harry’s chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meaning that Dumbledore’s very interested to know who’s got it in for that boy!” said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs. “And so am I, Snape . . . very interested. . . .” The torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn’t see the expression on his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape slowly lowered his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 473 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p490"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I merely thought,” said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, “that if Potter was wandering around after hours again . . . it’s an unfortunate habit of his . . . he should be stopped. For — for his own safety.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, I see,” said Moody softly. “Got Potter’s best interests at heart, have you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each other. Mrs. Norris gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch’s legs, looking for the source of Harry’s bubble-bath smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think I will go back to bed,” Snape said curtly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Best idea you’ve had all night,” said Moody. “Now, Filch, if you’ll just give me that egg —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his first-born son. “Professor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves’ treachery!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the property of the champion he stole it from,” said Moody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hand it over, now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very fast, Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris. “Never mind, my sweet . . . we’ll see Dumbledore in the morning . . . tell him what Peeves was up to. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb labo-riously toward him, a dull  <i class="calibre3">clunk</i> on every other step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 474 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p491"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauders Map out of his pocket and unfolding it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the pain. “Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you could help me — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter . . .” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance, to see who broke into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er . . . yeah, I did . . .” Harry admitted. “It was Mr. Crouch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked suddenly alarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crouch?” he said. “You’re — you’re sure, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Positive,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, he’s not here anymore,” said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map. “Crouch . . . that’s very — very interesting. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could tell that this news meant something to Moody and very much wanted to know what it was. He wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him slightly . . . yet Moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 475 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p492"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er . . . Professor Moody . . . why d’you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snape’s office?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody’s magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put it this way, Potter,” Moody muttered finally, “they say old Mad-Eye’s obsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I’m nothing —  <i class="calibre3">nothing</i> — compared to Barty Crouch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Moody?” he said again. “D’you think . . . could this have anything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there’s something going on. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like what?” said Moody sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn’t want Moody to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” Harry muttered, “odd stuff’s been happening lately, hasn’t it? It’s been in the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> . . . the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re a sharp boy, Potter,” he said. His magical eye roved back to the Marauder’s Map. “Crouch could be thinking along those lines,” he said slowly. “Very possible . . . there have been some funny rumors flying around lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It’s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.” A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. “Oh if there’s one thing I hate,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he muttered, more to himself than to Harry, and his magical eye </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 476 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p493"></a>THE  EGG  AND  THE  EYE </p>
<p class="calibre1">was fixed on the left-hand corner of the map, “it’s a Death Eater who walked free. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he meant? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And now I want to ask  <i class="calibre3">you</i> a question, Potter,” said Moody in a more businesslike tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object — and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who braced himself — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can I borrow this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn’t asking where he’d got it, and there was no doubt that he owed Moody a favor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good boy,” growled Moody. “I can make good use of this . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">this might be  <i class="calibre3">exactly</i> what I’ve been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before. They walked in silence to the door of Moody’s office, where he stopped and looked up at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You want to consider it,” said Moody, nodding and looking </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 477 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p494"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">at Harry thoughtfully. “Yes, indeed . . . and incidentally . . . I’m guessing you weren’t just taking that egg for a walk tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — no,” said Harry, grinning. “I’ve been working out the clue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . . . See you in the morning. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He went back into his office, staring down at the Marauder’s Map again, and closed the door behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant. . . . Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Moody thought he, Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea . . . but somehow, Harry thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later, the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he’d like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Keep your voice down!” said Harry crossly. “I just need to — </p>
<p class="calibre1">sort of fine-tune it, all right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today — the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that these wouldn’t hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn’t working very well. Neville’s aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room — Professor Flitwick, for instance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?” Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p496"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">of a large cabinet. “I’m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape said Moody’s searched his office as well?” Ron whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati’s hat off). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What . . . d’you reckon Moody’s here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I dunno if that’s what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he’s definitely doing it,” said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk. “Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he’s giving him a second chance or something. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick’s desk. “Harry . . . maybe Moody thinks <i class="calibre3">Snape</i> put your name in the Goblet of Fire!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh Ron,” said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, “we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry’s life, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking . . . it was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as he’d loathed Harry’s father when they had been at school together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 480 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p497"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t care what Moody says,” Hermione went on. “Dumbledore’s not stupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn’t have given them jobs, so why shouldn’t he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— evil,” said Ron promptly. “Come on, Hermione, why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?” said Hermione, ignoring Ron. “It’s a bit funny, isn’t it, that he can’t manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You just don’t like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,” said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">You</i> just want to think Snape’s up to something,” said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he’s on his second one,” said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Obedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape’s office, and Moody and Snape’s conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — Harry had explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn’t </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 481 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p498"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">see why Harry shouldn’t Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was too  much  to  hope  that  no  Muggles  would  spot  an  Aqua-Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we’d done human Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he might do it for me. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,” said Hermione seriously. “No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends — though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 482 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p499"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  as  it  had  before  he  faced  the Horntail, time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go before February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) . . . there were five days to go (he was bound to find something soon) . . . three days to go ( <i class="calibre3">please let me find</i> <i class="calibre3">something</i> . . .  <i class="calibre3">please</i>) . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">With two days left, Harry started to go off food again. The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Send date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see something else, but it was blank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weekend after next,” whispered Hermione, who had read the note over Harry’s shoulder. “Here — take my quill and send this owl back straight away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius’s letter, tied it onto the brown owl’s leg, and watched it take flight again. What had he expected? Advice on how to survive underwater? He had been so intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody he had completely forgotten to mention the egg’s clue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 483 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p500"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno,” said Harry dully. The momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died. “Come on . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Care of Magical Creatures.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could, Harry didn’t know, but Hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d returned to work. It turned out that Hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals. Unlike full-grown unicorns, they were pure gold. Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easier ter spot than the adults,” Hagrid told the class. “They turn silver when they’re abou’ two years old, an’ they grow horns at aroun’ four. Don’ go pure white till they’re full grown, ’round about seven. They’re a bit more trustin’ when they’re babies . . . don’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">mind boys so much. . . . C’mon, move in a bit, yeh can pat ’em if yeh want . . . give ’em a few o’ these sugar lumps. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You okay, Harry?” Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jus’ nervous, eh?” said Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bit,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 484 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p501"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">so that Harry’s knees buckled under its weight, “I’d’ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha’ Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin’ yeh set yer mind ter. I’m not worried at all. Yeh’re goin’ ter be fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven’ yeh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess that he didn’t have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him. He looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it? He looked after everything else on the grounds, after all — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” Hagrid growled, patting Harry’s shoulder again, so that Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground. “I know it. I can feel it.  <i class="calibre3">Yeh’re goin’ ter win,</i> <i class="calibre3">Harry. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off Hagrid’s face. Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in return, and moved forward to pat them with the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">By the evening before the second task, Harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle,  he  managed  to  find  a  suitable  spel ,  he’d  have  a  real  job mastering it overnight. How could he have let this happen? Why hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner? Why had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 485 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p502"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">of each of them. Harry’s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word “water” on a page, but more often than not it was merely </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the other side of the table. “There’s nothing.  <i class="calibre3">Nothing. </i> Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There must be something,” Hermione muttered, moving a candle closer to her. Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of  <i class="calibre3">Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes</i> with her nose about an inch from the page. “They’d never have set a task that was undoable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They have,” said Ron. “Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they’ve nicked, and see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a way of doing it!” Hermione said crossly. “There just has to be!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She seemed to be taking the library’s lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult; it had never failed her before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know what I should have done,” said Harry, resting, facedown, on  <i class="calibre3">Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts. </i> “I should’ve learned to be an Animagus like Sirius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, you could’ve turned into a goldfish any time you wanted!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or a frog,” yawned Harry. He was exhausted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you have to </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p503"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">register yourself and everything,” said Hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of  <i class="calibre3">Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their</i> <i class="calibre3">Solutions. </i> “Professor McGonagall told us, remember . . . you’ve got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">what animal you become, and your markings, so you can’t abuse it. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, I was joking,” said Harry wearily. “I know I haven’t got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh this is no use,” Hermione said, snapping shut  <i class="calibre3">Weird Wizarding Dilemmas. </i> “Who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  wouldn’t  mind,”  said  Fred  Weasley’s voice. “Be a talking point, wouldn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and George had just emerged from behind some bookshelves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’re you two doing here?” Ron asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looking for you,” said George. “McGonagall wants you, Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And you, Hermione.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” said Hermione, looking surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno . . . she was looking a bit grim, though,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re supposed to take you down to her office,” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his stomach drop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was Professor McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps she’d noticed how much they were helping him, when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll meet you back in the common room,” Hermione told Harry as she got up to go with Ron — both of them looked very anxious. “Bring as many of these books as you can, okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry uneasily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 487 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p504"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">By eight o’clock, Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy Harry out of the library. Staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to search. There was nothing in  <i class="calibre3">Madcap Magic for Wacky</i> <i class="calibre3">Warlocks</i> . . . nothing in  <i class="calibre3">A Guide to Medieval Sorcery</i> . . . not one mention of underwater exploits in  <i class="calibre3">An Anthology of Eighteenth-Century Charms</i>, or in  <i class="calibre3">Dreadful Denizens of the Deep</i>, or  <i class="calibre3">Powers</i> <i class="calibre3">You Never Knew You Had and What to Do with Them Now You’ve</i> <i class="calibre3">Wised Up. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookshanks crawled into Harry’s lap and curled up, purring deeply. The common room emptied slowly around Harry. People kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid’s, all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task. Harry couldn’t answer them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat. By ten to midnight, he was alone in the room with Crookshanks. He had searched all the remaining books, and Ron and Hermione had not come back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s over, he told himself. You can’t do it. You’ll just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He imagined himself explaining that he couldn’t do the task. He pictured Bagman’s look of round-eyed surprise, Karkaroff’s satisfied, yellow-toothed smile. He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying “<i class="calibre3">I knew it</i> . . . ’ <i class="calibre3">e is too young, ’e is only a little boy. </i>” He saw Malfoy flashing his  <i class="calibre3">POTTER STINKS</i> badge at the front of the crowd, saw Hagrid’s crestfallen, disbelieving face. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap, Harry stood up </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p505"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily  as  he  landed  on  the floor, gave Harry a disgusted look, and stalked away with his bot-tlebrush tail in the air, but Harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory. . . . He would grab the Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library, he’d stay there all night if he had to. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Lumos, </i>” Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves, pulling down more books — books of hexes and charms, books on merpeople and water monsters, books on famous witches and wizards, on magical inventions, on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival. He carried them over to a table, then set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of his wand, occasionally checking his watch. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">One in the morning . . . two in the morning . . . the only way he could keep going was to tell himself, over and over again,  <i class="calibre3">next</i> <i class="calibre3">book</i> . . .  <i class="calibre3">in the next one</i> . . .  <i class="calibre3">the next one</i> . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">The mermaid in the painting in the prefects’ bathroom was laughing. Harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held his Firebolt over his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come and get it!” she giggled maliciously. “Come on, jump!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t,” Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and struggling not to sink. “Give it to me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick, laughing at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That hurts — get off — ouch —” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Stop poking me —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry opened his eyes. He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he’d slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of  <i class="calibre3">Where There’s a Wand, There’s a Way. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sat up, straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright daylight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter needs to hurry!” squeaked Dobby. “The second task starts in ten minutes, and Harry Potter —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten minutes?” Harry croaked. “Ten —  <i class="calibre3">ten minutes</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked down at his watch. Dobby was right. It was twenty past nine. A large, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry’s chest into his stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurry, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry’s sleeve. “You is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s too late, Dobby,” Harry said hopelessly. “I’m not doing the task, I don’t know how —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter  <i class="calibre3">will</i> do the task!” squeaked the elf. “Dobby knew Harry had not found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry. “But  <i class="calibre3">you</i> don’t know what the second task is —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Find my what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s a Wheezy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy — Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater!” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What</i>?” Harry gasped. “They’ve got . . . they’ve got  <i class="calibre3">Ron</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked Dobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘ <i class="calibre3">But past an hour</i> —’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— ‘ <i class="calibre3">the prospect’s black, </i>’ ” Harry recited, staring, horror-struck, at the elf. “ ‘ <i class="calibre3">Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back</i>.’ Dobby — what’ve I got to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You has to eat this, sir!” squeaked the elf, and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy, grayish-green rat tails. “Right before you go into the lake, sir — gillyweed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s it do?” said Harry, staring at the gillyweed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby,” said Harry frantically, “listen — are you sure about this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to </p>
<p class="calibre1">“help” him, he had ended up with no bones in his right arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby is quite sure, sir!” said the elf earnestly. “Dobby hears things, sir, he is a house-elf, he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors. Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed  </p>

<p class="calibre1">as they burst into the corridor. “Dobby will be missed — good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The entrance hall contained a few last-minute stragglers, all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task. They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons’ enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below. The excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran flat-out around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were sitting at another gold-draped table at the water’s edge. Cedric, Fleur, and Krum were beside the judges’ table, watching Harry sprint toward them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m . . . here . . .” Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering Fleur’s robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where have you been?” said a bossy, disapproving voice. “The task’s about to start!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">table — Mr. Crouch had failed to turn up again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, now, Percy!” said Ludo Bagman, who was looking intensely relieved to see Harry. “Let him catch his breath!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn’t look at all pleased to see him. . . . It was obvious  </p>

<p class="calibre1">from the looks on their faces that they had thought he wasn’t going to turn up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath; he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs, but there was no time to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of the line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, Harry?” Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther away from Krum. “Know what you’re going to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” Harry panted, massaging his ribs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bagman gave Harry’s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges’ table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said, “<i class="calibre3">Sonorus</i>!” and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which wil   start  on  my  whistle.  They  have  precisely  an  hour  to  recover what has been taken from them. On the count of three, then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One . . . two . . .  <i class="calibre3">three</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands erupted with cheers and applause; without looking to see what the other champions were doing, Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire, not icy water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the water was over his knees, and his rapidly  </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p510"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones. He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist-deep in the freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power. The part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck — </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears, flapping in the cold air.  <i class="calibre3">. . . He had gills. </i> Without pausing to think, he did the only thing that made sense — he flung himself forward into the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet — they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he had sprouted flippers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The water didn’t feel icy anymore either . . . on the contrary, he </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 494 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p511"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">felt pleasantly cool and very light. . . . Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape. He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the shadows beyond, where the water became opaque. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Small fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron — nor, thankfully, the giant squid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom . . . and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry’s leg, its pointed fangs bared — </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 495 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p512"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry’s robes, and were attempting to drag him down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Relashio</i>!” Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. . . . A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back inside his robes, and looked around, listening again. He turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are you getting on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought he was having a heart attack. He whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick, pearly glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Myrtle!” Harry tried to shout — but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You want to try over there!” she said, pointing. “I won’t come  </p>

<p class="calibre1">with you. . . . I don’t like them much, they always chase me when I get too close. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks and set off once more, careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. He was passing over vast expanses of black mud now, which swirled murk-ily as he disturbed the water. Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">An hour long you’ll have to look, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And to recover what we took</i> . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam on past the rock, following the mersong. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“. . .  <i class="calibre3">your time’s half gone, so tarry not</i> <i class="calibre3">Lest what you seek stays here to rot</i>. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides. Here and there at the dark windows, Harry saw faces . . . faces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects’ bathroom. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark green hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their eyes were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks. They leered at Harry as  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 497 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p514"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">he swam past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in their hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous; there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a mer-version of a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour’s sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep. Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong. For a fleeting second he thought of the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas — locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 498 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p515"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">were carrying spears. He swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear. The merman laughed and shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We do not help,” he said in a harsh, croaky voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come  <i class="calibre3">ON </i>!” Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp . . . anything . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron, and after several minutes’ hard work, they broke apart. Ron floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions. What were they playing at? Why didn’t they hurry up? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned back to Hermione, raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her bindings too — </p>
<p class="calibre1">At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him. Half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads, and laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You take your own hostage,” one of them said to him. “Leave the others . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No way!” said Harry furiously — but only two large bubbles came out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the others . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">She’s</i> my friend too!” Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione, </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 499 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p516"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips. “And I don’t want  <i class="calibre3">them</i> to die either!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cho’s head was on Hermione’s shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale. Harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding him back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked wildly around. Where were the other champions? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would  he  have  time  to  take  Ron to the surface and come back down for Hermione and the others? Would he be able to find them again? He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left — it had stopped working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head. Harry looked up and saw Cedric swimming toward them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got lost!” he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. “Fleur and Krum’re coming now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free. He pulled her upward and out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and Krum? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time was getting short, and according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an hour. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those holding Harry loosened their grip, staring behind them. Harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them: a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. . . . It was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured himself — but badly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that Krum’s new teeth were </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p517"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dol-phin, and Harry was quite sure that if Krum wasn’t careful, he was going to rip Hermione in half. Darting forward, Harry hit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone. Krum seized it and began to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Now what</i>? Harry thought desperately. If he could be sure that Fleur was coming. . . . But still no sign. There was nothing to be done except . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the mermen now closed in around Ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him. Harry pulled out his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get out of the way!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing. Their yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry’s wand, and they looked scared. There might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got until three!” Harry shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from him, but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message. “One . . .” (he put down a finger) “two . . .” (he put down a second one) — </p>
<p class="calibre1">They scattered. Harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue, and at last she was free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron’s robes, and kicked off from the bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 501 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p518"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was very slow work. He could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forward; he worked his flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur’s sister were like potato-filled sacks dragging him back down. . . . He fixed his eyes skyward, though he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was so dark. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merpeople were rising with him. He could see them swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water. . . . Would they pul  him back down to the depths when the time was up? Did they perhaps eat humans? Harry’s legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and the girl. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He could feel pain on the sides of his neck again . . . he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouth . . . yet the darkness was definitely thinning now . . . he could see daylight above him. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet . . . water was flooding through his mouth into his lungs . . . he was starting to feel dizzy, but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him . . . he had to get there . . . he had to . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest; his very brain felt waterlogged, he couldn’t breathe, he needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not stop — </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he felt his head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he had never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled Ron and the little girl up with him. All around him, </p>

<p class="calibre1">wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of the water with him, but they were smiling at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; Harry had the impression they thought that Ron and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong . . . both of them had opened their eyes; the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to Harry, and said, “Wet, this, isn’t it?” Then he spotted Fleur’s sister. “What did you bring her for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fleur didn’t turn up, I couldn’t leave her,” Harry panted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you prat,” said Ron, “you didn’t take that song thing seriously, did you? Dumbledore wouldn’t have let any of us drown!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The song said —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron. “I hope you didn’t waste time down there acting the hero!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very well for Ron; <i class="calibre3">he’d</i> been asleep, he hadn’t felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear-carrying merpeople who’d looked more than capable of murder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon,” Harry said shortly, “help me with her, I don’t think she can swim very well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They pulled Fleur’s sister through the water, back toward the bank where the judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor, singing their horrible screechy songs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum, Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 503 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p520"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail to return to the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gabrielle!  <i class="calibre3">Gabrielle</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Is she alive</i>?  <i class="calibre3">Is she ’urt</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s fine!” Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank (“Ger-roff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was ze grindylows . . . zey attacked me . . . oh Gabrielle, I thought . . . I thought . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come here, you,” said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried. “You did it, you found out how all by yourself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well —” said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back safely. “Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny,” said </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 504 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p521"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum. Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time limit, though, Harry. . . . Did it take you ages to find us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No . . . I found you okay. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledore’s safety precautions wouldn’t have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn’t turned up. Why hadn’t he just grabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first back. . . . Cedric and Krum hadn’t wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn’t taken the mersong seriously. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore was crouching at the water’s edge, deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking female. He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish. Finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said, “A conference before we give the marks, I think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from Percy’s clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn’t seem to care, nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she turned to Harry. “You saved ’er,” she said breathlessly. “Even though she was not your ’ostage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 505 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p522"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he’d left all three girls tied to the statue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and wouldn’t have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again),  then  said  to  Ron,  “And  you  too  —  you </p>
<p class="calibre1">’elped —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a bit —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. Hermione looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision. Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as follows. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble-Head Charm, was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to retrieve her hostage. We award her twenty-five points.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Applause from the stands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I deserved zero,” said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We therefore award him forty-seven points.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p523"></a>THE  SECOND  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Viktor  Krum  used  an  incomplete  form  of  Transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award him forty points.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect,” Bagman continued. “He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated, half-commiserating looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most of the judges,” and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look, “feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However . . . Mr. Potter’s score is forty-five points.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s stomach leapt — he was now tying for first place with <i class="calibre3">Cedric. </i> Ron and Hermione, caught by surprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There you go, Harry!” Ron shouted over the noise. “You weren’t being thick after all — you were showing moral fiber!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn’t look happy at all. He attempted to engage Hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering Harry to listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June,” continued Bagman. “The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand. Thank you all for your support of the champions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was over, Harry thought dazedly, as Madam Pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into </p>

<p class="calibre1">ne of the best things about the aftermath of the second task O was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry’s limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron’s version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione’s story, anyway — Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall’s office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,” he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him </p>

There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius’s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s gang of Slytherin girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of them were looking at something Harry couldn’t see and sniggering heartily. Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle’s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There they are, there they are!” she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands —  <i class="calibre3">Witch Weekly</i>. The moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside. </p>

Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk.

<p class="calibre1">Little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toy-ing with both boys’ affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has “never felt this way about any other girl.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys’ interest. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I think that’s how she’s doing it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Scarlet woman</i>?” she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his ears going red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If that’s the best Rita can do, she’s losing her touch,” said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw  <i class="calibre3">Witch Weekly</i> onto the empty chair beside her. “What a pile of old rubbish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he  <i class="calibre3">did</i> say he’d never felt the same way about anyone else,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, “but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn’t there . . . or was she?

<p class="calibre1">The dungeon rang with the Slytherins’ laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape’s thin mouth. To Harry’s fury, he began to read the article aloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘ <i class="calibre3">Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache</i> . . . dear, dear, Potter, what’s ailing you now? ‘ <i class="calibre3">A boy like no other, perhaps</i> . . .’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘. . .  <i class="calibre3">Harry Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate. </i>’ How very touching,” </p>

Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter — that table in front of my desk. Move. Now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry un-load his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have Snape’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head, Potter,” said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), “but I don’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me, Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn’t hear what Snape was saying to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” Snape continued in a softer and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my office one more time —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said Harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t lie to me,” Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harry’s. “Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know who stole them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn’t stolen either of these things from Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year — they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry lied coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape hissed. “I know it, Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! </p>

<p class="calibre1">One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. “I’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one wild moment, Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him — then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,” said Snape viciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand  <i class="calibre3">slips</i>” — he shook the crystal bottle slightly — “right over your evening pumpkin juice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, Potter . . . then we’ll find out whether you’ve been in my office or not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn’t like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it . . . quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble — Hermione and Dobby for a start — there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">There was a knock on the dungeon door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enter,” said Snape in his usual voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in. Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape’s desk. He was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to talk,” said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” Snape muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to talk now, while you can’t slip off, Severus. You’ve been avoiding me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After the lesson,” Snape snapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he’d poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karkaroff hovered behind Snape’s desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck  </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What’s so urgent?” he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">This</i>,” said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left-hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. “Do you see? It’s never been this clear, never since —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put it away!” snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you must have noticed —” Karkaroff began in an agitated voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can talk later, Karkaroff!” spat Snape. “Potter! What are you doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,” said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Sirius,” said Harry when they had reached him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black dog sniffed Harry’s bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself. </p>

<p class="calibre1">path, following Sirius’s wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry’s bag cutting into his shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak’s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very thin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chicken!” he said hoarsely after removing the old  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophets</i> from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,” said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been living off rats mostly. Can’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harry’s face, said more seriously, “I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let’s just say things are getting fishier. I’ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I’m not the only one who’s getting worried.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He nodded at the yellowing  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophets</i> on the cave floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius. </p>

<p class="calibre1">stared at Sirius. “Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s possible,” said Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winky didn’t steal that wand!” Hermione insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The elf wasn’t the only one in that box,” said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace. “Who else was sitting behind you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Loads of people,” said Harry. “Some Bulgarian ministers . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cornelius Fudge . . . the Malfoys . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Malfoys!” said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. “I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyone else?” said Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,” Hermione reminded him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,” said Sirius, still pacing. “What’s he like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s okay,” said Harry. “He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does he, now?” said Sirius, frowning more deeply. “I wonder why he’d do that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Says he’s taken a liking to me,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm,” said Sirius, looking thoughtful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione told Sirius. “Remember?” she said to Harry and Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 524 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p541"></a>PADFOOT  RETURNS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but he didn’t stay in the forest, did he?” said Ron. “The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How d’you know?” Hermione shot back. “How d’you know where he Disapparated to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come off it,” said Ron incredulously. “Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s more likely he did it than Winky,” said Hermione stubbornly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Told you,” said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, “told you she’s obsessed with house —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry’s wand, what did Crouch do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Went to look in the bushes,” said Harry, “but there wasn’t anyone else there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, “of course, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf . . . and then he sacked her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Hermione in a heated voice, “he sacked her, just because she hadn’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius shook his head and said, “She’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All these absences of Barty Crouch’s . . . he goes to the trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn’t bother to turn up and watch. He works  </p>

<p class="calibre1">very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It’s not like Crouch. If he’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat Buckbeak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you know Crouch, then?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius’s face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What</i>?” said Ron and Hermione together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re kidding!” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m not,” said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law En-forcement, didn’t you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical — and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,” he said, reading the look on Harry’s face. “No, Barty Crouch was always very out-spoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn’t understand . . . you’re too young. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s what my dad said at the World Cup,” said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. “Try us, why don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A grin flashed across Sirius’s thin face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, I’ll try you. . . .” He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, “Imagine that Voldemort’s powerful now. You don’t know who his supporters are, you don’t know who’s working </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p543"></a>PADFOOT  RETURNS </p>
<p class="calibre1">for him and who isn’t; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You’re scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic’s in disarray, they don’t know what to do, they’re trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">panic . . . confusion . . . that’s how it used to be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch’s principles might’ve been good in the be-ginning — I wouldn’t know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort’s supporters. The Aurors were given new powers — powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn’t the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you — </p>
<p class="calibre1">plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. . . .” Sirius smiled grimly. “Crouch’s own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who’d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crouch’s  <i class="calibre3">son</i> was caught?” gasped Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,” said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 527 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p544"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">and tearing it in half. “Nasty little shock for old Barty, I’d imagine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn’t he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">gotten to know his own son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He began to wolf down large pieces of bread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Was</i> his son a Death Eater?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No idea,” said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. “I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I’ve found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I’d bet my life were Death Eaters — but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again — doesn’t that tell you what he’s like? Crouch’s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn’t much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He gave his own son to the dementors?” asked Harry quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” said Sirius, and he didn’t look remotely amused now. “I saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can’t have been more than nineteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 528 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p545"></a>PADFOOT  RETURNS </p>
<p class="calibre1">they all went quiet in the end . . . except when they shrieked in their sleep. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius’s eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So he’s still in Azkaban?” Harry said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Sirius dully. “No, he’s not in there anymore. He died about a year after they brought him in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  <i class="calibre3">died</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He wasn’t the only one,” said Sirius bitterly. “Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch never came for his son’s body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic . . . next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I’ve heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared </p>

<p class="calibre1">� 529 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p546"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">much  for  him.  So  Cornelius  Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch’s eyes had bulged as he’d looked down at his disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry told Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I’ve heard it’s become a bit of a mania with him,” said Sirius, nodding. “If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he sneaked up here to search Snape’s office!” said Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, and that doesn’t make sense at all,” said Sirius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, it does!” said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn’t he been coming to judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you think Snape could be up to something, then?” asked Harry, but Hermione broke in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh give it a rest, Hermione,” said Ron impatiently. “I know Dumbledore’s brilliant and everything, but that doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool him —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did Snape save Harry’s life in the first year, then? Why didn’t he just let him die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 530 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p547"></a>PADFOOT  RETURNS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you think, Sirius?” Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think they’ve both got a point,” said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. “Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I’ve wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape’s always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,” Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. “Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges — they’re a married couple — </p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re in Azkaban. Avery — from what I’ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he’d been acting under the Imperius Curse — he’s still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater — not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape’s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, you should’ve seen Snape’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!” said Harry quickly. “Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape’s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn’t see what it was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He showed Snape something on his arm?” said Sirius, looking </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 531 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p548"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. “Wel ,  I’ve  no  idea  what  that’s about . . . but if Karkaroff’s genuinely worried, and he’s going to Snape for answers . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn’t, but I just can’t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he’d ever worked for Voldemort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape’s office then?” said Ron stubbornly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Sirius slowly, “I wouldn’t put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher’s office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I’m not sure  <i class="calibre3">he</i> trusts anyone at all, and after the things he’s seen, it’s not surprising. I’ll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he’s a different matter . . . is he real y il ? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape’s office? And if he’s not . . . what’s he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn’t turn up in the Top Box? What’s he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You say your brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he’s seen Crouch lately?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 532 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p549"></a>PADFOOT  RETURNS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can try,” said Ron doubtfully. “Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up  to  anything  dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you might try and find out whether they’ve got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you’re at it,” said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bagman told me they hadn’t,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, he’s quoted in the article in there,” said Sirius, nodding at the paper. “Blustering on about how bad Bertha’s memory is. Well, maybe she’s changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn’t forgetful at all — quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that’s why Bagman didn’t bother to look for her for so long. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn’t been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s half past three,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d better get back to school,” Sirius said, getting to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now  listen  .  .  .”  He  looked  particularly  hard  at  Harry.  “I  don’t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you’re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one’s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows,” Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t care . . . I’ll breathe freely again when this tournament’s </p>

<p class="calibre1">over, and that’s not until June. And don’t forget, if you’re talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak good-bye. “I’ll walk to the edge of the village with you,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Sirius, “see if I can scrounge another paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?” Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle. “But maybe he doesn’t care . . . it’d probably just make him admire Crouch even more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, Percy loves rules. He’d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione severely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” said Ron. “If he thought we were standing in the way of his career . . . Percy’s really ambitious, you know. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor old Snuffles,” said Ron, breathing deeply. “He must really like you, Harry. . . . Imagine having to live off rats.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">arry,  Ron,  and  Hermione  went  up  to  the  Owlery  after H breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen Mr. Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she’d had a job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his new socks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecsta-tic about his present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!” he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?” said Ron, who was looking around at the beaming and bowing house-elves. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p552"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve just had breakfast!” said Hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,” Harry muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good idea,” said Ron. “Give Pig something to do. You couldn’t give us a bit of extra food, could you?” he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dobby, where’s Winky?” said Hermione, who was looking around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winky is over there by the fire, miss,” said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh dear,” said Hermione as she spotted Winky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,” Dobby whispered to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s not strong, that stuff,” Harry said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Dobby shook his head. “ ’Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Winky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winky is pining,  Harry Potter,”  Dobby whispered sadly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Hey, Winky,” said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, “you don’t know what Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crouch might be up to, do you? Because he’s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Winky’s eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She swayed slightly again and then said, “M — Master is stopped —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, “we haven’t seen him since the first task. The <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet’s</i> saying he’s ill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Master —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — ill?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her bottom lip began to tremble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we’re not sure if that’s true,” said Hermione quickly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,” Hermione said severely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winky —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — is not only —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — doing housework for Mr. Crouch!” Winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse. “Master is —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — trusting Winky with —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — the most important —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — the most secret —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 537 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p554"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winky keeps —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — her master’s secrets,” she said mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed. “You is —  <i class="calibre3">hi</i> c <i class="calibre3"> </i>— nosing, you is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!” said Dobby angrily. “Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He is nosing —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — into my master’s —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — private and secret —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — Winky is a good house-elf —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — Winky keeps her silence —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — people trying to —  <i class="calibre3">hic</i> — pry and poke — </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">hic</i> —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Winky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!” squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. “We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s unhappy!” said Hermione, exasperated. “Why don’t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begging your pardon, miss,” said the house-elf, bowing deeply again, “but house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh for heaven’s sake!” Hermione cried. “Listen to me, all of you! You’ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You’ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don’t have to do everything you’re told — look at Dobby!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 538 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p555"></a>THE  MADNESS  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">MR.  CROUCH </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,” Dobby mumbled, looking scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she were mad and dangerous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry’s arms. “Good-bye!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!” Dobby called miserably from the hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They won’t want us visiting them now! We could’ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh as if you care about that!” scoffed Hermione. “You only like coming down here for the food!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well. When they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them, Harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 539 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p556"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrid’s chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of sight. Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin. Harry wondered what he was doing; it looked as  though  he  were  making a new vegetable patch. As he watched, Madame Maxime emerged from the Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid. She appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation. Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past him into the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">By breakfast the next day Ron’s and Hermione’s bad moods had burnt out, and to Harry’s relief, Ron’s dark predictions that the house-elves would send substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because Hermione had insulted them proved false; the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up eagerly; she seemed to be expecting something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Percy won’t’ve had time to answer yet,” said Ron. “We only sent Hedwig yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’s not that,” said Hermione. “I’ve taken out a subscription to the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet. </i> I’m getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the owls. “Hey, Hermione, I think you’re in luck —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 540 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p557"></a>THE  MADNESS  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">MR.  CROUCH </p>
<p class="calibre1">A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed. “It’s —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said Harry, seizing Hermione’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl, opening it, and starting to read. “Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s up?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s — oh how ridiculous —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwrit-ten, but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">You are a WickEd giRL. HarRy PotTER desErves BeTteR. GO back wherE you cAMe from mUGgle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re all like it!” said Hermione desperately, opening one letter after another. “ ‘ <i class="calibre3">Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of</i> <i class="calibre3">you. </i> . . .’ ‘ <i class="calibre3">You deserve to be boiled in frog spawn</i>. . . .’ Ouch!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had opened the last envelope, and yellowish-green liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands, which began to erupt in large yellow boils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Undiluted bubotuber pus!” said Ron, picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 541 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p558"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ow!” said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d better get up to the hospital wing,” said Harry as the owls around Hermione took flight. “We’ll tell Professor Sprout where you’ve gone. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I warned her!” said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall, cradling her hands. “I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Look at this one . . .” He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind: “ ‘ <i class="calibre3">I read in</i> Witch Weekly  <i class="calibre3">about how you are playing</i> <i class="calibre3">Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be</i> <i class="calibre3">sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope. </i>’ Blimey, she’d better watch out for herself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione didn’t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the  <i class="calibre3">Witch Weekly</i> article had caused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of the crates — surely not another skrewt hatching? — but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 542 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p559"></a>THE  MADNESS  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">MR.  CROUCH </p>
<p class="calibre1">were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. “Yeh find ’em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. . . . There yeh go, look.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson’s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Useful little treasure detectors,” said Hagrid happily. “Thought we’d have some fun with ’em today. See over there?” He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window. “I’ve buried some gold coins. I’ve got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most. Jus’ take off all yer valuables, an’ choose a niffler, an’ get ready ter set ’em loose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn’t work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he picked up a niffler. It put its long snout in Harry’s ear and sniffed enthusiastically. It was really quite cuddly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on,” said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, “there’s a spare niffler here . . . who’s missin’? Where’s Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She had to go to the hospital wing,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll explain later,” Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures. The nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water, each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands. Ron’s was particularly efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 543 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p560"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?” he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil, splattering his robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, Ron,” said Hagrid, grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They wreck houses, nifflers. I reckon they’ve nearly got the lot, now,” he added, pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive. “I on’y buried a hundred coins. Oh there y’are, Hermione!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was walking toward them across the lawn. Her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching her beadily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, let’s check how yeh’ve done!” said Hagrid. “Count yer coins! An’ there’s no point tryin’ ter steal any, Goyle,” he added, his beetle-black eyes narrowed. “It’s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It turned out that Ron’s niffler had been most successful, so Hagrid gave him an  enormous  slab  of  Honeydukes  chocolate for a prize. The bell rang across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes. Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching them out of her carriage window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?” said Hagrid, looking concerned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning, and the envelope full of bubotuber pus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaah, don’ worry,” said Hagrid gently, looking down at her. “I got some o’ those letters an’ all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou’ me mum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘ <i class="calibre3">Yeh’re a monster an’ yeh should be put down</i>.’ ‘ <i class="calibre3">Yer mother killed innocent</i> <i class="calibre3">people an’ if you had any decency you’d jump in a lake. </i>’ ” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p561"></a>THE  MADNESS  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">MR.  CROUCH </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Hermione, looking shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall. “They’re jus’ nutters, Hermione. Don’ open ’em if yeh get any more. Chuck ’em straigh’ in the fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You missed a really good lesson,” Harry told Hermione as they headed back toward the castle. “They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, Ron?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him. He looked thoroughly put out about something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the matter?” said Harry. “Wrong flavor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Ron shortly. “Why didn’t you tell me about the gold?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What gold?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn’t you tell me it disappeared?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh . . .” he said, the memory coming  back  to  him  at  last.  “I dunno . . . I never noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great Hall for lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Must be nice,” Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings. “To have so much money you don’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!” said Harry impatiently. “We all did, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 545 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p562"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t know leprechaun gold vanishes,” Ron muttered. “I thought I was paying you back. You shouldn’t’ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forget it, all right?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he said, “I hate being poor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of them really knew what to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s rubbish,” said Ron, still glaring down at his potato. “I don’t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a niffler.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,” said Hermione brightly. Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, Ron, it could be worse. At least your fingers aren’t full of pus.” Hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen. “I  <i class="calibre3">hate</i> that Skeeter woman!” she burst out savagely. “I’ll get her back for this if it’s the last thing I do!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week, and although she followed Hagrid’s advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill-wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hal  to hear. Even those people who didn’t read  <i class="calibre3">Witch Weekly</i> knew all about the supposed Harry-Krum-Hermione triangle now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was getting sick of tel ing people that Hermione wasn’t his girlfriend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll die down, though,” he told Hermione, “if we just ignore  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 546 � </p>

<p class="calibre1">it. . . . People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to know how she’s listening into private conversations when she’s supposed to be banned from the grounds!” said Hermione angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex-deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione panted five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and pulling Harry’s hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her. “Moody says he didn’t see her anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Hermione stubbornly. “I want to know how she heard me talking to Viktor!  <i class="calibre3">And</i> how she found out about Hagrid’s mum!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bugged?” said Ron blankly. “What . . . put fleas on her or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment. Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them. </p>
