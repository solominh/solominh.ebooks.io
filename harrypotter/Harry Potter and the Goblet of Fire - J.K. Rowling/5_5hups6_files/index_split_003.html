<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’re we going to do today, then?” Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Ron, “just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve just realized — I haven’t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet!” she said brightly. “Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it with her?” said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, Ron,” said Harry suddenly. “It’s your friend . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames. As each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t chosen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire. “Reckon they’ll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno,” said Harry. “Hang around, I suppose. . . . Madame Maxime’s staying to judge, isn’t she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 262 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are  <i class="calibre3">they  </i> sleeping, then?” said Ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione’s reappearance with the box of S.P.E.W. badges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh good, hurry up,” said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they neared Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons’ sleeping quarters was solved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid’s front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry knocked on Hagrid’s door, and Fang’s booming barks answered instantly </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Bout time!” said Hagrid, when he’d flung open the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thought you lot’d forgotten where I live!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve been really busy, Hag —” Hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn’t the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches — perhaps he had tried a ponytail like </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 263 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill’s, but found he had too much hair. The look didn’t really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, “Erm — where are the skrewts?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out by the pumpkin patch,” said Hagrid happily. “They’re gettin’ massive, mus’ be nearly three foot long now. On’y trouble is, they’ve started killin’ each other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh no, really?” said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid’s odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Hagrid sadly. “ ’S’ okay, though, I’ve got ’em in separate boxes now. Still got abou’ twenty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s lucky,” said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You wait,” he said, grinning. “You jus’ wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh’ve never seen before. Firs’ task . . . ah, but I’m not supposed ter say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go on, Hagrid!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’ want ter spoil it fer yeh,” said Hagrid. “But it’s gonna be spectacular, I’ll tell yeh that. Them champions’re going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 264 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn’t eat much — Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to  be  selected  as  champions,  and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves — for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W. </p>
<p class="calibre1">when she showed him her badges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’d be doin’ ’em an unkindness, Hermione,” he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. “It’s in their nature ter look after humans, that’s what they like, see? Yeh’d be makin’ ’em unhappy ter take away their work, an’ insultin’ ’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione. “<i class="calibre3">And</i> we heard he’s asking for wages now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I’m not sayin’ there isn’t the odd elf who’d take freedom, but yeh’ll never persuade most of ’em ter do it — no, nothin’ doin’, Hermione.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast — and, more important, the announcement of the school champions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 265 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll come with yeh,” said Hagrid, putting away his darning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jus’ give us a sec.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid  got  up,  went  across  to  the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it. They didn’t pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, “Hagrid, what’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh?” said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. “Don’ yeh like it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that aftershave?” said Hermione in a slightly choked voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — eau de cologne,” Hagrid muttered. He was blushing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe it’s a bit much,” he said gruffly. “I’ll go take it off, hang on . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eau de cologne?” said Hermione in amazement. “<i class="calibre3">Hagrid</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said Harry in an undertone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!” said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid had just straightened up and turned ’round. If he had been blushing before, it  was  nothing  to  what  he  was  doing  now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn’t spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. They couldn’t hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before — when he had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 266 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s going up to the castle with her!” said Hermione indignantly. “I thought he was waiting for us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He fancies her!” said Ron incredulously. “Well, if they end up having children, they’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooh it’s them, look!” Hermione whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake. Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang students were straggling along behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione, Ron, and Harry and proceeded through them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Goblet of Fire had been moved; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore’s empty chair at the teachers’ table. Fred and George — clean-shaven again — seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So do I!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Well, we’ll soon know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 267 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn’t seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally. Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone. Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,” said Dumbledore. “I estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions’ names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber” — he indicated the door behind the staff table — “where they will be receiving their first instructions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet  of  Fire  now  shone  more  brightly  than  anything  in  the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting. . . . A few people kept checking their watches. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any second,” Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 268 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it — the whole room gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm’s length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice, “will be Viktor Krum.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause. “Knew you had it in you! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 269 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Disappointed” was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers’ table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. “Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 270 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Harry Potter. </i>” </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">arry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had H turned to look at him. He was stunned. He felt numb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was surely dreaming. He had not heard correctly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long Gryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  didn’t  put  my  name  in,”  Harry said blankly. “You know I didn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both of them stared just as blankly back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 272 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a>THE  FOUR  CHAMPIONS </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you please!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go on,” Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly. He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder. After what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well . . . through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He wasn’t smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry moved off along the teachers’ table. Hagrid was seated right at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting. He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else. Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started whispering in his ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 273 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?” she said. “Do zey want us back in ze Hall?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn’t know how to explain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three champions. It struck him how very tall all of them were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm. “Absolutely extraordinary! Gentlemen . . . lady,” he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three. “May I introduce — incredible though it may seem — the  <i class="calibre3">fourth</i> Triwizard champion?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester Bagman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely bewildered. Fleur frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But evidently zair ’as been a mistake,” she said contemptuously to Bagman. “ ’E cannot compete. ’E is too young.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well . . . it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry. “But, as you know, the age restriction </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 274 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a>THE  FOUR  CHAMPIONS </p>
<p class="calibre1">was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name’s come out of the goblet . . . I mean, I don’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It’s down in the rules, you’re obliged . . . Harry will just have to do the best he —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor McGonagall closed the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress. “Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger.  <i class="calibre3">Little boy</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her gigantic black-satin bosom swelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” she said imperiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. “<i class="calibre3">Two</i> Hogwarts champions? I don’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions — or have I not read the rules carefully enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gave a short and nasty laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">C’est impossible, </i>” said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting upon Fleur’s shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Ogwarts  cannot  ’ave  two  champions. It is most injust.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, his steely </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 275 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">smile still in place, though his eyes were colder than ever. “Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” said Snape softly. His black eyes were alight with malice. “Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Severus,” said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” he asked calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?” said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">No, </i>” said Harry vehemently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, but of course ’e is lying!” cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “I am sure we are all agreed on that —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbly-dorr must ’ave made a mistake wiz ze line,” said Madame Maxime, shrugging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is possible, of course,” said Dumbledore politely </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 276 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>THE  FOUR  CHAMPIONS </p>
<p class="calibre1">mistake!” said Professor McGonagall angrily. “Really, what non-sense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shot a very angry look at Professor Snape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Bagman,” said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, “you are our — er — objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most irregular?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” said Karkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s only fair, Dumbledore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But  Karkaroff,  it  doesn’t  work  like  that,”  said  Bagman.  “The Goblet of Fire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of the next tournament —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 277 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can’t leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a loud  <i class="calibre3">clunk. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled themselves into fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone put Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if it came out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!” said Madame Maxime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic  <i class="calibre3">and</i> the International Confederation of Wizards —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If anyone’s got reason to complain, it’s Potter,” growled Moody, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but . . . funny thing . . . I don’t hear  <i class="calibre3">him</i> saying a word. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why should ’e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. “ ’E ’as ze chance to compete, ’asn’t ’e? We ’ave all been </p>
<p class="calibre1">’oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 278 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p295"></a>THE  FOUR  CHAMPIONS </p>
<p class="calibre1">A thousand Galleons in prize money — zis is a chance many would die for!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe someone’s hoping Potter  <i class="calibre3">is</i> going to die for it,” said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, “Moody, old man . . . what a thing to say!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Karkaroff loudly. “Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody. “Seeing things, eh? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy’s name in that goblet. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!” said Moody. “It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament. . . . I’m guessing they submitted Potter’s name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Karkaroff coldly, “and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1">your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So you’ll understand if we don’t take you entirely seriously. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,” Moody retorted in a menacing voice. “It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff — as you ought to remember. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alastor!” said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to, but then realized “Mad-Eye” </p>
<p class="calibre1">could hardly be Moody’s real first name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction — Karkaroff’s face was burning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room. “It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, but Dumbly-dorr —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to hear it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared. She wasn’t the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman, however, looked rather excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, shall we crack on, then?” he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room. “Got to give our champions their instructions, haven’t we? Barty, want to do the honors?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he said, “instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill. There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 280 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a>THE  FOUR  CHAMPIONS </p>
<p class="calibre1">papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The first task is designed to test your daring,” he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, “so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard . . . very important. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands. They will receive information about the second task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and time-consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from end-of-year tests.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think that’s all, is it, Albus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think so,” said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild concern. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,” said Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crouch. “It is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve left young Weatherby in charge. . . . Very enthusiastic . . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, Barty, I’m staying!” said Bagman brightly. “It’s all happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 281 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think not, Ludo,” said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap?” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur’s shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said Dumbledore, smiling at both of them. “I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile. “We’re playing against each other again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I s’pose,” said Harry. He really couldn’t think of anything to say. The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been ransacked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . tell me . . .” said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. “How  <i class="calibre3">did</i> you get your name in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t,” said Harry, staring up at him. “I didn’t put it in. I was telling the truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 282 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a>THE  FOUR  CHAMPIONS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah . . . okay,” said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn’t believe him. “Well . . . see you, then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its right. Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he’d put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who’d had three years’ more magical education than he had — </p>
<p class="calibre1">when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he’d thought about it . . . he’d fantasized about it . . . but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream . . . he’d never really, <i class="calibre3">seriously</i> considered entering. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But someone else had considered it . . . someone else had wanted him in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To give him a treat? He didn’t think so, somehow. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">To see him make a fool of himself? Wel , they were likely to get their wish. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But to get him  <i class="calibre3">killed</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn’t someone have put Harry’s name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did anyone really want him dead? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old . . . Lord Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry’s name got into the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 283 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone . . . feeble and powerless. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone . . . he had been talking to Wormtail . . . plotting Harry’s murder. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady, “Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Balderdash,” said Harry dully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 284 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>THE  FOUR  CHAMPIONS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t,” Harry said. “I don’t know how —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Angelina had now swooped down upon him; “Oh if it couldn’t be me, at least it’s a Gryffindor —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!” shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate. . . . Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn’t get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands. . . . Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore’s Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t,” he said, over and over again, “I don’t know how it happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m tired!” he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour. “No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  wanted  more  than  anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 285 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’ve you been?” Harry said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh hello,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,” he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. “Congratulations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you mean, congratulations?” said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well . . . no one else got across the Age Line,” said Ron. “Not even Fred and George. What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Invisibility Cloak wouldn’t have got me over that line,” said Harry slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh right,” said Ron. “I thought you might’ve told me if it was the cloak . . . because it would’ve covered both of us, wouldn’t it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But you found another way, did you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,” said Harry, “I didn’t put my name in that goblet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone else must’ve done it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron raised his eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What would they do that for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 286 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a>THE  FOUR  CHAMPIONS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno,” said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodra-matic to say, “To kill me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay, you know, you can tell  <i class="calibre3">me</i> the truth,” he said. “If you don’t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie, you didn’t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady’s, that Violet, she’s already told us all Dumbledore’s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And you don’t have to do end-of-year tests either. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t put my name in that goblet!” said Harry, starting to feel angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. “Only you said this morning you’d have done it last night, and no one would’ve seen you. . . . I’m not stupid, you know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re doing a really good impression of it,” Harry snapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. “You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you’ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him. </p>

<p class="calibre1">hen Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a W moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him — only to find that Ron’s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>THE  WEIGHING  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  WANDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,” she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. “I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good idea,” said Harry gratefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself,” she said when he’d finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who  <i class="calibre3">did</i> put it in? Because Moody’s right, Harry . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t think any student could have done it . . . they’d never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over Dumbledore’s —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you seen Ron?” Harry interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Erm . . . yes . . . he was at breakfast,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does he still think I entered myself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well . . . no, I don’t think so . . . not  <i class="calibre3">really, </i>” said Hermione awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not  <i class="calibre3">really</i>’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh Harry, isn’t it obvious?” Hermione said despairingly. “He’s jealous!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Jealous</i>?” Harry said incredulously. “Jealous of what? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it’s always you who gets all the attention, you know it is. I know it’s not your fault,” she added </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 289 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. “I know you don’t ask for it . . . but — well — you know, Ron’s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you’re his best friend, and you’re really famous — he’s always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,” said Harry bitterly. “Real y great. Tel  him from me I’l swap any time he wants. Tel  him from me he’s welcome to it. . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I’m not telling him anything,” Hermione said shortly. “Tell him yourself. It’s the only way to sort this out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not running around after him trying to make him grow up!” Harry said, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm. “Maybe he’ll believe I’m not enjoying myself once I’ve got my neck broken or —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not funny,” said Hermione quietly. “That’s not funny at all.” She looked extremely anxious. “Harry, I’ve been thinking — </p>
<p class="calibre1">you know what we’ve got to do, don’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Write to Sirius. </i>  You’ve  got  to  tel   him  what’s  happened.  He asked you to keep him posted on everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. . . .

<p class="calibre1">“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn’t be overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. “He came back to the country just because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament —” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">He’d want you to tell him, </i>” said Hermione sternly. “He’s going to find out anyway —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said Hermione, very seriously. “This tournament’s famous, and you’re famous. I’ll be really surprised if there isn’t anything in the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> about you competing. . . . You’re already in half the books about You-Know-Who, you know . . . and Sirius would rather hear it from you, I know he would.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, okay, I’ll write to him,” said Harry, throwing his last piece of toast into the lake. They both stood and watched it floating there for a moment, before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface. Then they returned to the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they climbed the stairs. “He told me not to use Hedwig again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask Ron if you can borrow —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They went up to the Owlery Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn’t think how to trans-late this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak </i>— </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his shoulder and held out her leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for the school owls. “I’ve got to use one of these. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First Ron, then you,” said Harry angrily. “<i class="calibre3">This isn’t my fault. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons — and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 292 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p309"></a>THE  WEIGHING  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  WANDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion’s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him — but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too — the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer. . . . Half the Triwizard champions have </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 293 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p310"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">died . . . how long d’you reckon you’re going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class’s horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take this thing for a walk?” he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes. “And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roun’ the middle,” said Hagrid, demonstrating. “Er — yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus’ as an extra precaution, like. Harry — you come here  an’  help  me  with  this  big one. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry away from the rest of the class. He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, “So — </p>
<p class="calibre1">yer competin’, Harry. In the tournament. School champion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One of the champions,” Harry corrected him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said Harry, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid’s words. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 294 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a>THE  WEIGHING  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  WANDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Course I do,” Hagrid grunted. “Yeh say it wasn’ you, an’ I believe yeh — an’ Dumbledore believes yer, an’ all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wish I knew who  <i class="calibre3">did</i> do it,” said Harry bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs — but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong and very hard to control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look like they’re havin’ fun, don’ they?” Hagrid said happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren’t; every now and then, with an alarming <i class="calibre3">bang, </i> one of the skrewts’ ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, I don’ know, Harry,” Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face. “School champion . . . everythin’ seems ter happen ter you, doesn’ it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to him . . . that was more or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to her, that Ron was no longer talking to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The next few days were some of Harry’s worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had been on  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 295 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school’s behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn’t going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn’t want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could understand the Hufflepuffs’ attitude, even if he didn’t like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins — he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by trick-ing the goblet into accepting his name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptional y handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen to get Krum’s autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick’s class that he was given extra homework — the only person to get any, apart from Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione tried to reassure him as they left Flitwick’s class — she had been making objects </p>

<p class="calibre1">zoom across the room to her al  lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. “You just weren’t concentrating properly —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonder why that was,” said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt. “Still — never mind, eh? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday’s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore them, ignore them, ignore them” under her breath, and he couldn’t see why today should be any better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he and Hermione arrived at Snape’s dungeon after lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges — then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage: </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Like them, Potter?” said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And this isn’t all they do — look!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 297 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a><img src="index-314_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green: The Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed their badges too, until the message  <i class="calibre3">POTTER STINKS </i> was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt the heat rise in his face and neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh  <i class="calibre3">very</i> funny,” Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, “really  <i class="calibre3">witty. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sticking up for Harry either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want one, Granger?” said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione. “I’ve got loads. But don’t touch my hand, now. I’ve just washed it, you see; don’t want a Mudblood sliming it up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his wand before he’d thought what he was doing. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry!” Hermione said warningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go on, then, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand. “Moody’s not here to look after you now — do it, if you’ve got the guts —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a split second, they looked into each other’s eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Furnunculus</i>!” Harry yelled. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p315"></a>THE  WEIGHING  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  WANDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Densaugeo</i>!” screamed Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit Hermione. Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were springing up — Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione’s hand away from her face. It wasn’t a pretty sight. Hermione’s front teeth — already larger than average — were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin — panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Explain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter attacked me, sir —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and he hit Goyle — look —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “<i class="calibre3">Look</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth — she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the  </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape’s back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it’l  be a week’s worth of detentions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table. Ron was shaking with anger too — for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving Harry alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon, Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge, smirking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">POTTER STINKS </i> flashed once more across the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to him. . . . If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse . . . he’d have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching. . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">your recipes now. I want you to brew them carefully, and then, we will be selecting someone on whom to test one. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape’s eyes met Harry’s, and Harry knew what was coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape was going to poison  <i class="calibre3">him. </i> Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape’s greasy head — </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry’s thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape’s desk at the front of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” said Snape curtly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said Snape coldly. “He will come upstairs when this class is finished.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colin went pink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir — sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously. “All the champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying those last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped. “Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, sir — he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Colin. “All the champions —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very  <i class="calibre3">well </i>!” said Snape. “Potter — take your bag and get out of my sight!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">STINKS </i> flashed at him from every direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to speak the moment Harry had closed the dungeon door behind him. “Isn’t it, though? You being champion?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, really amazing,” said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall. “What do they want photos for, Colin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet, </i> I think!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,” said Harry dully. “Exactly  what  I  need.  More  publicity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the right room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry knocked on the door and entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three of them, however, had been placed end-to-end in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody. Cedric and Fleur were in conversation. Fleur looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing  back  her  head  so  that  her long silvery hair caught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come . . . nothing to worry about, it’s just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wand weighing?” Harry repeated nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you know, as they’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead,” said Bagman. “The expert’s upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there’s going to be a little photo shoot. This is Rita Skeeter,” he added, gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes. “She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the  <i class="calibre3">Daily</i> <i class="calibre3">Prophet</i>. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe not  <i class="calibre3">that</i> small, Ludo,” said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted crimson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. “The youngest champion, you know . . . to add a bit of color?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly!” cried Bagman. “That is — if Harry has no objection?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er —” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had Harry’s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she said. “Let’s see . . . ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her. </p>

<p class="calibre1">She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You won’t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill? It leaves me free to talk to you normally. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A what?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita Skeeter’s smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acid-green quill and a roll of parchment, which she stretched out between them on a crate of Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright on the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Testing . . . my name is Rita Skeeter,  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> reporter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment: </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her </p>

<p class="calibre1">what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er —” said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though he wasn’t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence: An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ignore the quill, Harry,” said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly, Harry looked up at her instead. “Now — why did you decide to enter the tournament, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t,” said Harry. “I don’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire. I didn’t put it in there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come now, Harry, there’s no need to be scared of getting into trouble. We all know you shouldn’t really have entered at all. But don’t worry about that. Our readers love a rebel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I didn’t enter,” Harry repeated. “I don’t know who —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you feel about the tasks ahead?” said Rita Skeeter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excited? Nervous?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t really thought . . . yeah, nervous, I suppose,” said Harry. His insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said Rita Skeeter briskly. “Have you thought about that at all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well . . . they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forward as though it were skating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 305 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, you’ve looked death in the face before, haven’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Rita Skeeter, watching him closely. “How would you say that’s affected you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er,” said Harry, yet again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I didn’t enter, </i>” said Harry, starting to feel irritated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and looked down at words the quill had just written: Tears fill those startling green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open. Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. Albus Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both of them, squashed into the cupboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Dumbledore</i>!” cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight — but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE  WANDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita’s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag. “How are you?” she said, standing up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. “I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards’ Conference?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enchantingly nasty,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita Skeeter didn’t look remotely abashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned, Dumbledore, and that many wizards in the street —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,” said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room. The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down quickly next to Cedric, looking up at the velvet-covered table, where four of the five judges were now sitting — Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr. Crouch, and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?” said Dumbledore, taking his place at the judges’ table and talking to the champions. “He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 307 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before — he was the wand-maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and handed him her wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm . . .” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it close to his eyes and examined it carefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he said quietly, “nine and a half inches . . . inflexible . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">rosewood . . . and containing . . . dear me . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An  ’air  from  ze  ’ead  of  a  veela,”  said  Fleur.  “One  of  my grandmuzzer’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Fleur  <i class="calibre3">was</i> part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to tell Ron . . . then he remembered that Ron wasn’t speaking to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, “yes, I’ve never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather temperamental wands . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, to each his own, and if this suits you . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered, “<i class="calibre3">Orchideous</i>!” and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand. “Mr. Diggory, you next.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a>THE  WEIGHING  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  WANDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. “Yes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn . . . must have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches . . . ash . . . pleasantly springy. It’s in fine condition. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">You treat it regularly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Polished it last night,” said Cedric, grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of Cedric’s wand, pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, “Mr. Krum, if you please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duck-footed, toward Mr. Ollivander. He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I’m much mistaken? A fine wand-maker, though the styling is never quite what I . . . however . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at Krum, who nodded. “Rather thicker than one usually sees . . . quite rigid . . . ten and a quarter inches . . .  <i class="calibre3">Avis</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of </p>

<p class="calibre1">small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which leaves . . . Mr. Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He handed over his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. “Yes, yes, yes. How well I remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ollivander’s shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him — this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. “Curious,” he had said, “curious,” and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry’s wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort’s wand was something it couldn’t help — </p>
<p class="calibre1">rather as he couldn’t help being related to Aunt Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn’t about to tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 310 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a>THE  WEIGHING  OF </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  WANDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry’s wand than anyone else’s. Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">table.  “You  may  go  back  to  your  lessons  now  —  or  perhaps  it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Photos, Dumbledore, photos!” cried Bagman excitedly. “Al  the judges and champions, what do you think, Rita?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — yes, let’s do those first,” said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again. “And then perhaps some individual shots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn’t stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn’t there — he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor </p>

<p class="calibre1">“You’ve had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was pointing at Harry’s pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh — right,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape’s dungeon,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, Harry considered going after him — he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing — but the lure of Sirius’s answer was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrol ed it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">he prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that T sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker. The shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him like some horrific monster, barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been leading up to, and would finish with, the first task. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Admittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. Harry wrote  back  to  Sirius  saying  that  he  would  be  beside  the  common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested, and he and Hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn’t have to resort to that — Filch would skin them alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn’t remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know they’d be very proud of me if they could see me now. . . .

<p class="calibre1">But Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend, Colin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry, is one of the top students in the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people — Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey — Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just about enough. “I’ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and I’m just off to do a bit more. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No — it was just — you dropped your quill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er . . . good luck on Tuesday,” she said. “I really hope you do well.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid Hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she hadn’t yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Stunningly pretty</i>?  <i class="calibre3">Her</i>?” Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come face-to-face with Hermione after Rita’s article had appeared. “What was she judging against — a chipmunk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ignore it,” Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn’t hear them. “Just ignore it, Harry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry couldn’t ignore it. Ron hadn’t spoken to him at all since he had told him about Snape’s detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats’ brains in Snape’s dungeon, but that had been the day Rita’s article had appeared, which seemed  to  have  confirmed Ron’s belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry was adamant: He would talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn’t put his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t start this,” Harry said stubbornly. “It’s his problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You miss him!” Hermione said impatiently. “And I  <i class="calibre3">know</i> he misses you —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Miss him</i>?” said Harry. “I don’t  <i class="calibre3">miss him. </i> . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn’t the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was </p>

<p class="calibre1">your best friend. Harry still hadn’t mastered Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. They consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor  Krum  was  in  the  library an awful lot too, and Harry wondered what he was up to. Was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through the first task? Hermione often complained about Krum being there — not that he ever bothered them — but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise distracting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s not even good-looking!” she muttered angrily, glaring at Krum’s sharp profile. “They only like him because he’s famous! </p>
<p class="calibre1">They wouldn’t look twice at him if he couldn’t do that Wonky-Faint thing —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wronski Feint,” said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron’s expression if he could have heard Hermione talking about Wonky-Faints. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks  to  work  at  double  speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> article. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hermione told Harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit, and Harry didn’t need much persuasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about Ron, though?” he said. “Don’t you want to go with him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh . . . well . . .” Hermione went slightly pink. “I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry flatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh Harry, this is so stupid —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll come, but I’m not meeting Ron, and I’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh all right then . . .” Hermione snapped, “but I hate talking to you in that cloak, I never know if I’m looking at you or not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went back downstairs, and together he and Hermione set off for Hogsmeade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village, most of them sporting  <i class="calibre3">Support Cedric Diggory</i>! badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that stupid article. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People keep looking at  <i class="calibre3">me</i> now,” said Hermione grumpily as they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large cream-filled chocolates. “They think I’m talking to myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t move your lips so much then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come  <i class="calibre3">on, </i> please just take off your cloak for a bit, no one’s going to bother you here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah?” said Harry. “Look behind you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 318 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a>THE  HUNGARIAN </p>
<p class="calibre1">HORNTAIL </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Three Broomsticks pub. Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione without looking at her. Harry backed into the wal  of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag. When they were gone, Harry said, “She’s staying in the village. I bet she’s coming to watch the first task.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn’t mention this; he and Hermione hadn’t discussed what was coming in the first task much; he had the feeling she didn’t want to think about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street. “Why don’t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it’s a bit cold, isn’t it? You don’t have to talk to Ron!” she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions. Harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard poke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 319 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I  look  like  such  an  idiot,  sitting  here  on  my  own,”  she  muttered. “Lucky I brought something to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron’s names at the top of the very short list. It seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together, and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved  in  S.P.E.W.,”  Hermione  said thoughtfully, looking around the pub. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, right,” said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak. “Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she hissed back. “You know, I’m starting to think it’s time for more direct action. I wonder how you get into the school kitchens?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No idea, ask Fred and George,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub. All of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them sporting  <i class="calibre3">Support Cedric Diggory</i>! badges on their cloaks. Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw friends. She wasn’t wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This cheered up Harry very slightly. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">What wouldn’t he have given to be one of these people, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name   <i class="calibre3">hadn’t</i> come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn’t be </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 320 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a>THE  HUNGARIAN </p>
<p class="calibre1">HORNTAIL </p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sitting with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday. He’d have been really looking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was . . . cheering on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And  Krum  just  sat  in  the  library,  poring over books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire — assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look, it’s Hagrid!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The back of Hagrid’s enormous shaggy head — he had mercifully abandoned his bunches — emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn’t spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn’t seem to think much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 321 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He waved, then remembered that Hagrid couldn’t see him. Moody, however, paused, his magical eye on the corner where Harry was standing. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and Hermione’s table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, Hermione?” said Hagrid loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,” said Hermione, smiling back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought he was reading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, “Nice cloak, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing from Moody’s nose was particularly obvious at a few inches’ distance. Moody grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can your eye — I mean, can you — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,” Moody said quietly. “And it’s come in useful at times, I can tell you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew Hagrid couldn’t see him, but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was there. Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only Harry could hear it, “Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin. Wear that cloak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see yeh, Hermione,” winked, and departed. Moody followed him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a>THE  HUNGARIAN </p>
<p class="calibre1">HORNTAIL </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?” Harry said, very surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does he?” said Hermione, looking startled. “I wonder what he’s up to? I don’t know whether you should go, Harry. . . .” She looked nervously around and hissed, “It might make you late for Sirius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was true that going down to Hagrid’s at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid’s to tell him he couldn’t go — always assuming she would consent to take the note, of course — Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what this might be; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go up to bed early, pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room. Quite a few people were still in there. The Creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of  <i class="calibre3">Support Cedric Diggory</i>! badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say  <i class="calibre3">Support Harry Potter</i>! instead. So far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on  <i class="calibre3">POTTER STINKS. </i> Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned. He slipped past her with a whispered “Thanks!” and set off through the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in Hagrid’s cabin. The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid’s front door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 323 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You there, Harry?” Hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head. “What’s up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got summat ter show yeh,” said Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his but-tonhole. It looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair — Harry could see the comb’s broken teeth tangled in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’re you showing me?” Harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered with that cloak,” said Hagrid. “We won’ take Fang, he won’ like it. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long. . . . I’ve got to be back up at the castle by one o’clock —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Hagrid wasn’t listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagrid, what — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shhh!” said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, ’Agrid . . . it is time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bong-sewer,” said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 324 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a>THE  HUNGARIAN </p>
<p class="calibre1">HORNTAIL </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime’s giant winged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them. Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he wanted . . . she wasn’t exactly hard to miss. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because after a while she said playfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ’Agrid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said Hagrid gruffly, “worth seein’, trust me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On’y — don’ go tellin’ anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course not,” said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in their wake, checking his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn’t get there soon, he was going to turn around, go straight back to the castle, and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then — when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight — Harry heard something. Men were shouting up ahead . . . then came a deafening, earsplitting roar. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them — for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them — </p>
<p class="calibre1">and then his mouth fell open. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dragons. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 325 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rear-ing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting — torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery-blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard-like than the others, which was nearest to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs. Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or rage, he couldn’t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding. “They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know! I’ve seen this Horntail do forty!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning Spells, on the count of three!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Stupefy</i>!” they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons’ scaly hides — </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>THE  HUNGARIAN </p>
<p class="calibre1">HORNTAIL </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame, though stil  smoking — then, very slowly, it fell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the ground with their wands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wan’ a closer look?” Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pair of them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wizard who had warned Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and Harry realized who it was: Charlie Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk. “They should be okay now — we put them out with a Sleeping Draft on the way here, thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet — but, like you saw, they weren’t happy, not happy at all —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What breeds you got here, Charlie?” said Hagrid, gazing at the closest dragon, the black one, with something close to reverence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its eyes were still just open. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie. “There’s a Common Welsh Green over there, the smaller one — a Swedish Short-Snout, that blue-gray — and a Chinese Fireball, that’s the red.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the stunned dragons. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 327 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,” Charlie said, frowning. “The champions aren’t supposed to know what’s coming — she’s bound to tell her student, isn’t she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jus’ thought she’d like ter see ’em,” shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really romantic date, Hagrid,” said Charlie, shaking his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Four . . .” said Hagrid, “so it’s one fer each o’ the champions, is it? What’ve they gotta do — fight ’em?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just get past them, I think,” said Charlie. “We’ll be on hand if it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nest-ing mothers, I don’t know why . . . but I tell you this, I don’t envy the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious thing. Its back end’s as dangerous as its front, look.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charlie pointed toward the Horntail’s tail, and Harry saw long, bronze-colored spikes protruding along it every few inches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five of Charlie’s fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at that moment, carrying a clutch of huge granite-gray eggs between them in a blanket. They placed them carefully at the Horntail’s side. Hagrid let out a moan of longing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got them counted, Hagrid,” said Charlie sternly. Then he said, “How’s Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,” said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just hope he’s still fine after he’s faced this lot,” said Charlie grimly, looking out over the dragons’ enclosure. “I didn’t dare tell Mum what he’s got to do for the first task; she’s already having kit-tens about him. . . .” Charlie imitated his mother’s anxious voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘ <i class="calibre3">How could they let him enter that tournament, he’s much too young</i>! </p>

<p class="calibre1">‘ <i class="calibre3">He still cries about his parents</i>!  <i class="calibre3">Oh bless him, I never knew</i>!’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn’t miss him, with the attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently and began to walk away, back to the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn’t know whether he was glad he’d seen what was coming or not. Perhaps this way was better. The first shock was over now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe if he’d seen the dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have passed out cold in front of the whole school . . . but maybe he would anyway. . . . He was going to be armed with his wand — which, just now, felt like nothing more than a narrow strip of wood — against a fifty-foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, fire-breathing dragon. And he had to get past it. With everyone watching.  <i class="calibre3">How</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he couldn’t remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now — when, without warning, he ran into something very solid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around him. A voice nearby said, “Ouch! Who’s there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and lay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He recognized the goatee . . . it was Karkaroff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s there?” said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a minute or so, Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be. He might even have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together — they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance . . . and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know what was in store for the champions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on Tuesday was Cedric. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn’t dare slow down. . . . He had less than five minutes to get up to the fire. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Balderdash!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you say so,” she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the picture swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the </p>

<p class="calibre1">flames were the only source of light. Nearby, on a table, the  <i class="calibre3">Support</i> <i class="calibre3">Cedric Diggory</i>! badges the Creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight. They now read  <i class="calibre3">POTTER REALLY </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">STINKS. </i> Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius’s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn’t seen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys’ kitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits. Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius — how’re you doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him. When they had said good-bye, Sirius’s face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair — but the hair was short and clean now, Sirius’s face was fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him, which had been taken at the Potters’ wedding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never mind me, how are you?” said Sirius seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m —” For a second, Harry tried to say “fine” — but he couldn’t do it. Before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he’d talked in days — about how no one believed he hadn’t entered the tournament of his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him in the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet, </i> how he couldn’t walk down a corridor without being sneered at — and about Ron, Ron not believing him, Ron’s jealousy . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in the first task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner,” he finished desperately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet lost the look that Azkaban had given them — that deadened, haunted look. He had let Harry talk himself into silence without </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 331 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">interruption, but now he said, “Dragons we can deal with, Harry, but we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long here . . . I’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time. There are things I need to warn you about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches. . . . Surely there could be nothing worse than dragons coming? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karkaroff,” said Sirius. “Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know what Death Eaters are, don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes — he — what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d bet everything that’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year — to keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karkaroff got released?” Harry said slowly — his brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information. “Why did they release him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,” said Sirius bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He said he’d seen the error of his ways, and then he named names . . . he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place. . . . He’s not very popular in there, I can tell you. And since he got out, from what I can tell, he’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his. So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Harry slowly. “But . . . are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet? Because if he did, he’s a really good actor. He seemed furious about it. He wanted to stop me from competing.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">HORNTAIL </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We know he’s a good actor,” said Sirius, “because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn’t he? Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet, </i> Harry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“— and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman’s article last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm,” Sirius said hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, “but I don’t think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no one’s going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye’s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn’t mean he can’t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . what are you saying?” said Harry slowly. “Karkaroff’s trying to kill me? But — why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirius hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been hearing some very strange things,” he said slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn’t they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone set off the Dark Mark . . . and then — did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who’s gone missing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bertha Jorkins?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but . . . it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 333 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>CHAPTER  NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly. “She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good combination, Harry. I’d say she’d be very easy to lure into a trap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said Harry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karkaroff doesn’t strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and I can’t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said Harry grinning bleakly. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. “There’s a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way, and a simple spell’s all you need. Just —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him. </p>

<p class="calibre1">HORNTAIL </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “<i class="calibre3">Go</i>! There’s someone coming!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw Sirius’s face within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the Ministry would get dragged in — he, Harry, would be questioned about Sirius’s whereabouts — </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry heard a tiny  <i class="calibre3">pop</i>! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone. He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at one o’clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped dead facing Harry across the room, and looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who were you talking to?” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that got to do with you?” Harry snarled. “What are you doing down here at this time of night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I just wondered where you —” Ron broke off, shrugging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing. I’m going back to bed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just thought you’d come nosing around, did you?” Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he’d walked in on, knew he hadn’t done it on purpose, but he didn’t care — at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should’ve realized you didn’t want to be disturbed. I’ll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry seized one of the  <i class="calibre3">POTTER REALLY STINKS </i> badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead and bounced off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There you go,” Harry said. “Something for you to wear on  </p>

<p class="calibre1">Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if you’re lucky. . . . That’s what you want, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He strode across the room toward the stairs; he half expected Ron to stop him, he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch at him, but Ron just stood there in his too-small pajamas, and Harry, having stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and didn’t hear him come up to bed. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">arry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inatten-H tively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock. When he’d finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,” she said desperately, “and then we can worry about Karkaroff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 337 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p354"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here, Harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘ <i class="calibre3">Talon-clipping by charms</i> . . .  <i class="calibre3">treating scale-rot</i> . . .’ This is no good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘ <i class="calibre3">Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic</i> <i class="calibre3">that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells</i> <i class="calibre3">can penetrate</i> . . .’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then,” said Harry, throwing aside  <i class="calibre3">Men Who Love Dragons Too Much. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there are Switching Spells . . . but what’s the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous. . . . The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon’s hide. . . . I’d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you real y haven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . unless you’re supposed to put the spell on  <i class="calibre3">yourself </i>? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But  <i class="calibre3">they’re</i> not simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done any of those in class, I only know about them because I’ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will you shut up for a bit, please? I’m trying to concentrate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 338 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p355"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn’t seem to allow room for concentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of  <i class="calibre3">Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping</i> . . . but dragons had no hair . . .  <i class="calibre3">pepper breath</i> . . . that would probably increase a dragon’s firepower . . .  <i class="calibre3">horn tongue</i> . . . just what he needed, to give it an extra weapon . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh no, he’s back  <i class="calibre3">again, </i> why can’t he read on his stupid ship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books. “Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the common room . . . his fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering away. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed past them, one of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts. But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn’t do it. It was the only place he had ever been happy . . . well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn’t remember that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn’t working too well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 339 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons . . . the only champion who didn’t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” Harry said, coming to his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. “Go on, I’ll catch you up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, you’l  be late, the bell’s about to ring —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll catch you up, okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric  was  at  the  top.  He  was  with  a  load  of  sixth-year  friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter’s article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Diffindo</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric’s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor. Several bottles of ink smashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him. “Tell Flitwick I’m coming, go on. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric’s friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of  <i class="calibre3">A Guide to Advanced</i> <i class="calibre3">Transfiguration</i> that was now splattered with ink. “My bag just split . . . brand-new and all . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cedric,” said Harry, “the first task is dragons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 340 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p357"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Cedric, looking up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. “They’ve got four, one for each of us, and we’ve got to get past them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he’d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dead sure,” said Harry. “I’ve seen them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never mind,” said Harry quickly — he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth. “But I’m not the only one who knows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur and Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are you telling me?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn’t have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn’t have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared — well, perhaps Malfoy or Snape . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s just . . . fair, isn’t it?” he said to Cedric. “We all know now . . . we’re on an even footing, aren’t we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric was still looking at him in a slightly suspicious way when Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned around and saw Mad-Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come with me, Potter,” he growled. “Diggory, off you go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 341 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now. What if Moody wanted to know how he’d found out about the dragons? Would Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he’d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,” Moody said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the reaction he had expected at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit down,” said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor Lockhart’s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an Auror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it was much smaller than Moody’s. In the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 342 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” said Moody, who was watching Harry closely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies . . . no use here, of course, too much interference — students in every direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework. Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s extra-sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,” he added in a growl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what’s the mirror for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh that’s my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That’s when I open my trunk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody’s next question brought him sharply back to earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . found out about the dragons, have you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hesitated. He’d been afraid of this — but he hadn’t told Cedric, and he certainly wasn’t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all right,” said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan. “Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 343 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t cheat,” said Harry sharply. “It was — a sort of accident that I found out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody grinned. “I wasn’t accusing you, laddie. I’ve been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won’t be. They’ll have told their champions everything they can. They want to win. They want to beat Dumbledore. They’d like to prove he’s only human.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . got any ideas how you’re going to get past your dragon yet?” said Moody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly. “I don’t show favoritism, me. I’m just going to give you some good, general advice. And the first bit is —  <i class="calibre3">play to your strengths. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me,” growled Moody, “you’ve got strengths if I say you’ve got them. Think now. What are you best at?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry tried to concentrate. What  <i class="calibre3">was</i> he best at? Well, that was easy, really — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all. “You’re a damn good flier from what I’ve heard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but . . .” Harry stared at him. “I’m not allowed a broom, I’ve only got my wand —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My second piece of general advice,” said Moody loudly, interrupting him, “is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to <i class="calibre3">get what you need. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 344 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p361"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on, boy . . .” whispered Moody. “Put them together . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s not that difficult. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Firebolt, he needed — </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her. “Hermione — I need you to help me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">And so they practiced. They didn’t have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him. He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping like stones to the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Concentrate, Harry,  <i class="calibre3">concentrate. </i> . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you think I’m trying to do?” said Harry angrily. “A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay, try again. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 345 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment  meant  that  people  born  in  July  were  in  great  danger  of sudden, violent deaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s good,” said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, “just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to suffer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught Harry’s eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn’t entirely sure that was his prowess at Summoning Charms — perhaps the fly was just stupid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They would have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased. </p>

<p class="calibre1">spell,” Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, “threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. “<i class="calibre3">Accio Dictionary</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt’s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m going to be out there on the grounds. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly “Just as long as you’re concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d better get some sleep . . . you’re going to need it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had left him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons’ enclosure — though of course, they didn’t yet know what they would find there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing “<i class="calibre3">We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potter </i>” as he passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn’t just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch . . . and then (where had the morning </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p364"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">gone? the last of the dragon-free hours?), Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people were watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now. . . . You have to get ready for your first task.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “You’ll be fine!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn’t seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, don’t panic,” she said, “just keep a cool head. . . . We’ve got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” Harry heard himself say. “Yes, I’m fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort  of  voice,  “and  wait  for  your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there . . . he’ll be telling you the — </p>
<p class="calibre1">the procedure. . . . Good luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 348 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p365"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  didn’t  look  nearly  as  composed  as  usual,  but  rather  pale  and clammy. Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking around at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come in, come in, make yourself at home!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in!” said Bagman brightly. “When the audience has assembled, I’m going to be offering each of you this bag” — he held up a smal  sack of purple silk and shook it at them — “from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different — er — varieties, you see. And I have to tell you something else too . . . ah, yes . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">your task is to  <i class="calibre3">collect the golden egg</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood Bagman’s words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn’t reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. . . . Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species. And then — it seemed like </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 349 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p366"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">about a second later to Harry — Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon — a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck. And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn’t even blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish Short-Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there you are!” said Bagman. “You have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have to leave you in a moment, because I’m commentating. Mr. Diggory, you’re first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now . . . Harry . . . could I have a quick word? Outside?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er . . . yes,” said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Harry. “I — no, nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 350 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p367"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got a plan?” said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know. I mean,” Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further, “you’re the underdog here, Harry. . . . Anything I can do to help . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“no — I — I know what I’m going to do, thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nobody would  <i class="calibre3">know, </i> Harry,” said Bagman, winking at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m fine,” said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine. “I’ve got a plan worked out, I —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A whistle had blown somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good lord, I’ve got to run!” said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds later, they heard the roar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now face-to-face with the living counterpart of his model. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and listening. The crowd screamed . . . yelled . . . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as Cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric’s steps, around and around the tent. And Bagman’s commentary made everything much, much worse. . . . Horrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 351 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p368"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” . . . “He’s taking risks, this one!” . . . “<i class="calibre3">Clever</i> move — pity it didn’t work!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting. “And now the marks from the judges!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he didn’t shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One down, three to go!” Bagman yelled as the whistle blew again. “Miss Delacour, if you please!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she left the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other’s gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same process started again. . . . “Oh I’m not sure that was wise!” they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. “Oh . . . nearly! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Careful now . . . good lord, I thought she’d had it then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more. . . . Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while Fleur’s marks were being shown . . . more clapping . . . then, for the third time, the whistle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And here comes Mr. Krum!” cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear . . . yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 352 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very daring!” Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath. “That’s some nerve he’s showing — and — </p>
<p class="calibre1">yes, he’s got the egg!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished — it would be Harry’s turn any moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he’d last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn’t know or care. It was time to do what he had to do . . . to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He raised his wand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Accio Firebolt</i>!” he shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn’t worked . . . if it wasn’t coming . . . He seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 353 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p370"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise. . . . Bagman was shouting something . . . but Harry’s ears were not working properly anymore . . . listening wasn’t important. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd’s faces became mere flesh-colored pinpricks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had left not only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . . He was back where he belonged. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was just another Quidditch match, that was all . . . just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon’s front legs. “Okay,” Harry told himself, “diver-sionary tactics . . . let’s go. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He dived. The Horntail’s head followed him; he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away . . . but Harry didn’t care . . . that was no more than dodging a Bludger. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great Scott, he can fly!” yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped. “Are you watching this, Mr. Krum?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 354 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p371"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">his progress; its head revolving on its long neck — if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy — but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again — </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but this time he was less lucky — he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes — </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be deep. . . . Now he zoomed around the back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred to him. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Horntail didn’t seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs. Though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them . . . but he had to persuade her to do it, or he’d never get near them. . . . The trick was to do it carefully, gradually. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient threat  to  ensure  she  kept  her  eyes  on  him.  Her  head  swayed  this way and that, watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs bared. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He flew higher. The Horntail’s head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before its charmer. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation. He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now. . . . She shot fire into the air, which he dodged. . . . Her jaws opened wide. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 355 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p372"></a>CHAPTER  TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on,” Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“come on, come and get me . . . up you get now . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small airplane — and Harry dived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs — </p>
<p class="calibre1">he had taken his hands off his Firebolt — he had seized the golden egg — </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up — </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at that!” Bagman was yelling. “Will you look at that! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr. Potter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks. . . . He had got through the first task, he had survived. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was excellent, Potter!” cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt — which from her was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder. “You’ll </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 356 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p373"></a>THE  FIRST  TASK </p>
<p class="calibre1">need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score. . . . Over there, she’s had to mop up Diggory already. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh did it, Harry!” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Yeh did it! An’ agains’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie said that was the wors’ —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn’t blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please . . .” said Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while. “Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You’re very lucky . . . this is quite shallow . . . it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, just sit quietly for a minute —  <i class="calibre3">sit</i>! And then you can go and get your score.” </p>
