<p class="calibre1">hrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and T up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blimey,” said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, “if that keeps up the lake’s going to overflow. I’m soak — </p>
<p class="calibre1">ARRGH!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 171 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>CHAPTER  TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto Ron’s head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways into Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped — narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry’s feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped, massaging her throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor McGonagall, straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her square-rimmed spectacles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not doing nothing!” cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifth-year girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. “Already wet, aren’t they? Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!” And he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall call the headmaster!” shouted Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m warning you, Peeves —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 172 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>THE  TRIWIZARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">TOURNAMENT </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wel , move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd. “Into the Great Hall, come on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start-of-term feast. Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair. The four long House tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn’t wobble too much on his partially severed neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water. “Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m starving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 173 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>CHAPTER  TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hiya, Harry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! </p>
<p class="calibre1">My brother Dennis!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — good,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat. “I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione, who was also looking up at the teachers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 174 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>THE  TRIWIZARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">TOURNAMENT </p>
<p class="calibre1">been Professor Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table. There was definitely no new face there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape — Harry’s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry’s loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape’s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under Snape’s overlarge nose — Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Snape’s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall’s. Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons. The tips of Dumbledore’s long, thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced up at the ceiling too. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy. Black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could eat a hippogriff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 175 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>CHAPTER  TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have  swum  across  the  lake  rather than sailed. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school — all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid’s moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it looked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and mouthed,  <i class="calibre3">I fell in the lake</i>! He looked positively delighted about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool on the ground before the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty, patched wizard’s hat. The first years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song: <i class="calibre3">A thousand years or more ago, </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">When I was newly sewn, </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">There lived four wizards of renown, </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Whose names are still well known:</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor, </i> </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">They hatched a daring plan</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">To educate young sorcerers</i> </p>

<p class="calibre1">� 177 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>CHAPTER  TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said Harry, clapping along with everyone else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got to be a pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool,” she told the first years. “When the hat announces your House, you will go and sit at the appropriate table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ackerley, Stewart!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up the Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Baddock, Malcolm!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“SLYTHERIN!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Branstone, Eleanor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HUFFLEPUFF!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 178 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>THE  TRIWIZARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">TOURNAMENT </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cauldwell, Owen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HUFFLEPUFF!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Creevey, Dennis!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table. About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming — a mis-leading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat. “It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly. “It was probably the giant squid, Dennis!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Wow</i>!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and glasses? See him?  <i class="calibre3">Know who he is, Dennis</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 179 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>CHAPTER  TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">fright on their faces moving one by one to the three-legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">joined the Gryffindor table. “We don’t want to break our winning streak, do we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years in a row. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pritchard, Graham!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“SLYTHERIN!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quirke, Orla!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“RAVENCLAW!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!” (“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the Sorting ended. Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the students, his arms opened wide in welcome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep voice echoing around the Hall. “<i class="calibre3">Tuck in. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hear, hear!” said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before their eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione loaded their own plates. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>THE  TRIWIZARD </p>
<p class="calibre1">TOURNAMENT </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaah, ’at’s be’er,” said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed potato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re lucky there’s a feast at al  tonight, you know,” said Nearly Headless Nick. “There was trouble in the kitchens earlier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why? Wha’ ’appened?” said Harry, through a sizable chunk of steak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peeves, of course,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shaking his head, which wobbled dangerously. He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck. “The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast — well, it’s quite out of the question, you know what he’s like, utterly uncivilized, can’t see a plate of food without throwing it. We held a ghost’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains. He was the only person at Hogwarts who could really control Peeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Ron darkly. “So what did he do in the kitchens?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh the usual,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging. “Wreaked havoc and mayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the house-elves out of their wits —” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Clang. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione had knocked over her golden goblet. Pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but Hermione paid no attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are house-elves  <i class="calibre3">here</i>?” she said, staring, horror-struck, at Nearly Headless Nick. “Here at  <i class="calibre3">Hogwarts</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her </p>

<p class="calibre1">reaction. “The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over a hundred.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve never seen one!” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?” said Nearly Headless Nick. “They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning . . . see to the fires and so on. . . . I mean, you’re not supposed to see them, are you? That’s the mark of a good house-elf, isn’t it, that you don’t know it’s there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione stared at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But they get  <i class="calibre3">paid</i>?” she said. “They get  <i class="calibre3">holidays, </i> don’t they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And — and sick leave, and pensions, and everything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff. “House-elves don’t want sick leave and pensions!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits of Yorkshire pudding. “Oops — sorry, ’Arry —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He swallowed. “You won’t get them sick leave by starving yourself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slave labor,” said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s what made this dinner.  <i class="calibre3">Slave labor. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she refused to eat another bite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark glass. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell toward her. “Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that he gave up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet again. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So!” said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. “Now that we are all fed and watered,” (“Hmph!” said Hermione) “I must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The corners of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched. He continued, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As ever, I would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What</i>?” Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing  </p>

<p class="calibre1">soundlessly at Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore went on, “This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and energy — but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black traveling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger, suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling. He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers’ table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A dull  <i class="calibre3">clunk</i> echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached the end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore. Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lightning had thrown the man’s face into sharp relief, and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the nose was missing. But it was the man’s eyes that made him frightening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was mov- </p>

<p class="calibre1">ing ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye — and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man’s head, so that all they could see was whiteness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and Dumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn’t hear. He seemed to be making some in-quiry of the stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his right-hand side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face, pulled a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it. He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat. His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Dumbledore brightly into the silence. “Professor Moody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the staff or students clapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody’s bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moody?” Harry muttered to Ron. “<i class="calibre3">Mad-Eye Moody</i>? The one your dad went to help this morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 185 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>CHAPTER  TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Must be,” said Ron in a low, awed voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What happened to him?” Hermione whispered. “What happened to his  <i class="calibre3">face</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno,” Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore cleared his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I was saying,” he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re JOKING!” said Fred Weasley loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s arrival suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am  <i class="calibre3">not</i> joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some  of  you  wil   not  know  what  this  tournament  involves,  so  I </p>

<p class="calibre1">TOURNAMENT </p>
<p class="calibre1">hope those who  <i class="calibre3">do </i> know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities — until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Death toll </i>?” Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hal ; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very successful. However, our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 187 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>CHAPTER  TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,” he said, “the heads of the participating schools, along  with  the  Ministry  of  Magic,  have  agreed  to  impose  an  age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age — </p>
<p class="calibre1">that is to say, seventeen years or older — will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This” — Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious — “is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.” His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted sup-</p>

<p class="calibre1">port to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chop chop!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. “We’re seventeen in April, why can’t we have a shot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re not stopping me entering,” said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table. “The champions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you’d never be allowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons prize money!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Ron, a faraway look on his face. “Yeah, a thousand Galleons . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on,” said Hermione, “we’ll be the only ones left here if you don’t move.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions are?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 189 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>CHAPTER  TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are. Dumbledore’s trying to stop us giving our names.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People have died, though!” said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago, wasn’t it? Anyway, where’s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get ’round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to enter, wouldn’t it? But I s’pose they might want someone older. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunno if we’ve learned enough. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I definitely haven’t,” came Neville’s gloomy voice from behind Fred and George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though. She’s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have to — oops. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville’s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, </p>

<p class="calibre1">which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Password?” she said as they approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Balderdash,” said George, “a prefect downstairs told me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed. A crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was full of squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry distinctly heard her mutter “<i class="calibre3">Slave labor, </i>” before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">dormitory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower. Five four-poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls,  each  with  its  owner’s trunk at the foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed; Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard, and Dean had tacked up a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of the West Ham football team was pinned right next to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely sta-tionary soccer players. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone — a house-elf, no doubt — had placed warming pans between the sheets. It was extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily through the darkness, “if Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . you never know, do you?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“S’pose not. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind’s eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts champion . . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming . . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cho’s face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn’t see what he could. </p>

<p class="calibre1">he storm had blown itself out by the following morning, T though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast. A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Today’s not bad . . . outside all morning,” said Ron, who was running his finger down the Monday column of his schedule. “Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">damn it, we’re still with the Slytherins. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Double Divination this afternoon,” Harry groaned, looking down. Divination was his least favorite subject, apart from Potions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You  should  have  given  it  up  like me, shouldn’t you?” said </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 193 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>CHAPTER  THIRTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast. “Then you’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re eating again, I notice,” said Ron, watching Hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights,” said Hermione haughtily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah . . . and you were hungry,” said Ron, grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail. Instinctively, Harry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray. The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap — Neville almost always forgot to pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy’s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter? </p>
<p class="calibre1">His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly. “They need squeezing. You will collect the pus —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 194 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>MAD-EYE  MOODY </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  <i class="calibre3">what</i>?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout, “and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles.  Wear  your  dragon-hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork. “An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice. “She tried to curse hers off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sil y  girl,”  said  Professor  Sprout, shaking her head. “But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 195 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>CHAPTER  THIRTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mornin’!” Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be’er wait fer the Slytherins, they won’ want ter miss this — Blast-Ended Skrewts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come again?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid pointed down into the crates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eurgh!” squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eurgh” just about summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Harry’s opinion. They looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small  <i class="calibre3">phut, </i> it would be propelled forward several inches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On’y jus’ hatched,” said Hagrid proudly, “so yeh’ll be able ter raise ’em yerselves! Thought we’d make a bit of a project of it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And why would we  <i class="calibre3">want</i> to raise them?” said a cold voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid looked stumped at the question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, what do they  <i class="calibre3">do</i>?” asked Malfoy. “What is the  <i class="calibre3">point</i> of them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds’ pause, then he said roughly, “Tha’s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus’ feedin’ ’em today. Now, yeh’ll wan’ ter try ’em on a few diff’rent things — I’ve never had ’em before, not sure what they’ll </p>

<p class="calibre1">go fer — I got ant eggs an’ frog livers an’ a bit o’ grass snake — just try ’em out with a bit of each.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First pus and now this,” muttered Seamus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron,  and  Hermione  pick  up  squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Ouch</i>!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes. “It got me! Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said Hagrid, nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eurgh!”  said  Lavender  Brown  again. “Eurgh, Hagrid, what’s that pointy thing on it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, some of ’em have got stings,” said Hagrid enthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box). “I reckon they’re the males. . . . The females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies. . . . I think they might be ter suck blood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep them alive,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Malfoy sarcastical y. “Who wouldn’t want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at once?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just because they’re not very pretty, it doesn’t mean they’re not useful,” Hermione snapped. “Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard. Hagrid would have liked </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>CHAPTER  THIRTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing better than a pet dragon, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew only too well — he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, at least the skrewts are small,” said Ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They are  <i class="calibre3">now, </i>” said Hermione in an exasperated voice, “but once Hagrid’s found out what they eat, I expect they’ll be six feet long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it?” said Ron, grinning slyly at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know perfectly wel  I only said that to shut Malfoy up,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione. “As a matter of fact I think he’s right. The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes. Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er — is this the new stand on elf rights?” said Ron. “You’re going to make yourself puke instead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts. “I just want to get to the library.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">What</i>?” said Ron in disbelief. “Hermione — it’s the first day back! We haven’t even got homework yet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days. Then she leapt to her feet, said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you at dinner!” and departed at high speed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the circular room was bathed in a dim red-dish light cast by the many lamps, which were all draped with scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small circular table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good day,” said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right behind Harry, making him jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him. The usual large amount of beads, chains, and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are preoccupied, my dear,” she said mournfully to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas . . . most difficult . . . I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass . . . and perhaps sooner than you think. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who looked stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs very close to her. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>CHAPTER  THIRTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she said. “The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Harry’s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney’s rambling talks on fortune-telling never held him exactly spell-bound — though he couldn’t help thinking about what she had just said to him. “ ‘ <i class="calibre3">I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass</i> . . .’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud. He wasn’t dreading anything at the moment at all . . . well, unless you counted his fears that Sirius had been caught . . . but what did Professor Trelawney know? He had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortune-telling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the prediction about Voldemort rising again . . . and Dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when Harry had described it to him. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Harry</i>!” Ron muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around; the whole class was staring at him. He sat up straight; he had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn,” said Professor Trelawney, a faint note </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 200 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>MAD-EYE  MOODY </p>
<p class="calibre1">of resentment in her voice at the  fact  that  he  had obviously not been hanging on her words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Born under — what, sorry?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!” said Professor Trelawney, sounding definitely irritated that he wasn’t riveted by this news. “I was saying that Saturn was surely  in  a  position  of  power  in  the heavens at the moment of your birth. . . . Your dark hair . . . your mean stature . . . tragic losses so young in life . . . I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, “I was born in July.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth. It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment, “that can’t be right, can it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney’s mystical whisper, “when two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown — “Oh Professor, look! I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was  </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>CHAPTER  THIRTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">this,  perhaps,  that  made  her  give  them  so  much  homework  at  the end of the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy-fairy self. “I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll take al  weekend, that will. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lots of homework?” said Hermione brightly, catching up with them. “Professor Vector didn’t give  <i class="calibre3">us</i> any at all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, bully for Professor Vector,” said Ron moodily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They reached the entrance hall, which was packed with people queuing for dinner. They had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weasley! Hey, Weasley!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Ron shortly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your dad’s in the paper, Weasley!” said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the  <i class="calibre3">Daily Prophet</i> and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear. “Listen to this! </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems as though the Ministry of Magic’s troubles are not yet at an end,  <i class="calibre3">writes Rita Skeeter, Special</i> <i class="calibre3">Correspondent. </i>  Recently under fire for its poor </p>

<p class="calibre1">crowd control at the Quidditch World Cup, and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches, the Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It’s almost as though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?” he crowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone in the entrance hall was listening now. Malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read on: Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several Muggle law-keepers (“policemen”) over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of “Mad-Eye” Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired from the Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley found, upon arrival at Mr. Moody’s heavily guarded house, that Mr. Moody had once again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen, but refused to answer  <i class="calibre3">Daily</i> <i class="calibre3">Prophet</i> questions about why he had involved the Ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 203 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>CHAPTER  THIRTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up. “A picture of your parents outside their house — if you can call it a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn’t she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get stuffed, Malfoy,” said Harry. “C’mon, Ron. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you, Potter?” sneered Malfoy. “So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know  <i class="calibre3">your</i> mother, Malfoy?” said Harry — both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy — “that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under her nose? Has she always looked like that, or was it just because you were with her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy’s pale face went slightly pink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you dare insult my mother, Potter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep your fat mouth shut, then,” said Harry, turning away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BANG! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several people screamed — Harry felt something white-hot graze the side of his face — he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand, but before he’d even touched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OH NO YOU DON’T, LADDIE!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry spun around. Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase. His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where Malfoy had been standing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a terrified silence in the entrance hall. Nobody but Moody was moving a muscle. Moody turned to look at Harry — </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 204 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>MAD-EYE  MOODY </p>
<p class="calibre1">at least, his normal eye was looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did he get you?” Moody growled. His voice was low and gravelly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Harry, “missed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“LEAVE IT!” Moody shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leave — what?” Harry said, bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not you — him!” Moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Crabbe, who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that Moody’s rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think so!” roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again — it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t like people who attack when their opponent’s back’s turned,” growled Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. “Stinking, cowardly, scummy thing to do. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never — do — that — again —” said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Moody!” said a shocked voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Professor McGonagall,” said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 205 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>CHAPTER  THIRTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What — what are you doing?” said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret’s progress through the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Teaching,” said Moody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Teach — Moody,  <i class="calibre3">is that a student</i>?” shrieked Professor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,” said Moody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moody, we  <i class="calibre3">never</i> use Transfiguration as a punishment!” said Professor McGonagall weakly. “Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly, “but I thought a good sharp shock —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender’s Head of House!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll do that, then,” said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and hu-miliation, looked malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words “my father” were distinguishable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yeah?” said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull   <i class="calibre3">clunk</i> of his wooden leg echoing around the hall. “Well, I know your father of old, boy. . . . You tell him Moody’s keeping a close eye on his son . . . you tell him that from me. . . . Now, your Head of House’ll be Snape, will it?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">� 206 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>MAD-EYE  MOODY </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Malfoy resentfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another old friend,” growled Moody. “I’ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape. . . . Come on, you. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he seized Malfoy’s upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t talk to me,” Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not?” said Hermione in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,” said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face. “Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began dol-ing beef casserole onto each of their plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,” she said. “It was good, really, that Professor McGonagall stopped it —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione!” said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“you’re ruining the best moment of my life!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t tell me you’re going back to the library this evening?” said Harry, watching her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got to,” said Hermione thickly. “Loads to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you told us Professor Vector —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not schoolwork,” she said. Within five minutes, she had  </p>

<p class="calibre1">cleared her plate and departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred Weasley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moody!” he said. “How cool is he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beyond cool,” said George, sitting down opposite Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Supercool,” said the twins’ best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George. “We had him this afternoon,” he told Harry and Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was it like?” said Harry eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never had a lesson like it,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He  <i class="calibre3">knows, </i> man,” said Lee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Knows what?” said Ron, leaning forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Knows what it’s like to be out there  <i class="calibre3">doing</i> it,” said George impressively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doing what?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fighting the Dark Arts,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s seen it all,” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Mazing,” said Lee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron dived into his bag for his schedule. </p>

<p class="calibre1">he next two days passed without great incident, unless you T counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictive-ness over the summer, gave Neville detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disem-bowel a barrel full of horned toads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know why Snape’s in such a foul mood, don’t you?” said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scour-ing Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Harry. “Moody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it — but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the two of them together — at mealtimes, or when they passed in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 209 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>CHAPTER  FOURTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">corridors — he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody’s eye, whether magical or normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I reckon Snape’s a bit scared of him, you know,” Harry said thoughtfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,” said Ron, his eyes misting over, “and bounced him all around his dungeon. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody’s first lesson so much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Been in the —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Library.” Harry finished her sentence for her. “C’mon, quick, or we won’t get decent seats.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher’s desk, took out their copies of  <i class="calibre3">The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, </i> and waited, unusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody’s distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can put those away,” he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting down, “those books. You won’t need them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each student as he or she answered. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>THE  UNFORGIVABLE </p>
<p class="calibre1">CURSES </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right then,” he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, “I’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures — you’ve covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a general murmur of assent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Moody. “So I’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, aren’t you staying?” Ron blurted out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled — the first time Harry had seen him do so. The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said. “Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago. . . . Yeah, I’m staying just the one year. Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet retirement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So — straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I’m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you’re in the sixth year. You’re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher opinion of your nerves, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>CHAPTER  FOURTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you’re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m talking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s magical eye could see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s. Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father  <i class="calibre3">would  </i> know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him — </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron hated spiders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and muttered, “<i class="calibre3">Imperio</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread of silk and </p>

<p class="calibre1">began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone was laughing — everyone except Moody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would you, if I did it to you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The laughter died away almost instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron gave an involuntary shudder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT </p>
<p class="calibre1">VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone jumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody picked up the somersaulting  spider and threw it back into the jar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise, did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked surprised at his own daring. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a small but distinct voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Engorgio</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody’s desk as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, “<i class="calibre3">Crucio</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At once, the spider’s legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop it!” Hermione said shrilly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville’s  </p>

<p class="calibre1">hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody raised his wand. The spider’s legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Reducio, </i>” Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pain,” said Moody softly. “You don’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very popular once too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right . . . anyone know any others?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone’s faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione’s hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” said Moody, looking at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Avada Kedavra, </i>” Hermione whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. “Yes, the last and worst.  <i class="calibre3">Avada Kedavra</i> . . . the Killing Curse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody’s fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Avada Kedavra</i>!” Moody roared. </p>

<p class="calibre1">� 215 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>CHAPTER  FOURTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air — </p>
<p class="calibre1">instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no countercurse. There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s sitting right in front of me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">So that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’ whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How Voldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run . . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry . . . how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son . . . and so  </p>

<p class="calibre1">CURSES </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">voices when he had fought the dementors last year — for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Avada Kedavra’s</i> a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it — you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that doesn’t matter. I’m not here to teach you how to do it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing you?  <i class="calibre3">Because</i> <i class="calibre3">you’ve got to know. </i> You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to find yourself in a situation where you’re facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole class jumped again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now . . . those three curses —  <i class="calibre3">Avada Kedavra, </i> Imperius, and Cruciatus — are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That’s what you’re up against. That’s what I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming.  But  most  of  al ,  you  need  to  practice   <i class="calibre3">constant, never-ceasing</i> <i class="calibre3">vigilance</i>. Get out your quills . . . copy this down. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang — but when  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 217 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>CHAPTER  FOURTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices — “Did you see it twitch?” “— and when he killed it — just like that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn’t found it very entertaining — and nor, it seemed, had Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurry up,” she said tensely to Harry and Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. “Neville.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville?” Hermione said gently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual. “Interesting lesson, wasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m — I’m starving, aren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice. “Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what’s for eating?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron gave Harry a startled look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neville, what — ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>THE  UNFORGIVABLE </p>

<p class="calibre1">“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my office? Come on . . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You all right, are you, Potter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Harry, almost defiantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody’s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry. Then he said, “You’ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, <i class="calibre3">but you’ve got to know. </i> No point pretending . . . well . . . come on, Longbottom, I’ve got some books that might interest you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn’t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was that about?” said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking pensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some lesson, though, eh?” said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall. “Fred and George were right, weren’t they? He really knows his stuff, Moody, doesn’t he? When he did  <i class="calibre3">Avada</i> <i class="calibre3">Kedavra, </i> the way that spider just  <i class="calibre3">died, </i> just snuffed it right —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry’s face and didn’t speak again until they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney’s predictions tonight, since they would take hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron’s conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 219 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>CHAPTER  FOURTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">again. Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we’d seen the curses?” Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, probably,” said Ron. “But Dumbledore’s always done things his way, hasn’t he, and Moody’s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first and asks questions later — look at his dustbins. Balderdash.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed into the Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I s’pose,” Ron groaned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes,” said Neville, “I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He held up the book:  <i class="calibre3">Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really good at Herbology,” Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before. “He thought I’d like this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>THE  UNFORGIVABLE </p>
<p class="calibre1">CURSES </p>
<p class="calibre1">rarely heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron took their copies of  <i class="calibre3">Unfogging the Future</i> back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to mean,” he said, staring down at a long list of calculations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know,” said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old Divination standby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What — make it up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked up at Harry. “You know her — just put in loads of misery, she’ll lap it up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay . . . on Monday,  <i class="calibre3">I</i> will be in danger of — er — burns.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, you will be,” said Ron darkly, “we’re seeing the skrewts again on Monday. Okay, Tuesday,  <i class="calibre3">I’ll</i> . . . erm . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was flicking through  <i class="calibre3">Unfogging the Future</i> for ideas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good one,” said Ron, copying it down.  “Because of . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>CHAPTER  FOURTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">erm . . . Mercury. Why don’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah . . . cool . . .” said Harry, scribbling it down, “because . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Venus is in the twelfth house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And on Wednesday, I think I’ll come off worst in a fight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I’ll lose a bet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They continued to make up predictions (which grew steadily more tragic) for another hour, while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared in-scrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if she knew they weren’t doing their homework properly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn’t yet used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, but it didn’t look like that this time; if it had been, they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched out something with his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that never-</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>THE  UNFORGIVABLE </p>
<p class="calibre1">CURSES </p>
<p class="calibre1">theless carried across the almost deserted room, “No — that sounds like we’re accusing him. Got to be careful . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions — he didn’t want George to think he was eavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other. Crookshanks arched his back, purring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So have I!” said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair, and pulled Ron’s predictions toward her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not going to have a very good month, are you?” she said sar-donically as Crookshanks curled up in her lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah well, at least I’m forewarned,” Ron yawned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions. “I’d better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these up?” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How dare you!” said Ron, in mock outrage. “We’ve been working like house-elves here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione raised her eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s just an expression,” said Ron hastily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his own death by decapitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 223 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>CHAPTER  FOURTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s in the box?” he asked, pointing at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Funny you should ask,” said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She took off the lid and showed them the contents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all bearing the same letters: S.P.E.W. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘Spew’?” said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s this about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not   <i class="calibre3">spew, </i>” said Hermione impatiently. “It’s S-P-E-W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never heard of it,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, of course you haven’t,” said Hermione briskly, “I’ve only just started it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?” said Ron in mild surprise. “How many members have you got?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well — if you two join — three,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘spew,’ do you?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“S-P-E-W!” said Hermione hotly. “I was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status — but it wouldn’t fit. So that’s the heading of our manifesto.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can’t believe no one’s done anything about it before now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hermione — open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They. Like. It. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  <i class="calibre3">like</i> being enslaved!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more  </p>

<p class="calibre1">loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn’t heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they’re shockingly underrepresented.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And how do we do all this?” Harry asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione happily. “I thought two Sickles to join — that buys a badge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign. You’re treasurer, Ron — I’ve got you a collecting tin upstairs — and Harry, you’re secretary, so you might want to write down everything I’m saying now, as a record of our first meeting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on Ron’s face. The silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case looked  as  though  he  was  temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft  <i class="calibre3">tap, tap</i> on the window. Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hedwig!” he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of Harry’s predictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About time!” said Harry, hurrying after her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s got an answer!” said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig’s leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What does it say?” Hermione asked breathlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud: <i class="calibre3">Harry </i>— </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is</i> <i class="calibre3">the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me</i> <i class="calibre3">here.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep</i> <i class="calibre3">your eyes open, Harry. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s flying north?” Hermione whispered. “He’s coming  <i class="calibre3">back</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore’s reading what signs?” said Ron, looking perplexed. “Harry — what’s up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolt-ing Hedwig out of his lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shouldn’t’ve told him!” Harry said furiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you on about?” said Ron in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron’s chair, hooting indignantly. “Coming back, because he thinks I’m in trouble! And there’s nothing wrong with me! And I haven’t got anything for you,” Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, “you’l  have to go up to the Owlery if you want food.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Harry,” Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to bed,” said Harry shortly. “See you in the morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his four-poster, but he didn’t feel remotely tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry’s, fault. Why hadn’t he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds’ pain and he’d had to blab. . . . If he’d just had the sense to keep it to himself. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed. The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that the absence of Neville’s usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake. </p>

<p class="calibre1">arly next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his E mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went back down to the deserted common room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter: <i class="calibre3">Dear Sirius, </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep</i> <i class="calibre3">when I wrote to you last time. There’s no point coming back,</i> <i class="calibre3">everything’s fine here. Don’t worry about me, my head feels</i> <i class="calibre3">completely normal. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large </p>

<p class="calibre1">DURMSTRANG </p>
<p class="calibre1">vase on him halfway along the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just find him, all right?” Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. “Before the dementors do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would or-dinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius’s reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was a  <i class="calibre3">lie, </i> Harry,” said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done. “You  <i class="calibre3">didn’t</i> imagine your scar hurting and you know it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 229 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what?” said Harry. “He’s not going back to Azkaban because of me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drop it,” said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. “You said — to use it against another human was —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. “If you’d rather learn the hard way — when someone’s putting it on you so they can control you completely — </p>
<p class="calibre1">fine by me. You’re excused. Off you go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 230 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>BEAUXBATONS  AND </p>
<p class="calibre1">DURMSTRANG </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potter,” Moody growled, “you next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, “<i class="calibre3">Imperio</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain:  <i class="calibre3">Jump onto the desk</i> . . .  <i class="calibre3">jump</i> <i class="calibre3">onto the desk. </i> . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Jump onto the desk. </i> . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 231 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Jump onto the desk. </i> . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, I don’t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly . . . no, I don’t really want to. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Jump</i>!  <i class="calibre3">NOW </i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping — the result was that he’d smashed headlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,  <i class="calibre3">that’s</i> more like it!” growled Moody’s voice, and suddenly, Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear. He remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look at that, you lot . . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near beat it! We’ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention — watch his eyes, that’s where you see it — very good, Potter, very good indeed! They’ll have trouble controlling <i class="calibre3">you</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The way he talks,” Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse entirely), “you’d think we were all going to be attacked any second.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about paranoid . . .” Ron glanced nervously over his  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1">shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and went on. “No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we’ve got to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!” she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. “Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean Thomas indignantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that  <i class="calibre3">your</i> pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 233 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">the horrors in store for them — but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate. Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their “project,” suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will not,” said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack. “I see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid’s smile faded off his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told,” he growled, “or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor Moody’s book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody’s punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying, </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 234 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>BEAUXBATONS  AND </p>
<p class="calibre1">DURMSTRANG </p>
<p class="calibre1">especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two: </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre5">TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The delegations from Beauxbatons and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Durmstrang will be arriving at 6 o’clock </p>
<p class="calibre1">on Friday the 30th of October. Lessons will end half an hour early — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brilliant!” said Harry. “It’s Potions last thing on Friday! Snape won’t have time to poison us all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Students will return their bags and books to their dormitories and assemble in front of the castle to greet our guests before </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Welcoming Feast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only a week away!” said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff, emerging from the crowd, his eyes gleaming. “I wonder if Cedric knows? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think I’ll go and tell him. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cedric?” said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Diggory,” said Harry. “He must be entering the tournament.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 235 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That idiot, Hogwarts champion?” said Ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s not an idiot. You just don’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,” said Hermione. “I’ve heard he’s a really good student —  <i class="calibre3">and</i> he’s a prefect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She spoke as though this settled the matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You only like him because he’s  <i class="calibre3">handsome, </i>” said Ron scathingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione indignantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Lockhart</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Longbottom, kindly do  <i class="calibre3">not</i> reveal that you can’t even perform a </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 236 � </p>

<p class="calibre1">simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thir-tieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion for Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a bummer, all right,” George was saying gloomily to Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if he won’t talk to us in person, we’ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we’ll stuff it into his hand. He can’t avoid us forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down next to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s a bummer?” Ron asked George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Having a nosy git like you for a brother,” said George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry asked. “Thought any more about trying to enter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 237 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t telling,” said George bitterly.  “She  just  told  me  to  shut  up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonder what the tasks are going to be?” said Ron thoughtfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, I bet we could do them, Harry. We’ve done dangerous stuff before. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they’ve done the tasks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are the judges?” Harry asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,” said Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, “because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had, “It’s all in  <i class="calibre3">Hogwarts, A History. </i> Though, of course, that book’s not  <i class="calibre3">entirely</i> reliable.  <i class="calibre3">A Revised History of Hogwarts</i> would be a more accu-rate title. Or  <i class="calibre3">A Highly Biased and</i> Selective  <i class="calibre3">History of Hogwarts,</i> <i class="calibre3">Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you on about?” said Ron, though Harry thought he knew what was coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">House-elves</i>!” said Hermione, her eyes flashing. “Not once, in over a thousand pages, does  <i class="calibre3">Hogwarts, A History</i> mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His and Ron’s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione’s determination to pursue justice for house-elves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved?” she kept saying fiercely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione from glowering at them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leaned in toward Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, of course not,” said Hermione curtly, “I hardly think students are supposed to —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads of times, to nick food. And we’ve met them, and they’re  <i class="calibre3">happy. </i> They think they’ve got the best job in the world —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s because they’re uneducated and brainwashed!” Hermione began hotly, but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead, which announced the  </p>

<p class="calibre1">arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry’s shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius’s letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Nice try, Harry. </i> </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep</i> <i class="calibre3">me posted on everything that’s going on at Hogwarts.

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Why d’you have to keep changing owls?” Ron asked in a low voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hedwig’ll attract too much attention,” said Hermione at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s hiding . . . I mean, they’re not native birds, are they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get back without being caught was something.  He  couldn’t  deny  either  that  the  idea  that  Sirius  was much  nearer  was  reassuring;  at  least  he  wouldn’t  have  to  wait  so long for a response every time he wrote. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, Hedwig,” he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, </p>

<p class="calibre1">dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the Owlery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Heads of Houses were ordering their students into lines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron. “Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Follow me, please,” said Professor McGonagall. “First years in front . . . no pushing. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already shining over the Forbidden Forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nearly six,” said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates. “How d’you reckon they’re coming? The train?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I doubt it,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How, then? Broomsticks?” Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 241 � </p>

<p class="calibre1">“You can’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to tell you?” said Hermione impatiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold. He wished they’d hurry up. . . . Maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance. . . . He remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the campsite before the Quidditch World Cup: “always the same — we can’t resist showing off when we get together. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">There</i>!” yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something large, much larger than a broomstick — or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks — was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a dragon!” shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be stupid . . . it’s a flying house!” said Dennis Creevey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dennis’s guess was closer. . . . As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 242 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a>BEAUXBATONS  AND </p>
<p class="calibre1">DURMSTRANG </p>
<p class="calibre1">them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palomi-nos, and each the size of an elephant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed — </p>
<p class="calibre1">then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year’s foot, the horses’ hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respect-fully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage — a shoe the size of a child’s sled — </p>
<p class="calibre1">followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. Yet somehow — maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid — this woman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 243 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear Madame Maxime,” he said. “Welcome to Hogwarts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbly-dorr,” said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. “I ’ope I find you well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In excellent form, I thank you,” said Dumbledore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My pupils,” said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From what Harry could see of them (they were standing in Madame Maxime’s enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’As Karkaroff arrived yet?” Madame Maxime asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He should be here any moment,” said Dumbledore. “Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 244 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a>BEAUXBATONS  AND </p>
<p class="calibre1">DURMSTRANG </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Warm up, I think,” said Madame Maxime. “But ze ’orses —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,” said Dumbledore, “the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Skrewts,” Ron muttered to Harry, grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My steeds require — er — forceful ’andling,” said Madame Maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts could be up to the job. “Zey are very strong. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,” said Dumbledore, smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well,” said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. “Will you please inform zis ’Agrid zat ze ’orses drink only single-malt whiskey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will be attended to,” said Dumbledore, also bowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come,” said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How big d’you reckon Durmstrang’s horses are going to be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if they’re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won’t be able to handle them,” said Harry. “That’s if he hasn’t been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder what’s up with them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe they’ve escaped,” said Ron hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh don’t say that,” said Hermione with a shudder. “Imagine that lot loose on the grounds. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive. Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 245 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>CHAPTER  FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime’s huge horses snorting and stamping. But then — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you hear something?” said Ron suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The lake!” yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. “Look at the lake!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water — except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks — and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake’s floor. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">What seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool . . . and then Harry saw the rigging. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a mast!” he said to Ron and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it were a resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great slosh-ing noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank. A few moments later, they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 246 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>BEAUXBATONS  AND </p>
<p class="calibre1">DURMSTRANG </p>
<p class="calibre1">passing the lights in the ship’s portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur. But the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like his hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumbledore!” he called heartily as he walked up the slope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are you, my dear fellow, how are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,” Dumbledore replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like Dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide his rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd. “How good it is to be here, how good. . . . Viktor, come along, into the warmth . . . you don’t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a slight head cold. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He didn’t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harry —  <i class="calibre3">it’s Krum</i>!” </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE GOBLET OF FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t believe it!” Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts I students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. “Krum, Harry!  <i class="calibre3">Viktor Krum</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For heaven’s sake, Ron, he’s only a Quidditch player,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Only a Quidditch player</i>?” Ron said, looking at her as though he couldn’t believe his ears. “Hermione — he’s one of the best Seekers in the world! I had no idea he was still at school!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students heading for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum’s head. Several sixth-year girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked — </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh I don’t believe it, I haven’t got a single quill on me —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’you think he’d sign my hat in lipstick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 248 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Really, </i>” Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now squabbling over the lipstick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I’m</i> getting his autograph if I can,” said Ron. “You haven’t got a quill, have you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope, they’re upstairs in my bag,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down. Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit. The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces. Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not  <i class="calibre3">that</i> cold,” said Hermione defensively. “Why didn’t they bring cloaks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over here! Come and sit over here!” Ron hissed. “Over here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione, budge up, make a space —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too late,” said Ron bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,” said Ron scathingly. “I bet Krum can see right through him, though . . . bet he gets people fawning over him all the time. . . . Where d’you reckon they’re going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory, Harry . . . I wouldn’t mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a camp bed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 249 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermione snorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,” said Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But there are only two extra people,” Harry said. “Why’s Filch putting out four chairs, who else is coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh?” said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet. A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore’s left-hand side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and — most particularly — guests,” said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. “I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 250 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one’s making you stay!” Hermione whispered, bristling at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,” said Dumbledore. “I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The plates in front of them filled with food as usual. The house-elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including several that were definitely foreign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s  <i class="calibre3">that</i>?” said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bouillabaisse,” said Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bless you,” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s  <i class="calibre3">French, </i>” said Hermione, “I had it on holiday summer before last. It’s very nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll take your word for it,” said Ron, helping himself to black pudding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even though there were barely twenty additional students there; perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts’ robes. Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table  </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">� 251 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty minutes after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry, Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?” Harry called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thrivin’,” Hagrid called back happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I’ll just bet they are,” said Ron quietly. “Looks like they’ve finally found a food they like, doesn’t it? Hagrid’s fingers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore’s speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You ’ave finished wiz it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” Ron said breathlessly. “Yeah, it was excellent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before. Harry started to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s a  <i class="calibre3">veela</i>!” he said hoarsely to Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course she isn’t!” said Hermione tartly. “I don’t see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But she wasn’t entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the Hall, many boys’ heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless, just like Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m telling you, that’s not a normal girl!” said Ron, leaning </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 252 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">sideways so he could keep a clear view of her. “They don’t make them like that at Hogwarts!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They make them okay at Hogwarts,” said Harry without thinking. Cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When you’ve both put your eyes back in,” said Hermione briskly, “you’ll be able to see who’s just arrived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty seats had just been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff’s other side, while Mr. Crouch, Percy’s boss, was next to Madame Maxime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are  <i class="calibre3">they</i> doing here?” said Harry in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn’t they?” said Hermione. “I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfa-miliar desserts too. Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible from the Ravenclaw table. The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough, however, and did not come over to get it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats down from them, Fred and George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces. “The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 253 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The what?” Harry muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ron shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—  just  to  clarify  the  procedure  that  we  wil   be  fol owing  this year. But first, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation” — there was a smattering of polite applause — “and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much more likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced. Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in wizard’s robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore’s long white hair and beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions’ efforts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the mention of the word “champions,” the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, “The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked extremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 254 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,” said Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, “and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduc-tion — and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As you know, three champions compete in the tournament,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore went on calmly, “one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,” said Dumbledore. “Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 255 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,” said Dumbledore, “I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is time for bed. Good night to you all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that should be fooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn’t it? And once  your  name’s  in  that  goblet, you’re laughing — it can’t tell whether you’re seventeen or not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I don’t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Hermione, “we just haven’t learned enough . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speak for yourself,” said George shortly. “You’ll try and get in, won’t you, Harry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore’s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled his </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">mind again. . . . He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen  <i class="calibre3">did</i> find a way to get over the Age Line. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is he?” said Ron, who wasn’t listening to a word of this conversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum. “Dumbledore didn’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back to the ship, then,” he was saying. “Viktor, how are you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor,  <i class="calibre3">I</i> vood like some vine,” said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wasn’t offering it to  <i class="calibre3">you, </i> Poliakoff,” snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant. “I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry stopped to let him walk through first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared  at  him  as  though  he  couldn’t  believe  his  eyes.  Behind  their headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a halt too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karkaroff’s eyes moved slowly up Harry’s face and fixed upon his scar. The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 257 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry’s forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, that’s Harry Potter,” said a growling voice from behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The color drained from Karkaroff’s face as Harry watched. A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You!” he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,” said Moody grimly. “And unless you’ve got anything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want to move. You’re blocking the doorway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking over one another’s shoulders to see what was causing the holdup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him. Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 258 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyone put their name in yet?” Ron asked a third-year girl eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All the Durmstrang lot,” she replied. “But I haven’t seen anyone from Hogwarts yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all gone to bed,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said Harry. “I would’ve if it had been me . . . wouldn’t have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Just taken it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Aging Potion, dung brains,” said Fred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One drop each,” said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. “We only need to be a few months older.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,” said Lee, grinning broadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said Hermione warningly “I’m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred, George, and Lee ignored her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?” Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon, then — I’ll go first —” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words  <i class="calibre3">Fred Weasley</i> —  <i class="calibre3">Hogwarts. </i> Fred </p>
<p class="calibre1">� 259 � </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a>CHAPTER  SIXTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a split second Harry thought it had worked — George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred — but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was  a  loud  popping  noise,  and  both  of  them  sprouted  identical long white beards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other’s beards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I did warn you,” said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. “I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from  </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a>THE  GOBLET  OF  FIRE </p>
<p class="calibre1">every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,” Dean told Harry. “That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,” said Seamus contemptuously. “But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in their seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tal  black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, “Well, I’ve done it! Just put my name in!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re kidding!” said Ron, looking impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you seventeen, then?” asked Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ’Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you?” said Ron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had my birthday last week,” said Angelina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’m glad someone from Gryffindor’s entering,” said Hermione. “I really hope you get it, Angelina!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, Hermione,” said Angelina, smiling at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory,” said Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him. </p>
