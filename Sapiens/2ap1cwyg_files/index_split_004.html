<p class="calibre1">James  Cook  was  not  the  rst  explorer  to  think  this  way.  The  Portuguese  and Spanish  voyagers  of  the  fteenth  and  sixteenth  centuries  already  did.  Prince Henry the Navigator and Vasco da Gama explored the coasts of Africa and, while doing  so,  seized  control  of  islands  and  harbours.  Christopher  Columbus</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘discovered’ America and immediately claimed sovereignty over the new lands for the  kings  of  Spain.  Ferdinand  Magellan  found  a  way  around  the  world,  and simultaneously laid the foundation for the Spanish conquest of the Philippines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  time  went  by,  the  conquest  of  knowledge  and  the  conquest  of  territory became ever more tightly intertwined. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, almost every important military expedition that left Europe for distant lands had on  board  scientists  who  set  out  not  to  ght  but  to  make  scienti c  discoveries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Napoleon  invaded  Egypt  in  1798,  he  took  165  scholars  with  him.  Among other  things,  they  founded  an  entirely  new  discipline,  Egyptology,  and  made important contributions to the study of religion, linguistics and botany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1831, the Royal Navy sent the ship HMS  <i class="calibre4">Beagle</i> to map the coasts of South America, the Falklands Islands and the Galapagos Islands. The navy needed this knowledge in order to be better prepared in the event of war. The ship’s captain, who  was  an  amateur  scientist,  decided  to  add  a  geologist  to  the  expedition  to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>study geological  formations  they  might  encounter  on  the  way.  After  several professional  geologists  refused  his  invitation,  the  captain  o ered  the  job  to  a twenty-two-year-old Cambridge graduate, Charles Darwin. Darwin had studied to become an Anglican parson but was far more interested in geology and natural sciences than in the Bible. He jumped at the opportunity, and the rest is history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  captain  spent  his  time  on  the  voyage  drawing  military  maps  while  Darwin collected  the  empirical  data  and  formulated  the  insights  that  would  eventually become the theory of evolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  20  July  1969,  Neil  Armstrong  and  Buzz  Aldrin  landed  on  the  surface  of  the moon.  In  the  months  leading  up  to  their  expedition,  the  <i class="calibre4">Apol o  11</i>  astronauts trained  in  a  remote  moon-like  desert  in  the  western  United  States.  The  area  is home to several Native American communities, and there is a story – or legend –</p>
<p class="calibre1">describing an encounter between the astronauts and one of the locals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  day  as  they  were  training,  the  astronauts  came  across  an  old  Native American.  The  man  asked  them  what  they  were  doing  there.  They  replied  that they were part of a research expedition that would shortly travel to explore the moon. When the old man heard that, he fell silent for a few moments, and then asked the astronauts if they could do him a favour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What do you want?’ they asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,’ said the old man, ‘the people of my tribe believe that holy spirits live on the moon. I was wondering if you could pass an important message to them from my people.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’s the message?’ asked the astronauts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  man  uttered  something  in  his  tribal  language,  and  then  asked  the astronauts to repeat it again and again until they had memorised it correctly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What does it mean?’ asked the astronauts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh, I cannot tell you. It’s a secret that only our tribe and the moon spirits are allowed to know.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">When  they  returned  to  their  base,  the  astronauts  searched  and  searched  until they  found  someone  who  could  speak  the  tribal  language,  and  asked  him  to translate the secret message. When they repeated what they had memorised, the translator  started  to  laugh uproariously.  When  he  calmed  down,  the  astronauts asked  him  what  it  meant.  The  man  explained  that  the  sentence  they  had memorised so carefully said, ‘Don’t believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your lands.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Empty Maps</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a>The  modern  ‘explore  and  conquer’  mentality  is  nicely  illustrated  by  the development  of  world  maps.  Many  cultures  drew  world  maps  long  before  the modern  age.  Obviously,  none  of  them  really  knew  the  whole  of  the  world.  No Afro-Asian  culture  knew  about  America,  and  no  American  culture  knew  about Afro-Asia.  But  unfamiliar  areas  were  simply  left  out,  or  lled  with  imaginary monsters  and  wonders.  These  maps  had  no  empty  spaces.  They  gave  the impression of a familiarity with the entire world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  fteenth  and  sixteenth  centuries,  Europeans  began  to  draw  world maps  with  lots  of  empty  spaces  –  one  indication  of  the  development  of  the scienti c  mindset,  as  well  as  of  the  European  imperial  drive.  The  empty  maps were  a  psychological  and  ideological  breakthrough,  a  clear  admission  that Europeans were ignorant of large parts of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  crucial  turning  point  came  in  1492,  when  Christopher  Columbus  sailed westward from Spain, seeking a new route to East Asia. Columbus still believed in the  old  ‘complete’  world  maps.  Using  them,  Columbus  calculated  that  Japan should have been located about 7,000 kilometres west of Spain. In fact, more than 20,000  kilometres  and  an  entire  unknown  continent  separate  East  Asia  from Spain.  On  12  October  1492,  at  about  2:00  a.m.,  Columbus’  expedition  collided with the unknown continent. Juan Rodriguez Bermejo, watching from the mast of the  ship  <i class="calibre4">Pinta</i>, spotted an island in what we now call the Bahamas, and shouted</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Land! Land!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Columbus believed he had reached a small island o  the East Asian coast. He called the people he found there ‘Indians’ because he thought he had landed in the Indies  –  what  we  now  call  the  East  Indies  or  the  Indonesian  archipelago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Columbus stuck to this error for the rest of his life. The idea that he had discovered a completely unknown continent was inconceivable for him and for many of his generation. For thousands of years, not only the greatest thinkers and scholars but also the infallible Scriptures had known only Europe, Africa and Asia. Could they all have been wrong? Could the Bible have missed half the world? It would be as if in 1969, on its way to the moon,  <i class="calibre4">Apol o 11</i> had crashed into a hitherto unknown moon  circling  the  earth,  which  all  previous  observations  had  somehow  failed  to spot.  In  his  refusal  to  admit  ignorance,  Columbus  was  still  a  medieval  man.  He was  convinced  he  knew  the  whole  world,  and  even  his  momentous  discovery failed to convince him otherwise. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a><img src="index-246_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p368"><b class="calibre3">36. </b></a><b class="calibre3">A European world map from 1459 (Europe is in the top left corner). The map is filled with details,</b> <b class="calibre3">even when depicting areas that were completely unfamiliar to Europeans, such as southern Africa</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst modern man was Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian sailor who took part in several expeditions to America in the years 1499–1504. Between 1502 and 1504, two  texts  describing  these  expeditions  were  published  in  Europe.  They  were attributed  to  Vespucci.  These  texts  argued  that  the  new  lands  discovered  by Columbus were not islands o  the East Asian coast, but rather an entire continent unknown to the Scriptures, classical geographers and contemporary Europeans. In 1507,  convinced  by  these  arguments,  a  respected  mapmaker  named  Martin Waldseemüller published an updated world map, the  rst to show the place where Europe’s  westward-sailing  eets  had  landed  as  a  separate  continent.  Having drawn  it,  Waldseemüller  had  to  give  it  a  name.  Erroneously  believing  that Amerigo Vespucci had been the person who discovered it, Waldseemüller named the  continent  in  his  honour  –  America.  The  Waldseemüller  map  became  very popular and was copied by many other cartographers, spreading the name he had given the new land. There is poetic justice in the fact that a quarter of the world, and two of its seven continents, are named after a little-known Italian whose sole</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a><img src="index-247_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">claim to fame is that he had the courage to say, ‘We don’t know.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  discovery  of  America  was  the  foundational  event  of  the  Scienti c Revolution. It not only taught Europeans to favour present observations over past traditions, but the desire to conquer America also obliged Europeans to search for new knowledge at breakneck speed. If they really wanted to control the vast new territories,  they  had  to  gather  enormous  amounts  of  new  data  about  the geography,  climate,  ora,  fauna,  languages,  cultures  and  history  of  the  new continent.  Christian  Scriptures,  old  geography  books  and  ancient  oral  traditions were of little help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henceforth not only European geographers, but European scholars in almost all other  elds  of  knowledge  began  to  draw  maps  with  spaces  left  to  ll  in.  They began to admit that their theories were not perfect and that there were important things that they did not know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Europeans  were  drawn  to  the  blank  spots  on  the  map  as  if  they  were magnets, and promptly started  lling them in. During the  fteenth and sixteenth centuries,  European  expeditions  circumnavigated  Africa,  explored  America, crossed  the  Paci c  and  Indian  Oceans,  and  created  a  network  of  bases  and colonies  all  over  the  world.  They  established  the  rst  truly  global  empires  and knitted together the  rst global trade network. The European imperial expeditions transformed the history of the world: from being a series of histories of isolated peoples and cultures, it became the history of a single integrated human society. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p368"><b class="calibre3">37. </b></a><b class="calibre3"> The Salviati World Map, 1525. While the 1459 world map is full of continents, islands and detailed</b> <b class="calibre3">explanations, the Salviati map is mostly empty. The eye wanders south along the American coastline,</b> <b class="calibre3">until it peters into emptiness. Anyone looking at the map and possessing even minimal curiosity is</b> <b class="calibre3">tempted to ask, ‘What’s beyond this point?’ The map gives no answers. It invites the observer to set sail</b> <b class="calibre3">and find out</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>These European explore-and-conquer expeditions are so familiar to us that we tend  to  overlook  just  how  extraordinary  they  were.  Nothing  like  them  had  ever happened  before.  Long-distance  campaigns  of  conquest  are  not  a  natural undertaking.  Throughout  history  most  human  societies  were  so  busy  with  local con icts  and  neighbourhood  quarrels  that  they  never  considered  exploring  and conquering  distant  lands.  Most  great  empires  extended  their  control  only  over their  immediate  neighbourhood  –  they  reached  far- ung  lands  simply  because their neighbourhood kept expanding. Thus the Romans conquered Etruria in order to  defend  Rome  ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.350–300 BC).  They  then  conquered  the  Po  Valley  in  order  to defend Etruria ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.200 BC). They subsequently conquered Provence to defend the Po Valley ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.120 BC), Gaul to defend Provence ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.50 BC), and Britain in order to defend Gaul ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>. AD 50). It took them 400 years to get from Rome to London. In 350 BC, no Roman would have conceived of sailing directly to Britain and conquering it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occasionally an ambitious ruler or adventurer would embark on a long-range</p>
<p class="calibre1">campaign of conquest, but such campaigns usually followed well-beaten imperial or commercial paths. The campaigns of Alexander the Great, for example, did not result  in  the  establishment  of  a  new  empire,  but  rather  in  the  usurpation  of  an existing  empire  –  that  of  the  Persians.  The  closest  precedents  to  the  modern European empires were the ancient naval empires of Athens and Carthage, and the medieval naval empire of Majapahit, which held sway over much of Indonesia in the fourteenth century. Yet even these empires rarely ventured into unknown seas – their naval exploits were local undertakings when compared to the global ventures of the modern Europeans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many scholars argue that the voyages of Admiral Zheng He of the Chinese Ming dynasty heralded and eclipsed the European voyages of discovery. Between 1405</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  1433,  Zheng  led  seven  huge  armadas  from  China  to  the  far  reaches  of  the Indian Ocean. The largest of these comprised almost 300 ships and carried close to 30,000 people. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">7 </a>They visited Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea  and  East  Africa.  Chinese  ships  anchored  in  Jedda,  the  main  harbour  of  the Hejaz,  and  in  Malindi,  on  the  Kenyan  coast.  Columbus’  eet  of  1492  –  which consisted  of  three  small  ships  manned  by  120  sailors  –  was  like  a  trio  of mosquitoes compared to Zheng He’s drove of dragons. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet there was a crucial di erence. Zheng He explored the oceans, and assisted pro-Chinese  rulers,  but  he  did  not  try  to  conquer  or  colonise  the  countries  he visited. Moreover, the expeditions of Zheng He were not deeply rooted in Chinese politics and culture. When the ruling faction in Beijing changed during the 1430s, the  new  overlords  abruptly  terminated  the  operation.  The  great  eet  was dismantled,  crucial  technical  and  geographical  knowledge  was  lost,  and  no explorer  of  such  stature  and  means  ever  set  out  again  from  a  Chinese  port. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a><img src="index-249_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Chinese  rulers  in  the  coming  centuries,  like  most  Chinese  rulers  in  previous centuries,  restricted  their  interests  and  ambitions  to  the  Middle  Kingdom’s immediate environs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Zheng  He  expeditions  prove  that  Europe  did  not  enjoy  an  outstanding technological edge. What made Europeans exceptional was their unparalleled and insatiable  ambition  to  explore  and  conquer.  Although  they  might  have  had  the ability, the Romans never attempted to conquer India or Scandinavia, the Persians never  attempted  to  conquer  Madagascar  or  Spain,  and  the  Chinese  never attempted  to  conquer  Indonesia  or  Africa.  Most  Chinese  rulers  left  even  nearby Japan  to  its  own  devices.  There  was  nothing  peculiar  about  that.  The  oddity  is that early modern Europeans caught a fever that drove them to sail to distant and completely unknown lands full of alien cultures, take one step on to their beaches, and immediately declare, ‘I claim all these territories for my king!’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p368"><b class="calibre3">38. </b></a><b class="calibre3">Zheng He’s flagship next to that of Columbus</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Invasion from Outer Space</p>
<p class="calibre1">Around  1517,  Spanish  colonists  in  the  Caribbean  islands  began  to  hear  vague rumours  about  a  powerful  empire  somewhere  in  the  centre  of  the  Mexican mainland. A mere four years later, the Aztec capital was a smouldering ruin, the Aztec Empire was a thing of the past, and Hernán Cortés lorded over a vast new</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>Spanish Empire in Mexico. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Spaniards  did  not  stop  to  congratulate  themselves  or  even  to  catch  their breath.  They  immediately  commenced  explore-and-conquer  operations  in  all directions.  The  previous  rulers  of  Central  America  –  the  Aztecs,  the  Toltecs,  the Maya  –  barely  knew  South  America  existed,  and  never  made  any  attempt  to subjugate it, over the course of 2,000 years. Yet within little more than ten years of  the  Spanish  conquest  of  Mexico,  Francisco  Pizarro  had  discovered  the  Inca Empire in South America, vanquishing it in 1532. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had the Aztecs and Incas shown a bit more interest in the world surrounding them – and had they known what the Spaniards had done to their neighbours –</p>
<p class="calibre1">they might have resisted the Spanish conquest more keenly and successfully. In the years separating Columbus’  rst journey to America (1492) from the landing of Cortés in Mexico (1519), the Spaniards conquered most of the Caribbean islands, setting up a chain of new colonies. For the subjugated natives, these colonies were hell  on  earth.  They  were  ruled  with  an  iron  st  by  greedy  and  unscrupulous colonists  who  enslaved  them  and  set  them  to  work  in  mines  and  plantations, killing anyone who o ered the slightest resistance. Most of the native population soon died, either because of the harsh working conditions or the virulence of the diseases  that  hitch-hiked  to  America  on  the  conquerors’  sailing  ships.  Within twenty years, almost the entire native Caribbean population was wiped out. The Spanish colonists began importing African slaves to fill the vacuum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This genocide took place on the very doorstep of the Aztec Empire, yet when Cortés landed on the empire’s eastern coast, the Aztecs knew nothing about it. The coming of the Spaniards was the equivalent of an alien invasion from outer space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Aztecs were convinced that they knew the entire world and that they ruled most  of  it.  To  them  it  was  unimaginable  that  outside  their  domain  could  exist anything  like  these  Spaniards.  When  Cortés  and  his  men  landed  on  the  sunny beaches  of  today’s  Vera  Cruz,  it  was  the  rst  time  the  Aztecs  encountered  a completely unknown people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Aztecs  did  not  know  how  to  react.  They  had  trouble  deciding  what  these strangers were. Unlike all known humans, the aliens had white skins. They also had lots of facial hair. Some had hair the colour of the sun. They stank horribly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Native  hygiene  was  far  better  than  Spanish  hygiene.  When  the  Spaniards  rst arrived in Mexico, natives bearing incense burners were assigned to accompany them wherever they went. The Spaniards thought it was a mark of divine honour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We know from native sources that they found the newcomers’ smell unbearable.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a><img src="index-251_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Map 7. The Aztec and Inca empires at the time of the Spanish conquest</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  aliens’  material  culture  was  even  more  bewildering.  They  came  in  giant ships, the like of which the Aztecs had never imagined, let alone seen. They rode on the back of huge and terrifying animals, swift as the wind. They could produce lightning  and  thunder  out  of  shiny  metal  sticks.  They  had  ashing  long  swords and  impenetrable  armour,  against  which  the  natives’  wooden  swords  and  int spears were useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some Aztecs thought these must be gods. Others argued that they were demons, or  the  ghosts  of  the  dead,  or  powerful  sorcerers.  Instead  of  concentrating  all available  forces  and  wiping  out  the  Spaniards,  the  Aztecs  deliberated,  dawdled and negotiated. They saw no reason to rush. After all, Cortés had no more than 550 Spaniards with him. What could 550 men do to an empire of millions? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cortés  was  equally  ignorant  about  the  Aztecs,  but  he  and  his  men  held signi cant advantages over their adversaries. While the Aztecs had no experience to prepare them for the arrival of these strange-looking and foul-smelling aliens, the Spaniards knew that the earth was full of unknown human realms, and no one had  greater  expertise  in  invading  alien  lands  and  dealing  with  situations  about which  they  were  utterly  ignorant.  For  the  modern  European  conqueror,  like  the modern European scientist, plunging into the unknown was exhilarating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So when Cortés anchored o  that sunny beach in July 1519, he did not hesitate</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>to act. Like a science- ction alien emerging from his spaceship, he declared to the awestruck  locals:  ‘We  come  in  peace.  Take  us  to  your  leader.’  Cortés  explained that  he  was  a  peaceful  emissary  from  the  great  king  of  Spain,  and  asked  for  a diplomatic interview with the Aztec ruler, Montezuma II. (This was a shameless lie. Cortés led an independent expedition of greedy adventurers. The king of Spain had never heard of Cortés, nor of the Aztecs.) Cortés was given guides, food and some military assistance by local enemies of the Aztecs. He then marched towards the Aztec capital, the great metropolis of Tenochtitlan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Aztecs  allowed  the  aliens  to  march  all  the  way  to  the  capital,  then respectfully led the aliens’ leader to meet Emperor Montezuma. In the middle of the  interview,  Cortés  gave  a  signal,  and  steel-armed  Spaniards  butchered Montezuma’s  bodyguards  (who  were  armed  only  with  wooden  clubs,  and  stone blades). The honoured guest took his host prisoner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cortés was now in a very delicate situation. He had captured the emperor, but was surrounded by tens of thousands of furious enemy warriors, millions of hostile civilians,  and  an  entire  continent  about  which  he  knew  practically  nothing.  He had  at  his  disposal  only  a  few  hundred  Spaniards,  and  the  closest  Spanish reinforcements were in Cuba, more than 1,500 kilometres away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cortés  kept  Montezuma  captive  in  the  palace,  making  it  look  as  if  the  king remained  free  and  in  charge  and  as  if  the  ‘Spanish  ambassador’  were  no  more than  a  guest.  The  Aztec  Empire  was  an  extremely  centralised  polity,  and  this unprecedented  situation  paralysed  it. Montezuma  continued  to  behave  as  if  he ruled  the  empire,  and  the  Aztec  elite  continued  to  obey  him,  which  meant  they obeyed Cortés. This situation lasted for several months, during which time Cortés interrogated  Montezuma  and  his  attendants,  trained  translators  in  a  variety  of local  languages,  and  sent  small  Spanish  expeditions  in  all  directions  to  become familiar  with  the  Aztec  Empire  and  the  various  tribes,  peoples  and  cities  that  it ruled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Aztec  elite  eventually  revolted  against  Cortés  and  Montezuma,  elected  a new  emperor,  and  drove  the  Spaniards  from  Tenochtitlan.  However,  by  now numerous cracks had appeared in the imperial edi ce. Cortés used the knowledge he had gained to prise the cracks open wider and split the empire from within. He convinced  many  of  the  empire’s  subject  peoples  to  join  him  against  the  ruling Aztec  elite.  The  subject  peoples  miscalculated  badly.  They  hated  the  Aztecs,  but knew  nothing  of  Spain  or  the  Caribbean  genocide.  They  assumed  that  with Spanish help they could shake o  the Aztec yoke. The idea that the Spanish would take  over  never  occurred  to  them.  They  were  sure  that  if  Cortés  and  his  few hundred  henchmen  caused  any  trouble,  they  could  easily  be  overwhelmed.  The rebellious  peoples  provided  Cortés  with  an  army  of  tens  of  thousands  of  local troops, and with its help Cortés besieged Tenochtitlan and conquered the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p253"></a>At  this  stage  more  and  more  Spanish  soldiers  and  settlers  began  arriving  in Mexico, some from Cuba, others all the way from Spain. When the local peoples realised what was happening, it was too late. Within a century of the landing at Vera Cruz, the native population of the Americas had shrunk by about 90 per cent, due  mainly  to  unfamiliar  diseases  that  reached  America  with  the  invaders.  The survivors  found  themselves  under  the  thumb  of  a  greedy  and  racist  regime  that was far worse than that of the Aztecs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten years after Cortés landed in Mexico, Pizarro arrived on the shore of the Inca Empire. He had far fewer soldiers than Cortés – his expedition numbered just 168</p>
<p class="calibre1">men!  Yet  Pizarro  bene ted  from  all  the  knowledge  and  experience  gained  in previous  invasions.  The  Inca,  in  contrast,  knew  nothing  about  the  fate  of  the Aztecs. Pizarro plagiarised Cortés. He declared himself a peaceful emissary from the  king  of  Spain,  invited  the  Inca  ruler,  Atahualpa,  to  a  diplomatic  interview, and then kidnapped him. Pizarro proceeded to conquer the paralysed empire with the help of local allies. If the subject peoples of the Inca Empire had known the fate of the inhabitants of Mexico, they would not have thrown in their lot with the invaders. But they did not know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The native peoples of America were not the only ones to pay a heavy price for their parochial outlook. The great empires of Asia – the Ottoman, the Safavid, the Mughal and the Chinese – very quickly heard that the Europeans had discovered something  big.  Yet  they  displayed  little  interest  in  these  discoveries.  They continued to believe that the world revolved around Asia, and made no attempt to compete with the Europeans for control of America or of the new ocean lanes in the Atlantic and the Paci c. Even puny European kingdoms such as Scotland and Denmark  sent  a  few  explore-and-conquer  expeditions  to  America,  but  not  one expedition  of  either  exploration  or  conquest  was  ever  sent  to  America  from  the Islamic world, India or China. The  rst non-European power that tried to send a military expedition to America was Japan. That happened in June 1942, when a Japanese expedition conquered Kiska and Attu, two small islands o  the Alaskan coast, capturing in the process ten US soldiers and a dog. The Japanese never got any closer to the mainland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is hard to argue that the Ottomans or Chinese were too far away, or that they lacked  the  technological,  economic  or  military  wherewithal.  The  resources  that sent Zheng He from China to East Africa in the 1420S should have been enough to reach America. The Chinese just weren’t interested. The  rst Chinese world map to show America was not issued until 1602 – and then by a European missionary! </p>
<p class="calibre1">For 300 years, Europeans enjoyed undisputed mastery in America and Oceania, in the Atlantic and the Paci c. The only signi cant struggles in those regions were between di erent European powers. The wealth and resources accumulated by the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a>Europeans  eventually  enabled  them  to  invade  Asia  too,  defeat  its  empires,  and divide  it  among  themselves.  When  the  Ottomans,  Persians,  Indians  and  Chinese woke up and began paying attention, it was too late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  in  the  twentieth  century  did  non-European  cultures  adopt  a  truly  global vision.  This  was  one  of  the  crucial  factors  that  led  to the  collapse  of  European hegemony.  Thus  in  the  Algerian  War  of  Independence  (1954–62),  Algerian guerrillas defeated a French army with an overwhelming numerical, technological and economic advantage. The Algerians prevailed because they were supported by a global anti-colonial network, and because they worked out how to harness the world’s media to their cause – as well as public opinion in France itself. The defeat that little North Vietnam in icted on the American colossus was based on a similar strategy. These guerrilla forces showed that even superpowers could be defeated if a local struggle became a global cause. It is interesting to contemplate what might have happened had Montezuma been able to manipulate public opinion in Spain and gain assistance from one of Spain’s rivals – Portugal, France or the Ottoman Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rare Spiders and Forgotten Scripts</p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern science and modern empires were motivated by the restless feeling that perhaps something important awaited beyond the horizon – something they had better explore and master. Yet the connection between science and empire went much  deeper.  Not  just  the  motivation,  but  also  the  practices  of  empire-builders were  entangled  with  those  of  scientists.  For  modern  Europeans,  building  an empire  was  a  scienti c  project,  while  setting  up  a  scienti c  discipline  was  an imperial project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Muslims conquered India, they did not bring along archaeologists to systematically  study  Indian  history,  anthropologists  to  study  Indian  cultures, geologists  to  study  Indian  soils,  or  zoologists  to  study  Indian  fauna.  When  the British conquered India, they did all of these things. On 10 April 1802 the Great Survey  of  India  was  launched.  It  lasted  sixty  years.  With  the  help  of  tens  of thousands of native labourers, scholars and guides, the British carefully mapped the  whole  of  India,  marking  borders,  measuring  distances,  and  even  calculating for  the  rst  time  the  exact  height  of  Mount  Everest  and  the  other  Himalayan peaks.  The  British  explored  the  military  resources  of  Indian  provinces  and  the location of their gold mines, but they also took the trouble to collect information about rare Indian spiders, to catalogue colourful butter ies, to trace the ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a>origins of extinct Indian languages, and to dig up forgotten ruins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mohenjo-daro was one of the chief cities of the Indus Valley civilisation, which ourished in the third millennium BC and was destroyed around 1900 BC. None of India’s  pre-British  rulers  –  neither  the  Mauryas,  nor  the  Guptas,  nor  the  Delhi sultans, nor the great Mughals – had given the ruins a second glance. But a British archaeological  survey  took  notice  of  the  site  in  1922.  A  British  team  then excavated it, and discovered the  rst great civilisation of India, which no Indian had been aware of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  telling  example  of  British  scienti c  curiosity  was  the  deciphering  of cuneiform  script.  This  was  the  main  script  used  throughout  the  Middle  East  for close to 3,000 years, but the last person able to read it probably died sometime in the  early  rst  millennium AD.  Since  then,  inhabitants  of  the  region  frequently encountered  cuneiform  inscriptions  on  monuments,  steles,  ancient  ruins  and broken pots. But they had no idea how to read the weird, angular scratches and, as  far  as  we  know,  they  never  tried.  Cuneiform  came  to  the  attention  of Europeans in 1618, when the Spanish ambassador in Persia went sightseeing in the  ruins  of  ancient  Persepolis,  where  he  saw  inscriptions  that  nobody  could explain to him. News of the unknown script spread among European savants and piqued their curiosity. In 1657 European scholars published the  rst transcription of a cuneiform text from Persepolis. More and more transcriptions followed, and for  close  to  two  centuries  scholars  in  the  West  tried  to  decipher  them.  None succeeded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  1830s,  a  British  o cer  named  Henry  Rawlinson  was  sent  to  Persia  to help the shah train his army in the European style. In his spare time Rawlinson travelled around Persia and one day he was led by local guides to a cli  in the Zagros Mountains and shown the huge Behistun Inscription. About  fteen metres high and twenty- ve metres wide, it had been etched high up on the cli  face on the  command  of  King  Darius  I  sometime  around  500 BC.  It  was  written  in cuneiform  script  in  three  languages:  Old  Persian,  Elamite  and  Babylonian.  The inscription  was  well  known  to  the  local  population,  but  nobody  could  read  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rawlinson became convinced that if he could decipher the writing it would enable him and other scholars to read the numerous inscriptions and texts that were at the time being discovered all over the Middle East, opening a door into an ancient and forgotten world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst  step  in  deciphering  the  lettering  was  to  produce  an  accurate transcription that could be sent back to Europe. Rawlinson de ed death to do so, scaling the steep cli  to copy the strange letters. He hired several locals to help him, most notably a Kurdish boy who climbed to the most inaccessible parts of the cli  in order to copy the upper portion of the inscription. In 1847 the project was completed, and a full and accurate copy was sent to Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>Rawlinson did not rest on his laurels. As an army o cer, he had military and political missions to carry out, but whenever he had a spare moment he puzzled over the secret script. He tried one method after another and  nally managed to decipher  the  Old  Persian  part  of  the  inscription.  This  was  easiest,  since  Old Persian was not that di erent from modern Persian, which Rawlinson knew well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An understanding of the Old Persian section gave him the key he needed to unlock the secrets of the Elamite and Babylonian sections. The great door swung open, and out came a rush of ancient but lively voices – the bustle of Sumerian bazaars, the  proclamations  of  Assyrian  kings,  the  arguments  of  Babylonian  bureaucrats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without the e orts of modern European imperialists such as Rawlinson, we would not have known much about the fate of the ancient Middle Eastern empires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another notable imperialist scholar was William Jones. Jones arrived in India in September 1783 to serve as a judge in the Supreme Court of Bengal. He was so captivated by the wonders of India that within less than six months of his arrival he  had  founded  the  Asiatic  Society.  This  academic  organisation  was  devoted  to studying  the  cultures,  histories  and  societies  of  Asia,  and  in  particular  those  of India.  Within  two  years  Jones  published  his  observations  on  the  Sanskrit language, which pioneered the science of comparative linguistics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  his  publications  Jones  pointed  out  surprising  similarities  between  Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language that became the sacred tongue of Hindu ritual, and the Greek and Latin languages, as well as similarities between all these languages and  Gothic,  Celtic,  Old  Persian,  German,  French  and  English.  Thus  in  Sanskrit, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘mother’  is  ‘ <i class="calibre4">matar</i>’,  in  Latin  it  is  ‘ <i class="calibre4">mater</i>’,  and  in  Old  Celtic  it  is  ‘ <i class="calibre4">mathir</i>’.  Jones surmised that all these languages must share a common origin, developing from a now-forgotten ancient ancestor. He was thus the  rst to identify what later came to be called the Indo-European family of languages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jones’  study  was  an  important  milestone  not  merely  due  to  his  bold  (and accurate)  hypotheses,  but  also  because  of  the  orderly  methodology  that  he developed to compare languages. It was adopted by other scholars, enabling them systematically to study the development of all the world’s languages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Linguistics  received  enthusiastic  imperial  support.  The  European  empires believed  that  in  order  to  govern  e ectively  they  must  know  the  languages  and cultures of their subjects. British o cers arriving in India were supposed to spend up to three years in a Calcutta college, where they studied Hindu and Muslim law alongside English law; Sanskrit, Urdu and Persian alongside Greek and Latin; and Tamil,  Bengali  and  Hindustani  culture  alongside  mathematics,  economics  and geography. The study of linguistics provided invaluable help in understanding the structure and grammar of local languages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks  to  the  work  of  people  like  William  Jones  and  Henry  Rawlinson,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>European conquerors knew their empires very well. Far better, indeed, than any previous  conquerors,  or  even  than  the  native  population  itself.  Their  superior knowledge  had  obvious  practical  advantages.  Without  such  knowledge,  it  is unlikely  that  a  ridiculously  small  number  of  Britons  could  have  succeeded  in governing, oppressing and exploiting so many hundreds of millions of Indians for two  centuries.  Throughout  the  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries,  fewer than  5,000  British  o cials,  about  40,000–70,000  British  soldiers,  and  perhaps another  100,000  British  business  people,  hangers-on,  wives  and  children  were sufficient to conquer and rule up to 300 million Indians. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet these practical advantages were not the only reason why empires  nanced the study of linguistics, botany, geography and history. No less important was the fact  that  science  gave  the  empires ideological  justi cation.  Modern  Europeans came to believe that acquiring new knowledge was always good. The fact that the empires  produced  a  constant  stream  of  new  knowledge  branded  them  as progressive  and  positive  enterprises.  Even  today,  histories  of  sciences  such  as geography, archaeology and botany cannot avoid crediting the European empires, at least indirectly. Histories of botany have little to say about the su ering of the Aboriginal Australians, but they usually  nd some kind words for James Cook and Joseph Banks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, the new knowledge accumulated by the empires made it possible, at  least  in  theory,  to  bene t  the  conquered  populations  and  bring  them  the bene ts  of  ‘progress’  –  to  provide  them  with  medicine  and  education,  to  build railroads  and  canals,  to  ensure  justice  and  prosperity.  Imperialists  claimed  that their  empires  were  not  vast  enterprises  of  exploitation  but  rather  altruistic projects conducted for the sake of the non-European races – in Rudyard Kipling’s words, ‘the White Man’s burden’:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take up the White Man’s burden –</p>
<p class="calibre1">Send forth the best ye breed –</p>
<p class="calibre1">Go bind your sons to exile</p>
<p class="calibre1">To serve your captives’ need; </p>
<p class="calibre1">To wait in heavy harness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">On fluttered folk and wild –</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your new-caught, sul en peoples, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half-devil and half-child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  course,  the  facts  often  belied  this  myth.  The  British  conquered  Bengal,  the richest province of India, in 1764. The new rulers were interested in little except enriching themselves. They adopted a disastrous economic policy that a few years later led to the outbreak of the Great Bengal Famine. It began in 1769, reached</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a>catastrophic  levels  in  1770,  and  lasted  until  1773.  About  10  million  Bengalis,  a third of the province’s population, died in the calamity. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">10</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In truth, neither the narrative of oppression and exploitation nor that of ‘The White Man’s Burden’ completely matches the facts. The European empires did so many di erent things on such a large scale, that you can  nd plenty of examples to  support  whatever  you  want to  say  about  them.  You  think  that  these  empires were  evil  monstrosities  that  spread  death,  oppression  and  injustice  around  the world? You could easily  ll an encyclopedia with their crimes. You want to argue that  they  in  fact  improved  the  conditions  of  their  subjects  with  new  medicines, better  economic  conditions  and  greater  security?  You  could  ll  another encyclopedia with their achievements. Due to their close cooperation with science, these empires wielded so much power and changed the world to such an extent that  perhaps  they  cannot  be  simply  labelled  as  good  or  evil.  They  created  the world as we know it, including the ideologies we use in order to judge them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  science  was  also  used  by  imperialists  to  more  sinister  ends.  Biologists, anthropologists  and  even  linguists  provided  scienti c  proof  that  Europeans  are superior  to  all  other  races,  and  consequently  have  the  right  (if  not  perhaps  the duty)  to  rule  over  them.  After  William  Jones  argued  that  all  Indo-European languages descend from a single ancient language many scholars were eager to discover  who  the  speakers  of  that  language  had  been.  They  noticed  that  the earliest  Sanskrit  speakers,  who  had  invaded  India  from  Central  Asia  more  than 3,000 years ago, had called themselves Arya. The speakers of the earliest Persian language called themselves Airiia. European scholars consequently surmised that the  people  who  spoke  the  primordial  language  that  gave  birth  to  both  Sanskrit and  Persian  (as  well  as  to  Greek,  Latin,  Gothic  and  Celtic)  must  have  called themselves  Aryans.  Could  it  be  a  coincidence  that  those  who  founded  the magnificent Indian, Persian, Greek and Roman civilisations were all Aryans? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next,  British,  French  and  German  scholars  wedded  the  linguistic  theory  about the industrious Aryans to Darwin’s theory of natural selection and posited that the Aryans were not just a linguistic group but a biological entity – a race. And not just any race, but a master race of tall, light-haired, blue-eyed, hard-working, and super-rational  humans  who  emerged  from  the  mists  of  the  north  to  lay  the foundations of culture throughout the world. Regrettably, the Aryans who invaded India  and  Persia  intermarried  with  the  local  natives  they  found  in  these  lands, losing their light complexions and blond hair, and with them their rationality and diligence.  The civilisations of India and Persia consequently declined. In Europe, on the other hand, the Aryans preserved their racial purity. This is why Europeans had managed to conquer the world, and why they were  t to rule it – provided they took precautions not to mix with inferior races. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such racist theories, prominent and respectable for many decades, have become</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a>anathema  among  scientists  and  politicians  alike.  People  continue  to  conduct  a heroic  struggle  against  racism  without  noticing  that  the  battlefront  has  shifted, and  that  the  place  of  racism  in  imperial  ideology  has  now  been  replaced  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘culturism’. There is no such word, but it’s about time we coined it. Among today’s elites, assertions about the contrasting merits of diverse human groups are almost always  couched  in  terms  of  historical  di erences  between  cultures  rather  than biological  di erences  between  races.  We  no  longer  say,  ‘It’s  in  their  blood.’  We say, ‘It’s in their culture.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus  European  right-wing  parties  which  oppose  Muslim  immigration  usually take care to avoid racial terminology. Marine le Pen’s speechwriters would have been shown the door on the spot had they suggested that the leader of the Front National go on television to declare that, ‘We don’t want those inferior Semites to dilute our Aryan blood and spoil our Aryan civilisation.’ Instead, the French Front National, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alliance for the Future of Austria and their  like  tend  to  argue  that  Western  culture,  as  it  has  evolved  in  Europe,  is characterised  by  democratic  values,  tolerance  and  gender  equality,  whereas Muslim culture, which evolved in the Middle East, is characterised by hierarchical politics,  fanaticism  and  misogyny.  Since  the  two  cultures  are  so  di erent,  and since  many  Muslim  immigrants  are  unwilling  (and  perhaps  unable)  to  adopt Western  values,  they  should  not  be  allowed  to  enter,  lest  they  foment  internal conflicts and corrode European democracy and liberalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  culturist  arguments  are  fed  by  scienti c  studies  in  the  humanities  and social  sciences  that  highlight  the  so-called  clash  of  civilisations  and  the fundamental  di erences  between  di erent  cultures.  Not  all  historians  and anthropologists accept these theories or support their political usages. But whereas biologists today have an easy time disavowing racism, simply explaining that the biological di erences  between  present-day  human  populations  are  trivial,  it  is harder  for  historians  and  anthropologists  to  disavow  culturism.  After  all,  if  the di erences between human cultures are trivial, why should we pay historians and anthropologists to study them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scientists have provided the imperial project with practical knowledge, ideological justi cation  and  technological  gadgets.  Without  this  contribution  it  is  highly questionable whether Europeans could have conquered the world. The conquerors returned  the  favour  by  providing  scientists  with  information  and  protection, supporting  all  kinds  of  strange  and  fascinating  projects  and  spreading  the scienti c  way  of  thinking  to  the  far  corners  of  the  earth.  Without  imperial support,  it  is  doubtful  whether  modern  science  would  have  progressed  very  far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are very few scienti c disciplines that did not begin their lives as servants to imperial growth and that do not owe a large proportion of their discoveries, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>collections, buildings and scholarships to the generous help of army o cers, navy captains and imperial governors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  obviously  not  the  whole  story.  Science  was  supported  by  other institutions,  not  just  by  empires.  And  the  European  empires  rose  and  ourished thanks also to factors other than science. Behind the meteoric rise of both science and  empire  lurks  one  particularly  important  force:  capitalism.  Were  it  not  for businessmen seeking to make money, Columbus would not have reached America, James Cook would not have reached Australia, and Neil Armstrong would never have taken that small step on the surface of the moon. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a><b class="calibre3">16</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Capitalist Creed</p>
<p class="calibre1">MONEY  HAS  BEEN  ESSENTIAL  BOTH  FOR  building  empires  and  for  promoting science. But is money the ultimate goal of these undertakings, or perhaps just a dangerous necessity? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  not  easy  to  grasp  the  true  role  of  economics  in  modern  history.  Whole volumes  have  been  written  about  how  money  founded  states  and  ruined  them, opened  new  horizons  and  enslaved  millions,  moved  the  wheels  of  industry  and drove  hundreds  of  species  into  extinction.  Yet  to  understand  modern  economic history, you really need to understand just a single word. The word is growth. For better or worse, in sickness and in health, the modern economy has been growing like  a  hormone-soused  teenager.  It  eats  up  everything  it  can  nd  and  puts  on inches faster than you can count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  most  of  history  the  economy  stayed  much  the  same  size.  Yes,  global production increased, but this was due mostly to demographic expansion and the settlement  of  new  lands.  Per  capita  production  remained  static.  But  all  that changed in the modern age. In 1500, global production of goods and services was equal to about $250 billion; today it hovers around $60 trillion. More importantly, in  1500,  annual  per  capita  production  averaged  $550,  while  today  every  man, woman and child produces, on the average, $8,800 a year. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">1</a> What accounts for this stupendous growth? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Economics  is  a  notoriously  complicated  subject.  To  make  things  easier,  let’s imagine a simple example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Samuel Greedy, a shrewd financier, founds a bank in El Dorado, California. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A. A. Stone, an up-and-coming contractor in El Dorado,  nishes his  rst big job, receiving payment in cash to the tune of $1 million. He deposits this sum in Mr Greedy’s bank. The bank now has $1 million in capital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the meantime, Jane McDoughnut, an experienced but impecunious El Dorado</p>
<p class="calibre1">chef, thinks she sees a business opportunity – there’s no really good bakery in her part  of  town.  But  she  doesn’t  have  enough  money  of  her  own  to  buy  a  proper facility  complete  with  industrial  ovens,  sinks,  knives  and  pots.  She  goes  to  the bank,  presents  her  business  plan  to  Greedy,  and  persuades  him  that  it’s  a worthwhile investment. He issues her a $1 million loan, by crediting her account</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>in the bank with that sum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">McDoughnut now hires Stone, the contractor, to build and furnish her bakery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His price is $1,000,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she pays him, with a cheque drawn on her account, Stone deposits it in his account in the Greedy bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So how much money does Stone have in his bank account? Right, $2 million. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How much money, cash, is actually located in the bank’s safe? Yes, $1 million. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  doesn’t  stop  there.  As  contractors  are  wont  to  do,  two  months  into  the  job Stone  informs  McDoughnut  that,  due  to  unforeseen  problems  and  expenses,  the bill for constructing the bakery will actually be $2 million. Mrs McDoughnut is not pleased, but she can hardly stop the job in the middle. So she pays another visit to the  bank,  convinces  Mr  Greedy  to  give  her  an  additional  loan,  and  he  puts another  $1  million  in  her  account.  She  transfers  the  money  to  the  contractor’s account. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How much money does Stone have in his account now? He’s got $3 million. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how much money is actually sitting in the bank? Still just $1 million. In fact, the same $1 million that’s been in the bank all along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Current  US  banking  law  permits  the  bank  to  repeat  this  exercise  seven  more times.  The  contractor  would  eventually  have  $10  million  in  his  account,  even though the bank still has but $1 million in its vaults. Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">2 </a>If all of the account  holders  at  Barclays  Bank  suddenly  demand  their  money,  Barclays  will promptly collapse (unless the government steps in to save it). The same is true of Lloyds, Deutsche Bank, Citibank, and all other banks in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It sounds like a giant Ponzi scheme, doesn’t it? But if it’s a fraud, then the entire modern economy is a fraud. The fact is, it’s not a deception, but rather a tribute to the  amazing  abilities  of  the  human  imagination.  What  enables  banks  –  and  the entire economy – to survive and  ourish is our trust in the future. This trust is the sole backing for most of the money in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  bakery  example,  the  discrepancy  between  the  contractor’s  account statement  and  the  amount  of  money  actually  in  the  bank  is  Mrs  McDoughnut’s bakery. Mr Greedy has put the bank’s money into the asset, trusting that one day it  would  be  pro table.  The  bakery  hasn’t  baked  a  loaf  of  bread  yet,  but McDoughnut and Greedy anticipate that a year hence it will be selling thousands of  loaves,  rolls,  cakes  and  cookies  each  day,  at  a  handsome  pro t.  Mrs McDoughnut will then be able to repay her loan, with interest. If at that point Mr Stone decides to withdraw his savings, Greedy will be able to come up with the cash. The entire enterprise is thus founded on trust in an imaginary future – the trust  that  the  entrepreneur  and  the  banker  have  in  the  bakery  of  their  dreams, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>along with the contractor’s trust in the future solvency of the bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve already seen that money is an astounding thing because it can represent myriad  di erent  objects  and  convert  anything  into  almost  anything  else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  before  the  modern  era  this  ability  was  limited.  In  most  cases,  money could represent and convert only things that actually existed in the present. This imposed a severe limitation on growth, since it made it very hard to  nance new enterprises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider  our  bakery  again.  Could  McDoughnut  get  it  built  if  money  could represent only tangible objects? No. In the present, she has a lot of dreams, but no tangible resources. The only way she could get her bakery built would be to  nd a contractor willing to work today and receive payment in a few years’ time, if and when the bakery starts making money. Alas, such contractors are rare breeds. So our  entrepreneur  is  in  a  bind.  Without  a  bakery,  she  can’t  bake cakes.  Without cakes, she can’t make money. Without money, she can’t hire a contractor. Without a contractor, she has no bakery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humankind was trapped in this predicament for thousands of years. As a result, economies remained frozen. The way out of the trap was discovered only in the modern era, with the appearance of a new system based on trust in the future. In it,  people  agreed  to  represent  imaginary  goods  –  goods  that  do  not  exist  in  the present – with a special kind of money they called ‘credit’. Credit enables us to build the present at the expense of the future. It’s founded on the assumption that our future resources are sure to be far more abundant than our present resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A host of new and wonderful opportunities open up if we can build things in the present using future income. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If credit is such a wonderful thing, why did nobody think of it earlier? Of course they did. Credit arrangements of one kind or another have existed in all known human  cultures,  going  back  at  least  to  ancient  Sumer.  The  problem  in  previous eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how to use it. It was that people seldom  wanted  to  extend  much  credit  because  they  didn’t  trust  that  the  future would  be  better  than  the  present.  They  generally  believed  that  times  past  had been better than their own times and that the future would be worse, or at best much the same. To put that in economic terms, they believed that the total amount of wealth was limited, if not dwindling. People therefore considered it a bad bet to assume  that  they  personally,  or  their  kingdom,  or  the  entire  world,  would  be producing more wealth ten years down the line. Business looked like a zero-sum game. Of course, the pro ts of one particular bakery might rise, but only at the expense of the bakery next door. Venice might  ourish, but only by impoverishing Genoa. The king of England might enrich himself, but only by robbing the king of France. You could cut the pie in many different ways, but it never got any bigger. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That’s why many cultures concluded that making bundles of money was sinful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Jesus said, ‘It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God’ (Matthew 19:24). If the pie is static, and I have a big part of it, then I must have taken somebody else’s slice. The rich were  obliged  to  do  penance  for  their  evil  deeds  by  giving  some  of  their  surplus wealth to charity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Entrepreneur’s Dilemma</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If the global pie stayed the same size, there was no margin for credit. Credit is the di erence between today’s pie and tomorrows pie. If the pie stays the same, why extend credit? It would be an unacceptable risk unless you believed that the baker  or  king  asking  for  your  money  might  be  able  to  steal  a  slice  from  a competitor. So it was hard to get a loan in the premodern world, and when you got  one  it  was  usually  <i class="calibre4">smal </i>,  <i class="calibre4">short-term</i>,  <i class="calibre4">and  subject  to  high  interest  rates</i>.  Upstart entrepreneurs  thus  found  it  di cult  to  open  new  bakeries  and  great  kings  who wanted  to  build  palaces  or  wage  wars  had  no  choice  but  to  raise  the  necessary funds through high taxes and tariffs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a><b class="calibre3">The Magic Circle of the Modern Economy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That was  ne for kings (as long as their subjects remained docile), but a scullery maid  who  had  a  great  idea  for  a  bakery  and  wanted  to  move  up  in  the  world generally  could  only  dream  of  wealth  while  scrubbing  down  the  royal  kitchens floors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was lose-lose. Because credit was limited, people had trouble  nancing new businesses.  Because  there  were  few  new  businesses,  the  economy  did  not  grow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  it  did  not  grow,  people  assumed  it  never  would,  and  those  who  had capital  were  wary  of  extending  credit.  The  expectation  of  stagnation  ful lled itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A Growing Pie</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then came the Scienti c Revolution and the idea of progress. The idea of progress is  built  on  the  notion  that  if  we  admit  our  ignorance  and  invest  resources  in research, things can improve. This idea was soon translated into economic terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whoever believes in progress believes that geographical discoveries, technological inventions and organisational developments can increase the sum total of human production,  trade  and  wealth.  New  trade  routes  in  the  Atlantic  could  ourish without  ruining  old  routes  in  the  Indian  Ocean.  New  goods  could  be  produced without reducing the production of old ones. For instance, one could open a new bakery  specialising  in  chocolate  cakes  and  croissants  without  causing  bakeries specialising in bread to go bust. Everybody would simply develop new tastes and eat more. I can be wealthy without your becoming poor; I can be obese without your dying of hunger. The entire global pie can grow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the last 500 years the idea of progress convinced people to put more and more  trust  in  the  future.  This  trust  created  credit;  credit  brought  real  economic growth; and growth strengthened the trust in the future and opened the way for even more credit. It didn’t happen overnight – the economy behaved more like a roller coaster than a balloon. But over the long run, with the bumps evened out, the  general  direction  was  unmistakable.  Today,  there  is  so  much  credit  in  the world  that  governments,  business  corporations  and  private  individuals  easily obtain  <i class="calibre4">large</i>,  <i class="calibre4">long-term and low-interest loans</i> that far exceed current income. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a><img src="index-266_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Economic History of the World in a Nutshell</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The belief in the growing global pie eventually turned revolutionary. In 1776</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Scottish economist Adam Smith published  <i class="calibre4">The Wealth of Nations</i>, probably the most important economics manifesto of all time. In the eighth chapter of its  rst volume, Smith made the following novel argument: when a landlord, a weaver, or a shoemaker has greater pro ts than he needs to maintain his own family, he uses the surplus to employ more assistants, in order to further increase his pro ts. The more pro ts he has, the more assistants he can employ. It follows that an increase in  the  pro ts  of  private  entrepreneurs  is  the  basis  for  the  increase  in  collective wealth and prosperity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  may  not  strike  you  as  very  original,  because  we  all  live  in  a  capitalist world that takes Smith’s argument for granted. We hear variations on this theme every day in the news. Yet Smith’s claim that the sel sh human urge to increase private pro ts is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history – revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so from a moral and political perspective. What Smith says is, in fact, that  greed  is  good,  and  that  by  becoming  richer  I  bene t  everybody,  not  just myself.  <i class="calibre4">Egoism is altruism</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith  taught  people  to  think  about  the  economy  as  a  ‘win-win  situation’,  in which my pro ts are also your pro ts. Not only can we both enjoy a bigger slice of pie at the same time, but the increase in your slice depends upon the increase in my slice. If I am poor, you too will be poor since I cannot buy your products or services.  If  I  am  rich,  you  too  will  be  enriched  since  you  can  now  sell  me something.  Smith  denied  the  traditional  contradiction  between  wealth  and morality, and threw open the gates of heaven for the rich. Being rich meant being moral. In Smiths story, people become rich not by despoiling their neighbours, but by  increasing  the  overall  size  of  the  pie.  And  when  the  pie  grows,  everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>bene ts.  The  rich  are  accordingly  the  most  useful  and  benevolent  people  in society, because they turn the wheels of growth for everyone’s advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All this depends, however, on the rich using their pro ts to open new factories and hire new employees, rather than wasting them on non-productive activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith therefore repeated like a mantra the maxim that ‘When pro ts increase, the landlord or weaver will employ more assistants’ and not ‘When pro ts increase, Scrooge will hoard his money in a chest and take it out only to count his coins.’ A crucial part of the modern capitalist economy was the emergence of a new ethic, according to which pro ts ought to be reinvested in production. This brings about more pro ts, which are again reinvested in production, which brings more pro ts, et  cetera  ad  in nitum.  Investments  can  be  made  in  many  ways:  enlarging  the factory,  conducting  scienti c  research,  developing  new  products.  Yet  all  these investments must somehow increase production and translate into larger pro ts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the new capitalist creed, the first and most sacred commandment is: ‘The profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s  why  capitalism  is  called  ‘capitalism’.  Capitalism  distinguishes  ‘capital’</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  mere  ‘wealth’.  Capital  consists  of  money,  goods  and  resources  that  are invested  in  production.  Wealth,  on  the  other  hand,  is  buried  in  the  ground  or wasted  on  unproductive  activities.  A  pharaoh  who  pours  resources  into  a  non-productive pyramid is not a capitalist. A pirate who loots a Spanish treasure  eet and buries a chest full of glittering coins on the beach of some Caribbean island is not a capitalist. But a hard-working factory hand who reinvests part of his income in the stock market is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  idea  that  ‘The  pro ts  of  production  must  be  reinvested  in  increasing production’ sounds trivial. Yet it was alien to most people throughout history. In premodern times, people believed that production was more or less constant. So why reinvest your pro ts if production won’t increase by much, no matter what you do? Thus medieval noblemen espoused an ethic of generosity and conspicuous consumption.  They  spent  their  revenues  on  tournaments,  banquets,  palaces  and wars, and on charity and monumental cathedrals. Few tried to reinvest pro ts in increasing their manors’ output, developing better kinds of wheat, or looking for new markets. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a><img src="index-268_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  modern  era,  the  nobility  has  been  overtaken  by  a  new  elite  whose members are true believers in the capitalist creed. The new capitalist elite is made up  not  of  dukes  and  marquises,  but  of  board  chairmen,  stock  traders  and industrialists. These magnates are far richer than the medieval nobility, but they are far less interested in extravagant consumption, and they spend a much smaller part of their profits on non-productive activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Medieval noblemen wore colourful robes of gold and silk, and devoted much of their  time  to  attending  banquets,  carnivals  and  glamorous  tournaments.  In comparison, modern CEOs don dreary uniforms called suits that a ord them all the  panache  of  a  ock  of  crows,  and  they  have  little  time  for  festivities.  The typical venture capitalist rushes from one business meeting to another, trying to gure  out  where  to  invest  his  capital  and  following  the  ups  and  downs  of  the stocks and bonds he owns. True, his suits might be Versace and he might get to travel in a private jet, but these expenses are nothing compared to what he invests in increasing human production. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s  not  just  Versace-clad  business  moguls  who  invest  to  increase  productivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ordinary  folk  and  government  agencies  think  along  similar  lines.  How  many dinner  conversations  in  modest  neighbourhoods  sooner  or  later  bog  down  in interminable debate about whether it is better to invest one’s savings in the stock market, bonds or property? Governments too strive to invest their tax revenues in productive enterprises that will increase future income – for example, building a new port could make it easier for factories to export their products, enabling them to  make  more  taxable  income,  thereby  increasing  the  government’s  future revenues. Another government might prefer to invest in education, on the grounds that educated people form the basis for the lucrative high-tech industries, which pay lots of taxes without needing extensive port facilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Capitalism  began  as  a  theory  about  how  the  economy  functions.  It  was  both</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a>descriptive  and  prescriptive  –  it  o ered  an  account  of  how  money  worked  and promoted  the  idea  that  reinvesting  pro ts  in  production  leads  to  fast  economic growth. But capitalism gradually became far more than just an economic doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It now encompasses an ethic – a set of teachings about how people should behave, educate their children and even think. Its principal tenet is that economic growth is  the  supreme  good,  or  at  least  a  proxy  for  the  supreme  good,  because  justice, freedom and even happiness all depend on economic growth. Ask a capitalist how to  bring  justice  and  political  freedom  to  a  place  like  Zimbabwe  or  Afghanistan, and  you  are  likely  to  get  a  lecture  on  how  economic  a uence  and  a  thriving middle  class  are  essential  for  stable  democratic  institutions,  and  about  the  need therefore to inculcate Afghan tribesmen in the values of free enterprise, thrift and self-reliance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This new religion has had a decisive in uence on the development of modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">science, too. Scienti c research is usually funded by either governments or private businesses.  When  capitalist  governments  and  businesses  consider  investing  in  a particular scienti c project, the  rst questions are usually, ‘Will this project enable us to increase production and pro ts? Will it produce economic growth?’ A project that can’t clear these hurdles has little chance of  nding a sponsor. No history of modern science can leave capitalism out of the picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversely, the history of capitalism is unintelligible without taking science into account.  Capitalisms  belief  in  perpetual  economic  growth  ies  in  the  face  of almost  everything  we  know  about  the  universe.  A  society  of  wolves  would  be extremely  foolish  to  believe  that  the  supply  of  sheep  would  keep  on  growing inde nitely.  The  human  economy  has  nevertheless  managed  to  grow</p>
<p class="calibre1">exponentially  throughout  the  modern  era,  thanks  only  to  the  fact  that  scientists come up with another discovery or gadget every few years – such as the continent of  America,  the  internal  combustion  engine,  or  genetically  engineered  sheep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Banks and governments print money, but ultimately, it is the scientists who foot the bill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the last few years, banks and governments have been frenziedly printing money.  Everybody  is  terri ed  that  the  current  economic  crisis  may  stop  the growth of the economy. So they are creating trillions of dollars, euros and yen out of thin air, pumping cheap credit into the system, and hoping that the scientists, technicians  and  engineers  will  manage  to  come  up  with  something  really  big, before  the  bubble  bursts.  Everything  depends  on  the  people  in  the  labs.  New discoveries in  elds such as biotechnology and nanotechnology could create entire new industries, whose pro ts could back the trillions of make-believe money that the banks and governments have created since 2008. If the labs do not ful l these expectations before the bubble bursts, we are heading towards very rough times. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>Columbus Searches for an Investor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Capitalism played a decisive role not only in the rise of modern science, but also in the emergence of European imperialism. And it was European imperialism that created  the  capitalist  credit  system  in  the  rst  place.  Of  course,  credit  was  not invented in modern Europe. It existed in almost all agricultural societies, and in the early modern period the emergence of European capitalism was closely linked to economic developments in Asia. Remember, too, that until the late eighteenth century, Asia was the world’s economic powerhouse, meaning that Europeans had far less capital at their disposal than the Chinese, Muslims or Indians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  in  the  sociopolitical  systems  of  China,  India  and  the  Muslim  world, credit  played  only  a  secondary  role.  Merchants  and  bankers  in  the  markets  of Istanbul, Isfahan, Delhi and Beijing may have thought along capitalist lines, but the kings and generals in the palaces and forts tended to despise merchants and mercantile  thinking.  Most  non-European  empires  of  the  early  modern  era  were established  by  great  conquerors  such  as  Nurhaci  and  Nader  Shah,  or  by bureaucratic and military elites as in the Qing and Ottoman empires. Financing wars  through  taxes  and  plunder  (without  making  ne  distinctions  between  the two),  they  owed  little  to  credit  systems,  and  they  cared  even  less  about  the interests of bankers and investors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Europe,  on  the  other  hand,  kings  and  generals  gradually  adopted  the mercantile way of thinking, until merchants and bankers became the ruling elite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  European  conquest  of  the  world  was  increasingly  nanced  through  credit rather  than  taxes,  and  was  increasingly  directed  by  capitalists  whose  main ambition was to receive maximum returns on their investments. The empires built by bankers and merchants in frock coats and top hats defeated the empires built by  kings  and  noblemen  in  gold  clothes  and  shining  armour.  The  mercantile empires were simply much shrewder in  nancing their conquests. Nobody wants to pay taxes, but everyone is happy to invest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1484  Christopher  Columbus  approached  the  king  of  Portugal  with  the proposal  that  he  nance  a  eet  that  would  sail  westward  to  nd  a  new  trade route to East Asia. Such explorations were a very risky and costly business. A lot of money was needed in order to build ships, buy supplies, and pay sailors and soldiers – and there was no guarantee that the investment would yield a return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The king of Portugal declined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a present-day start-up entrepreneur, Columbus did not give up. He pitched his  idea  to  other  potential  investors  in  Italy,  France,  England,  and  again  in Portugal.  Each  time  he  was  rejected.  He  then  tried  his  luck  with  Ferdinand  and Isabella, rulers of newly united Spain. He took on some experienced lobbyists, and with their help he managed to convince Queen Isabella to invest. As every school-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>child knows, Isabella hit the jackpot. Columbus’ discoveries enabled the Spaniards to conquer America, where they established gold and silver mines as well as sugar and tobacco plantations that enriched the Spanish kings, bankers and merchants beyond their wildest dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  hundred  years  later,  princes  and  bankers  were  willing  to  extend  far  more credit to Columbus’ successors, and they had more capital at their disposal, thanks to the treasures reaped from America. Equally important, princes and bankers had far more trust in the potential of exploration, and were more willing to part with their money. This was the magic circle of imperial capitalism: credit  nanced new discoveries;  discoveries  led  to  colonies;  colonies  provided  pro ts;  pro ts  built trust; and trust translated into more credit. Nurhaci and Nader Shah ran out of fuel after  a  few  thousand  kilometres.  Capitalist  entrepreneurs  only  increased  their financial momentum from conquest to conquest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  these  expeditions  remained  chancy  a airs,  so  credit  markets  nevertheless remained  quite  cautious.  Many  expeditions  returned  to  Europe  empty-handed, having  discovered  nothing  of  value.  The  English,  for  instance,  wasted  a  lot  of capital in fruitless attempts to discover a north-western passage to Asia through the  Arctic.  Many  other  expeditions  didn’t  return  at  all.  Ships  hit  icebergs, foundered  in  tropical  storms,  or  fell  victim  to  pirates.  In  order  to  increase  the number of potential investors and reduce the risk they incurred, Europeans turned to limited liability joint-stock companies. Instead of a single investor betting all his money on a single rickety ship, the joint-stock company collected money from a large number of investors, each risking only a small portion of his capital. The risks were thereby curtailed, but no cap was placed on the pro ts. Even a small investment in the right ship could turn you into a millionaire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Decade by decade, western Europe witnessed the development of a sophisticated nancial system that could raise large amounts of credit on short notice and put it at  the  disposal  of  private  entrepreneurs  and  governments.  This  system  could nance  explorations  and  conquests  far  more  e ciently  than  any  kingdom  or empire. The new-found power of credit can be seen in the bitter struggle between Spain and the Netherlands. In the sixteenth century, Spain was the most powerful state in Europe, holding sway over a vast global empire. It ruled much of Europe, huge chunks of North and South America, the Philippine Islands, and a string of bases along the coasts of Africa and Asia. Every year,  eets heavy with American and  Asian  treasures  returned  to  the  ports  of  Seville  and  Cadiz.  The  Netherlands was a small and windy swamp, devoid of natural resources, a small corner of the king of Spain’s dominions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1568 the Dutch, who were mainly Protestant, revolted against their Catholic Spanish  overlord.  At  rst  the  rebels  seemed  to  play  the  role  of  Don  Quixote, courageously tilting at invincible windmills. Yet within eighty years the Dutch had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a>not only secured their independence from Spain, but had managed to replace the Spaniards and their Portuguese allies as masters of the ocean highways, build a global Dutch empire, and become the richest state in Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The secret of Dutch success was credit. The Dutch burghers, who had little taste for  combat  on  land,  hired  mercenary  armies  to  ght  the  Spanish  for  them.  The Dutch  themselves  meanwhile  took  to  the  sea  in  ever-larger  eets.  Mercenary armies and cannon-brandishing  eets cost a fortune, but the Dutch were able to nance  their  military  expeditions  more  easily  than  the  mighty  Spanish  Empire because they secured the trust of the burgeoning European  nancial system at a time  when  the  Spanish  king  was  carelessly  eroding  its  trust  in  him.  Financiers extended  the  Dutch  enough  credit  to  set  up  armies  and  eets,  and  these  armies and  eets  gave  the  Dutch  control  of  world  trade  routes,  which  in  turn  yielded handsome  pro ts.  The  pro ts  allowed  the  Dutch  to  repay  the  loans,  which strengthened the trust of the  nanciers. Amsterdam was fast becoming not only one  of  the  most  important  ports  of  Europe,  but  also  the  continent’s  nancial Mecca. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How exactly did the Dutch win the trust of the  nancial system? Firstly, they were sticklers about repaying their loans on time and in full, making the extension of credit  less  risky  for  lenders.  Secondly,  their  country’s  judicial  system  enjoyed independence and protected private rights – in particular private property rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Capital trickles away from dictatorial states that fail to defend private individuals and  their  property.  Instead,  it  ows  into  states  upholding  the  rule  of  law  and private property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine that you are the son of a solid family of German  nanciers. Your father sees  an  opportunity  to  expand  the  business  by  opening  branches  in  major European cities. He sends you to Amsterdam and your younger brother to Madrid, giving you each 10,000 gold coins to invest. Your brother lends his start-up capital at interest to the king of Spain, who needs it to raise an army to  ght the king of France.  You  decide  to  lend  yours  to  a  Dutch  merchant,  who  wants  to  invest  in scrubland on the southern end of a desolate island called Manhattan, certain that property values there will skyrocket as the Hudson River turns into a major trade artery. Both loans are to be repaid within a year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The year passes. The Dutch merchant sells the land he’s bought at a handsome markup  and  repays  your  money  with  the  interest  he  promised.  Your  father  is pleased. But your little brother in Madrid is getting nervous. The war with France ended well for the king of Spain, but he has now embroiled himself in a con ict with the Turks. He needs every penny to  nance the new war, and thinks this is far  more  important  than  repaying  old  debts.  Your  brother  sends  letters  to  the palace and asks friends with connections at court to intercede, but to no avail. Not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>only has your brother not earned the promised interest – he’s lost the principal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your father is not pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, to make matters worse, the king sends a treasury o cial to your brother to tell him, in no uncertain terms, that he expects to receive another loan of the same size, forthwith. Your brother has no money to lend. He writes home to Dad, trying  to  persuade  him  that  this  time  the  king  will  come  through.  The paterfamilias  has  a  soft  spot  for  his  youngest,  and  agrees  with  a  heavy  heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another 10,000 gold coins disappear into the Spanish treasury, never to be seen again. Meanwhile in Amsterdam, things are looking bright. You make more and more  loans  to  enterprising  Dutch  merchants,  who  repay  them  promptly  and  in full. But your luck does not hold indefinitely. One of your usual clients has a hunch that wooden clogs are going to be the next fashion craze in Paris, and asks you for a  loan  to  set  up  a  footwear  emporium  in  the  French  capital.  You  lend  him  the money, but unfortunately the clogs don’t catch on with the French ladies, and the disgruntled merchant refuses to repay the loan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your father is furious, and tells both of you it is time to unleash the lawyers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your brother  les suit in Madrid against the Spanish monarch, while you  le suit in Amsterdam against the erstwhile wooden-shoe wizard. In Spain, the law courts are subservient to the king – the judges serve at his pleasure and fear punishment if they do not do his will. In the Netherlands, the courts are a separate branch of government, not dependent on the country’s burghers and princes. The court in Madrid throws out your brother’s suit, while the court in Amsterdam  nds in your favour and puts a lien on the clog-merchant’s assets to force him to pay up. Your father  has  learned  his  lesson.  Better  to  do  business  with  merchants  than  with kings, and better to do it in Holland than in Madrid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And your brother’s travails are not over. The king of Spain desperately needs more money to pay his army. He’s sure that your father has cash to spare. So he brings  trumped-up  treason  charges  against  your  brother.  If  he  doesn’t  come  up with 20,000 gold coins forthwith, he’ll get cast into a dungeon and rot there until he dies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your father has had enough. He pays the ransom for his beloved son, but swears never  to  do  business  in  Spain  again.  He  closes  his  Madrid  branch  and  relocates your brother to Rotterdam. Two branches in Holland now look like a really good idea.  He  hears  that  even  Spanish  capitalists  are  smuggling  their  fortunes  out  of their country. They, too, realise that if they want to keep their money and use it to gain more wealth, they are better o  investing it where the rule of law prevails and where private property is respected – in the Netherlands, for example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In such ways did the king of Spain squander the trust of investors at the same time  that  Dutch  merchants  gained  their  con dence.  And  it  was  the  Dutch merchants – not the Dutch state – who built the Dutch Empire. The king of Spain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>kept on trying to  nance and maintain his conquests by raising unpopular taxes from a disgruntled populace. The Dutch merchants  nanced conquest by getting loans, and increasingly also by selling shares in their companies that entitled their holders  to  receive  a  portion  of  the  company’s  pro ts.  Cautious  investors  who would never have given their money to the king of Spain, and who would have thought twice before extending credit to the Dutch government, happily invested fortunes  in  the  Dutch  joint-stock  companies  that  were  the  mainstay  of  the  new empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you thought a company was going to make a big pro t but it had already sold all its shares, you could buy some from people who owned them, probably for a higher price than they originally paid. If you bought shares and later discovered that  the  company  was  in  dire  straits,  you  could  try  to  unload  your  stock  for  a lower  price.  The  resulting  trade  in  company  shares  led  to  the  establishment  in most  major  European  cities  of  stock  exchanges,  places  where  the  shares  of companies were traded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  most  famous  Dutch  joint-stock  company,  the  Vereenigde  Oostindische Compagnie,  or  VOC  for  short,  was  chartered  in  1602,  just  as  the  Dutch  were throwing o  Spanish rule and the boom of Spanish artillery could still be heard not  far  from  Amsterdam’s  ramparts.  VOC  used  the  money  it  raised  from  selling shares  to  build  ships,  send  them  to  Asia,  and  bring  back  Chinese,  Indian  and Indonesian  goods.  It  also  nanced  military  actions  taken  by  company  ships against competitors and pirates. Eventually VOC money  nanced the conquest of Indonesia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indonesia  is  the  world’s  biggest  archipelago.  Its  thousands  upon  thousands  of islands  were  ruled  in  the  early  seventeenth  century  by  hundreds  of  kingdoms, principalities,  sultanates  and  tribes.  When  VOC  merchants  rst  arrived  in Indonesia  in  1603,  their  aims  were  strictly  commercial.  However,  in  order  to secure  their  commercial  interests  and  maximise  the  pro ts  of  the  shareholders, VOC  merchants  began  to  ght  against  local  potentates  who  charged  in ated tari s,  as  well  as  against  European  competitors.  VOC  armed  its  merchant  ships with  cannons;  it  recruited  European,  Japanese,  Indian  and  Indonesian mercenaries;  and  it  built  forts  and  conducted  full-scale  battles  and  sieges.  This enterprise  may  sound  a  little  strange  to  us,  but  in  the  early  modern  age  it  was common  for  private  companies  to  hire  not  only  soldiers,  but  also  generals  and admirals,  cannons  and  ships,  and  even  entire  o -the-shelf  armies.  The international community took this for granted and didn’t raise an eyebrow when a private company established an empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Island  after  island  fell  to  VOC  mercenaries  and  a  large  part  of  Indonesia became a VOC colony. VOC ruled Indonesia for close to 200 years. Only in 1800</p>
<p class="calibre1">did  the  Dutch  state  assume  control  of  Indonesia,  making  it  a  Dutch  national</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a>colony  for  the  following  150  years.  Today  some  people  warn  that  twenty- rst-century  corporations  are  accumulating  too  much  power.  Early  modern  history shows  just  how  far  that  can  go  if  businesses  are  allowed  to  pursue  their  self-interest unchecked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While VOC operated in the Indian Ocean, the Dutch West Indies Company, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">WIC, plied the Atlantic. In order to control trade on the important Hudson River, WIC built a settlement called New Amsterdam on an island at the river’s mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colony was threatened by Indians and repeatedly attacked by the British, who eventually  captured  it  in  1664.  The  British  changed  its  name  to  New  York.  The remains of the wall built by WIC to defend its colony against Indians and British are today paved over by the world’s most famous street – Wall Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the seventeenth century wound to an end, complacency and costly continental wars caused the Dutch to lose not only New York, but also their place as Europe’s nancial  and  imperial  engine.  The  vacancy  was  hotly  contested  by  France  and Britain. At  rst France seemed to be in a far stronger position. It was bigger than Britain,  richer,  more  populous,  and  it  possessed  a  larger  and  more  experienced army. Yet Britain managed to win the trust of the financial system whereas France proved  itself  unworthy.  The  behaviour  of  the  French  crown  was  particularly notorious  during  what  was  called  the  Mississippi  Bubble,  the  largest  nancial crisis of eighteenth-century Europe. That story also begins with an empire-building joint-stock company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1717 the Mississippi Company, chartered in France, set out to colonise the lower Mississippi valley, establishing the city of New Orleans in the process. To finance its ambitious plans, the company, which had good connections at the court of  King  Louis  XV,  sold  shares  on  the  Paris  stock  exchange.  John  Law,  the company’s  director,  was  also  the  governor  of  the  central  bank  of  France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, the king had appointed him controller-general of  nances, an o ce roughly  equivalent  to  that  of  a  modern  nance  minister.  In  1717  the  lower Mississippi valley o ered few attractions besides swamps and alligators, yet the Mississippi Company spread tales of fabulous riches and boundless opportunities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">French aristocrats, businessmen and the stolid members of the urban bourgeoisie fell for these fantasies, and Mississippi share prices skyrocketed. Initially, shares were o ered at 500 livres apiece. On 1 August 1719, shares traded at 2,750 livres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  30  August,  they  were  worth  4,100  livres,  and  on  4  September,  they  reached 5,000 livres. On 2 December the price of a Mississippi share crossed the threshold of  10,000  livres.  Euphoria  swept  the  streets  of  Paris.  People  sold  all  their possessions  and  took  huge  loans  in  order  to  buy  Mississippi  shares.  Everybody believed they’d discovered the easy way to riches. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a><img src="index-276_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p368"><b class="calibre3">39. </b></a><b class="calibre3">New Amsterdam in 1660, at the tip of Manhattan Island. The settlement’s protective wall is today</b> <b class="calibre3">paved over by Wall Street</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  days  later,  the  panic  began.  Some  speculators  realised  that  the  share prices were totally unrealistic and unsustainable. They figured that they had better sell while stock prices were at their peak. As the supply of shares available rose, their  price  declined.  When  other  investors  saw  the  price  going  down,  they  also wanted  to  get  out  quick.  The  stock  price  plummeted  further,  setting  o   an avalanche.  In  order  to  stabilise  prices,  the  central  bank  of  France  –  at  the direction of its governor, John Law – bought up Mississippi shares, but it could not do  so  for  ever.  Eventually  it  ran  out  of  money.  When  this  happened,  the controller-general of finances, the same John Law, authorised the printing of more money in order to buy additional shares. This placed the entire French  nancial system inside the bubble. And not even this  nancial wizardry could save the day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  price  of  Mississippi  shares  dropped  from  10,000  livres  back  to  1,000  livres, and  then  collapsed  completely,  and  the  shares  lost  every  sou  of  their  worth.  By now, the central bank and the royal treasury owned a huge amount of worthless stock and had no money. The big speculators emerged largely unscathed – they had sold in time. Small investors lost everything, and many committed suicide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Mississippi Bubble was one of history’s most spectacular  nancial crashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The royal French  nancial system never recuperated fully from the blow. The way in  which  the  Mississippi  Company  used  its  political  clout  to  manipulate  share prices  and  fuel  the  buying  frenzy  caused  the  public  to  lose  faith  in  the  French</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a>banking system and in the  nancial wisdom of the French king. Louis XV found it more and more di cult to raise credit. This became one of the chief reasons that the overseas French Empire fell into British hands. While the British could borrow money easily and at low interest rates, France had di culties securing loans, and had to pay high interest on them. In order to  nance his growing debts, the king of  France  borrowed  more  and  more  money  at  higher  and  higher  interest  rates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  in  the  1780s,  Louis  XVI,  who  had  ascended  to  the  throne  on  his grandfather’s death, realised that half his annual budget was tied to servicing the interest on his loans, and that he was heading towards bankruptcy. Reluctantly, in 1789, Louis XVI convened the Estates General, the French parliament that had not met for a century and a half, in order to  nd a solution to the crisis. Thus began the French Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  French  overseas  empire  was  crumbling,  the  British  Empire  was expanding  rapidly.  Like  the  Dutch  Empire  before  it, the  British  Empire  was established and run largely by private joint-stock companies based in the London stock exchange. The  rst English settlements in North America were established in the  early  seventeenth  century  by  joint-stock  companies  such  as  the  London Company,  the  Plymouth  Company,  the  Dorchester  Company  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Massachusetts Company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Indian subcontinent too was conquered not by the British state, but by the mercenary army of the British East India Company. This company outperformed even  the  VOC.  From  its  headquarters  in  Leadenhall  Street,  London,  it  ruled  a mighty Indian empire for about a century, maintaining a huge military force of up to  350,000  soldiers,  considerably  outnumbering  the  armed  forces  of  the  British monarchy.  Only  in  1858  did  the  British  crown  nationalise  India  along  with  the company’s private army. Napoleon made fun of the British, calling them a nation of  shopkeepers.  Yet  these  shopkeepers  defeated  Napoleon  himself,  and  their empire was the largest the world has ever seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Name of Capital</p>
<p class="calibre1">The nationalisation of Indonesia by the Dutch crown (1800) and of India by the British crown (1858) hardly ended the embrace of capitalism and empire. On the contrary, the connection only grew stronger during the nineteenth century. Joint-stock companies no longer needed to establish and govern private colonies – their managers  and  large  shareholders  now  pulled  the  strings  of  power  in  London, Amsterdam  and  Paris,  and  they  could  count  on  the  state  to  look  after  their interests.  As  Marx  and  other  social  critics  quipped,  Western  governments  were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a>becoming a capitalist trade union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most notorious example of how governments did the bidding of big money</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  the  First  Opium  War,  fought  between  Britain  and  China  (1840–42).  In  the rst  half  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the  British  East  India  Company  and  sundry British business people made fortunes by exporting drugs, particularly opium, to China.  Millions  of  Chinese  became  addicts,  debilitating  the  country  both economically and socially. In the late 1830s the Chinese government issued a ban on  drug  tra cking,  but  British  drug  merchants  simply  ignored  the  law.  Chinese authorities began to con scate and destroy drug cargos. The drug cartels had close connections  in  Westminster  and  Downing  Street  –  many  MPs  and  Cabinet ministers  in  fact  held  stock  in  the  drug  companies  –  so  they  pressured  the government to take action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1840 Britain duly declared war on China in the name of ‘free trade’. It was a walkover.  The  overcon dent  Chinese  were  no  match  for  Britain’s  new  wonder weapons  –  steamboats,  heavy  artillery,  rockets  and  rapid- re  ri es.  Under  the subsequent  peace  treaty,  China  agreed  not  to  constrain  the  activities  of  British drug  merchants  and  to  compensate  them  for  damages  in icted  by  the  Chinese police.  Furthermore,  the  British  demanded  and  received  control  of  Hong  Kong, which  they  proceeded  to  use  as  a  secure  base  for  drug  tra cking  (Hong  Kong remained  in  British  hands  until  1997).  In  the  late  nineteenth  century,  about  40</p>
<p class="calibre1">million Chinese, a tenth of the country’s population, were opium addicts. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Egypt,  too,  learned  to  respect  the  long  arm  of  British  capitalism.  During  the nineteenth  century,  French  and  British  investors  lent  huge  sums  to  the  rulers  of Egypt,  rst in order to  nance the Suez Canal project, and later to fund far less successful enterprises. Egyptian debt swelled, and European creditors increasingly meddled in Egyptian a airs. In 1881 Egyptian nationalists had had enough and rebelled. They declared a unilateral abrogation of all foreign debt. Queen Victoria was not amused. A year later she dispatched her army and navy to the Nile and Egypt remained a British protectorate until after World War Two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These were hardly the only wars fought in the interests of investors. In fact, war itself  could  become  a  commodity,  just  like  opium.  In  1821  the  Greeks  rebelled against the Ottoman Empire. The uprising aroused great sympathy in liberal and romantic circles in Britain – Lord Byron, the poet, even went to Greece to  ght alongside the insurgents. But London  nanciers saw an opportunity as well. They proposed to the rebel leaders the issue of tradable Greek Rebellion Bonds on the London  stock  exchange.  The  Greeks  would  promise  to  repay  the  bonds,  plus interest, if and when they won their independence. Private investors bought bonds to make a pro t, or out of sympathy for the Greek cause, or both. The value of Greek Rebellion Bonds rose and fell on the London stock exchange in tempo with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a>military successes and failures on the battle elds of Hellas. The Turks gradually gained the upper hand. With a rebel defeat imminent, the bondholders faced the prospect  of  losing  their  trousers.  The  bondholders’  interest  was  the  national interest,  so  the  British  organised  an  international  eet  that,  in  1827,  sank  the main  Ottoman  otilla  in  the  Battle  of  Navarino.  After  centuries  of  subjugation, Greece was  nally free. But freedom came with a huge debt that the new country had no way of repaying. The Greek economy was mortgaged to British creditors for decades to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bear hug between capital and politics has had far-reaching implications for the credit market. The amount of credit in an economy is determined not only by purely economic factors such as the discovery of a new oil  eld or the invention of a  new  machine,  but  also  by  political  events  such  as  regime  changes  or  more ambitious  foreign  policies.  After  the  Battle  of  Navarino,  British  capitalists  were more willing to invest their money in risky overseas deals. They had seen that if a foreign debtor refused to repay loans, Her Majesty’s army would get their money back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why today a country’s credit rating is far more important to its economic well-being  than  are  its  natural  resources.  Credit  ratings  indicate  the  probability that a country will pay its debts. In addition to purely economic data, they take into account political, social and even cultural factors. An oil-rich country cursed with a despotic government, endemic warfare and a corrupt judicial system will usually receive a low credit rating. As a result, it is likely to remain relatively poor since it will not be able to raise the necessary capital to make the most of its oil bounty.  A  country  devoid  of  natural  resources,  but  which  enjoys  peace,  a  fair judicial system and a free government is likely to receive a high credit rating. As such, it may be able to raise enough cheap capital to support a good education system and foster a flourishing high-tech industry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Cult of the Free Market</p>
<p class="calibre1">Capital and politics in uence each other to such an extent that their relations are hotly  debated  by  economists,  politicians  and  the  general  public  alike.  Ardent capitalists  tend  to  argue  that  capital  should  be  free  to  in uence  politics,  but politics  should  not  be  allowed  to  in uence  capital.  They  argue  that  when governments  interfere  in  the  markets,  political  interests  cause  them  to  make unwise investments that result in slower growth. For example, a government may impose  heavy  taxation  on  industrialists  and  use  the  money  to  give  lavish unemployment  bene ts,  which  are  popular  with  voters.  In  the  view  of  many</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a>business  people,  it  would  be  far  better  if  the  government  left  the  money  with them.  They  would  use  it,  they  claim,  to  open  new  factories  and  hire  the unemployed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this view, the wisest economic policy is to keep politics out of the economy, reduce  taxation  and  government  regulation  to  a  minimum,  and  allow  market forces free rein to take their course. Private investors, unencumbered by political considerations, will invest their money where they can get the most pro t, so the way  to  ensure  the  most  economic  growth  –  which  will  bene t  everyone, industrialists and workers – is for the government to do as little as possible. This free-market  doctrine  is  today  the  most  common  and  in uential  variant  of  the capitalist  creed.  The  most  enthusiastic  advocates  of  the free  market  criticise military  adventures  abroad  with  as  much  zeal  as  welfare  programmes  at  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They o er governments the same advice that Zen masters o er initiates: just do nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in its extreme form, belief in the free market is as naïve as belief in Santa Claus. There simply is no such thing as a market free of all political bias. The most important economic resource is trust in the future, and this resource is constantly threatened by thieves and charlatans. Markets by themselves o er no protection against fraud, theft and violence. It is the job of political systems to ensure trust by legislating sanctions against cheats and to establish and support police forces, courts and jails which will enforce the law. When kings fail to do their jobs and regulate  the  markets  properly,  it  leads  to  loss  of  trust,  dwindling  credit  and economic  depression.  That  was  the  lesson  taught  by  the  Mississippi  Bubble  of 1719, and anyone who forgot it was reminded by the US housing bubble of 2007, and the ensuing credit crunch and recession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Capitalist Hel</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is an even more fundamental reason why it’s dangerous to give markets a completely free rein. Adam Smith taught that the shoemaker would use his surplus to  employ  more  assistants.  This  implies  that  egoistic  greed  is  bene cial  for  all, since profits are utilised to expand production and hire more employees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  what  happens  if  the  greedy  shoemaker  increases  his  pro ts  by  paying employees less and increasing their work hours? The standard answer is that the free  market  would  protect  the  employees.  If  our  shoemaker  pays  too  little  and demands too much, the best employees would naturally abandon him and go to</p>
<p class="calibre1">work for his competitors. The tyrant shoemaker would  nd himself left with the worst labourers, or with no labourers at all. He would have to mend his ways or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a>go out of business. His own greed would compel him to treat his employees well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This sounds bulletproof in theory, but in practice the bullets get through all too easily. In a completely free market, unsupervised by kings and priests, avaricious capitalists can establish monopolies or collude against their workforces. If there is a  single  corporation  controlling  all  shoe  factories  in  a  country,  or  if  all  factory owners conspire to reduce wages simultaneously, then the labourers are no longer able to protect themselves by switching jobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  worse,  greedy  bosses  might  curtail  the  workers’  freedom  of  movement through  debt  peonage  or  slavery.  At  the  end  of  the  Middle  Ages,  slavery  was almost unknown in Christian Europe. During the early modern period, the rise of European capitalism went hand in hand with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unrestrained  market  forces,  rather  than  tyrannical  kings  or  racist  ideologues, were responsible for this calamity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Europeans conquered America, they opened gold and silver mines and established  sugar,  tobacco  and  cotton  plantations.  These  mines  and  plantations became the mainstay of American production and export. The sugar plantations were  particularly  important.  In  the  Middle  Ages,  sugar  was  a  rare  luxury  in Europe.  It  was  imported  from  the  Middle  East  at  prohibitive  prices  and  used sparingly as a secret ingredient in delicacies and snake-oil medicines. After large sugar plantations were established in America, ever-increasing amounts of sugar began  to  reach  Europe.  The  price  of  sugar  dropped  and  Europe  developed  an insatiable sweet tooth. Entrepreneurs met this need by producing huge quantities of  sweets:  cakes,  cookies,  chocolate,  candy,  and  sweetened  beverages  such  as cocoa,  co ee  and  tea.  The  annual  sugar  intake  of  the  average  Englishman  rose from near zero in the early seventeenth century to around eight kilograms in the early nineteenth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  growing  cane  and  extracting  its  sugar  was  a  labour-intensive business. Few people wanted to work long hours in malaria-infested sugar  elds under a tropical sun. Contract labourers would have produced a commodity too expensive for mass consumption. Sensitive to market forces, and greedy for pro ts and economic growth, European plantation owners switched to slaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, about 10 million African slaves were  imported  to  America.  About  70  per  cent  of  them  worked  on  the  sugar plantations.  Labour  conditions  were  abominable.  Most  slaves  lived  a  short  and miserable  life,  and  millions  more  died  during  wars  waged  to  capture  slaves  or during the long voyage from inner Africa to the shores of America. All this so that Europeans could enjoy their sweet tea and candy – and sugar barons could enjoy huge profits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The slave trade was not controlled by any state or government. It was a purely economic enterprise, organised and  nanced by the free market according to the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a>laws of supply and demand. Private slave-trading companies sold shares on the Amsterdam,  London  and  Paris  stock  exchanges.  Middle-class  Europeans  looking for a good investment bought these shares. Relying on this money, the companies bought  ships,  hired  sailors  and  soldiers,  purchased  slaves  in  Africa,  and transported them to America. There they sold the slaves to the plantation owners, using the proceeds to purchase plantation products such as sugar, cocoa, co ee, tobacco, cotton and rum. They returned to Europe, sold the sugar and cotton for a good  price,  and  then  sailed  to  Africa  to  begin  another  round.  The  shareholders were very pleased with this arrangement. Throughout the eighteenth century the yield  on  slave-trade  investments  was  about  6  per  cent  a  year  –  they  were extremely profitable, as any modern consultant would be quick to admit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the  y in the ointment of free-market capitalism. It cannot ensure that pro ts are gained in a fair way, or distributed in a fair manner. On the contrary, the  craving  to  increase  pro ts  and  production  blinds  people  to  anything  that might stand in the way. When growth becomes a supreme good, unrestricted by any other ethical considerations, it can easily lead to catastrophe. Some religions, such  as  Christianity  and  Nazism,  have  killed  millions  out  of  burning  hatred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Capitalism  has  killed  millions  out  of  cold  indi erence  coupled  with  greed.  The Atlantic  slave  trade  did  not  stem  from  racist  hatred  towards  Africans.  The individuals who bought the shares, the brokers who sold them, and the managers of the slave-trade companies rarely thought about the Africans. Nor did the owners of the sugar plantations. Many owners lived far from their plantations, and the only information they demanded were neat ledgers of profits and losses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  important  to  remember  that  the  Atlantic  slave  trade  was  not  a  single aberration in an otherwise spotless record. The Great Bengal Famine, discussed in the  previous  chapter,  was  caused  by  a  similar  dynamic  –  the  British  East  India Company cared more about its pro ts than about the lives of 10 million Bengalis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">VOC’s  military  campaigns  in  Indonesia  were  nanced  by  upstanding  Dutch burghers who loved their children, gave to charity, and enjoyed good music and ne art, but had no regard for the su ering of the inhabitants of Java, Sumatra and Malacca. Countless other crimes and misdemeanours accompanied the growth of the modern economy in other parts of the planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The nineteenth century brought no improvement in the ethics of capitalism. The Industrial Revolution that swept through Europe enriched the bankers and capital-owners,  but  condemned  millions  of  workers  to  a  life  of  abject  poverty.  In  the European colonies things were even worse. In 1876, King Leopold II of Belgium set  up  a  nongovernmental  humanitarian  organisation  with  the  declared  aim  of exploring  Central  Africa  and  ghting  the  slave  trade  along  the  Congo  River.  It was also charged with improving conditions for the inhabitants of the region by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a>building roads, schools and hospitals. In 1885 the European powers agreed to give this organisation control of 2.3 million square kilometres in the Congo basin. This territory,  seventy- ve  times  the  size  of  Belgium,  was  henceforth  known  as  the Congo  Free  State.  Nobody  asked  the  opinion  of  the  territory’s  20–30  million inhabitants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within a short time the humanitarian organisation became a business enterprise whose real aim was growth and pro t. The schools and hospitals were forgotten, and the Congo basin was instead  lled with mines and plantations, run by mostly Belgian o cials who ruthlessly exploited the local population. The rubber industry was  particularly  notorious.  Rubber  was  fast  becoming  an  industrial  staple,  and rubber  export  was  the  Congo’s  most  important  source  of  income.  The  African villagers  who  collected  the  rubber  were  required  to  provide  higher  and  higher quotas.  Those  who  failed  to  deliver  their  quota  were  punished  brutally  for  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘laziness’.  Their  arms  were  chopped  o   and  occasionally  entire  villages  were massacred. According to the most moderate estimates, between 1885 and 1908 the pursuit of growth and pro ts cost the lives of 6 million individuals (at least 20 per cent of the Congo’s population). Some estimates reach up to 10 million deaths. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">After 1908, and especially after 1945, capitalist greed was somewhat reined in, not  least  due  to  the  fear  of  Communism.  Yet  inequities  are  still  rampant.  The economic  pie  of  2014  is  far  larger  than  the  pie  of  1500,  but  it  is  distributed  so unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after a hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago. Much like the Agricultural Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to be a colossal fraud. The human species and the global economy may well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Capitalism  has  two  answers  to  this  criticism.  First,  capitalism  has  created  a world that nobody but a capitalist is capable of running. The only serious attempt to  manage  the  world  di erently  –  Communism  –  was  so  much  worse  in  almost every conceivable way that nobody has the stomach to try again. In 8500 BC one could cry bitter tears over the Agricultural Revolution, but it was too late to give up agriculture. Similarly, we may not like capitalism, but we cannot live without it.The second answer is that we just need more patience – paradise, the capitalists promise, is right around the corner. True, mistakes have been made, such as the Atlantic slave trade and the exploitation of the European working class. But we have learned our lesson, and if we just wait a little longer and allow the pie to grow  a  little  bigger,  everybody  will  receive  a  fatter  slice.  The  division  of  spoils will never be equitable, but there will be enough to satisfy every man, woman and child – even in the Congo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  are,  indeed,  some  positive  signs.  At  least  when  we  use  purely  material</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>criteria – such as life expectancy, child mortality and calorie intake – the standard of living of the average human in 2014 is signi cantly higher than it was in 1914, despite the exponential growth in the number of humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet can the economic pie grow inde nitely? Every pie requires raw materials and energy. Prophets of doom warn that sooner or later  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> will exhaust the raw materials and energy of planet Earth. And what will happen then? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a><b class="calibre3">17</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Wheels of Industry</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE MODERN ECONOMY GROWS THANKS to our trust in the future and to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">willingness of capitalists to reinvest their pro ts in production. Yet that does not su ce. Economic growth also requires energy and raw materials, and these are finite. When and if they run out, the entire system will collapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  evidence  provided  by  the  past  is  that  they  are  nite  only  in  theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Counter-intuitively,  while  humankind’s  use  of  energy  and  raw  materials  has mushroomed in the last few centuries, the amounts available for our exploitation have  actually  <i class="calibre4">increased</i>.  Whenever  a  shortage  of  either  has  threatened  to  slow economic  growth,  investments  have  owed  into  scienti c  and  technological research.  These  have  invariably  produced  not  only  more  e cient  ways  of exploiting  existing  resources,  but  also  completely  new  types  of  energy  and materials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider  the  vehicle  industry.  Over  the  last  300  years,  humankind  has manufactured billions of vehicles – from carts and wheelbarrows, to trains, cars, supersonic jets and space shuttles. One might have expected that such a prodigious e ort would have exhausted the energy sources and raw materials available for vehicle production, and that today we would be scraping the bottom of the barrel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  the  opposite  is  the  case.  Whereas  in  1700  the  global  vehicle  industry  relied overwhelmingly  on  wood  and  iron,  today  it  has  at  its  disposal  a  cornucopia  of new-found  materials  such  as  plastic,  rubber,  aluminium  and  titanium,  none  of which our ancestors even knew about. Whereas in 1700 carts were built mainly by the  muscle  power  of  carpenters  and  smiths,  today  the  machines  in  Toyota  and Boeing factories  are  powered  by  petroleum  combustion  engines  and  nuclear power stations. A similar revolution has swept almost all other  elds of industry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We call it the Industrial Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  millennia  prior  to  the  Industrial  Revolution,  humans  already  knew  how  to make use of a large variety of energy sources. They burned wood in order to smelt iron,  heat  houses  and  bake  cakes.  Sailing  ships  harnessed  wind  power  to  move around,  and  watermills  captured  the  ow  of  rivers  to  grind  grain.  Yet  all  these had  clear  limits  and  problems.  Trees  were  not  available  everywhere,  the  wind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>didn’t always blow when you needed it, and water power was only useful if you lived near a river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An even bigger problem was that people didn’t know how to convert one type</p>
<p class="calibre1">of energy into another. They could harness the movement of wind and water to sail  ships  and  push  millstones,  but  not  to  heat  water  or  smelt  iron.  Conversely, they could not use the heat energy produced by burning wood to make a millstone move.  Humans  had  only  one  machine  capable  of  performing  such  energy conversion  tricks:  the  body.  In  the  natural  process  of  metabolism,  the  bodies  of humans  and  other  animals  burn  organic  fuels  known  as  food  and  convert  the released  energy  into  the  movement  of  muscles.  Men,  women  and  beasts  could consume grain and meat, burn up their carbohydrates and fats, and use the energy to haul a rickshaw or pull a plough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  human  and  animal  bodies  were  the  only  energy  conversion  device available,  muscle  power  was  the  key  to  almost  all  human  activities.  Human muscles  built  carts  and  houses,  ox  muscles  ploughed  elds,  and  horse  muscles transported  goods.  The  energy  that  fuelled  these  organic  muscle-machines  came ultimately from a single source – plants. Plants in their turn obtained their energy from  the  sun.  By  the  process  of  photosynthesis,  they  captured  solar  energy  and packed  it  into  organic  compounds.  Almost  everything  people  did  throughout history  was  fuelled  by  solar  energy  that  was  captured  by  plants  and  converted into muscle power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Human  history  was  consequently  dominated  by  two  main  cycles:  the  growth cycles of plants and the changing cycles of solar energy (day and night, summer and  winter).  When  sunlight  was  scarce  and when  wheat  elds  were  still  green, humans had little energy. Granaries were empty, tax collectors were idle, soldiers found it di cult to move and  ght, and kings tended to keep the peace. When the sun shone brightly and the wheat ripened, peasants harvested the crops and  lled the  granaries.  Tax  collectors  hurried  to  take  their  share.  Soldiers  exed  their muscles and sharpened their swords. Kings convened councils and planned their next campaigns. Everyone was fuelled by solar energy – captured and packaged in wheat, rice and potatoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Secret in the Kitchen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout these long millennia, day in and day out, people stood face to face with the most important invention in the history of energy production – and failed to notice it. It stared them in the eye every time a housewife or servant put up a kettle to boil water for tea or put a pot full of potatoes on the stove. The minute</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a>the water boiled, the lid of the kettle or the pot jumped. Heat was being converted to movement. But jumping pot lids were an annoyance, especially if you forgot the pot on the stove and the water boiled over. Nobody saw their real potential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  partial  breakthrough  in  converting  heat  into  movement  followed  the invention  of  gunpowder  in  ninth-century  China.  At  rst,  the  idea  of  using gunpowder  to  propel  projectiles  was  so  counter-intuitive  that  for  centuries gunpowder was used primarily to produce  re bombs. But eventually – perhaps after  some  bomb  expert  ground  gunpowder  in  a  mortar  only  to  have  the  pestle shoot  out  with  force  –  guns  made  their  appearance.  About  600  years  passed between the invention of gunpowder and the development of effective artillery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  then,  the  idea  of  converting  heat  into  motion  remained  so  counter-intuitive  that  another  three  centuries  went  by  before  people  invented  the  next machine that used heat to move things around. The new technology was born in British coal mines. As the British population swelled, forests were cut down to fuel the growing economy and make way for houses and  elds. Britain su ered from an increasing shortage of  rewood. It began burning coal as a substitute. Many coal  seams  were  located  in  waterlogged  areas,  and  ooding  prevented  miners from  accessing  the  lower  strata  of  the  mines.  It  was  a  problem  looking  for  a solution.  Around  1700,  a  strange  noise  began  reverberating  around  British mineshafts.  That  noise  –  harbinger  of  the  Industrial  Revolution  –  was  subtle  at rst, but it grew louder and louder with each passing decade until it enveloped the entire world in a deafening cacophony. It emanated from a steam engine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  are  many  types  of  steam  engines,  but  they  all  share  one  common principle. You burn some kind of fuel, such as coal, and use the resulting heat to boil water, producing steam. As the steam expands it pushes a piston. The piston moves,  and  anything  that  is  connected  to  the  piston  moves  with  it.  You  have converted  heat  into  movement!  In  eighteenth-century  British  coal  mines,  the piston  was  connected  to  a  pump  that  extracted  water  from  the  bottom  of  the mineshafts. The earliest engines were incredibly ine cient. You needed to burn a huge load of coal in order to pump out even a tiny amount of water. But in the mines coal was plentiful and close at hand, so nobody cared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  decades  that  followed,  British  entrepreneurs  improved  the  e ciency  of the steam engine, brought it out of the mineshafts, and connected it to looms and gins.  This  revolutionised  textile  production,  making  it  possible  to  produce  ever-larger  quantities  of  cheap  textiles.  In  the  blink  of  an  eye,  Britain  became  the workshop of the world. But even more importantly, getting the steam engine out of the mines broke an important psychological barrier. If you could burn coal in order to move textile looms, why not use the same method to move other things, such as vehicles? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1825, a British engineer connected a steam engine to a train of mine wagons</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a>full  of  coal.  The  engine  drew  the  wagons  along  an  iron  rail  some  twenty kilometres  long  from  the  mine  to  the  nearest  harbour.  This  was  the  rst  steam-powered locomotive in history. Clearly, if steam could be used to transport coal, why not other goods? And why not even people? On 15 September 1830, the  rst commercial railway line was opened, connecting Liverpool with Manchester. The trains moved under the same steam power that had previously pumped water and moved textile looms. A mere twenty years later, Britain had tens of thousands of kilometres of railway tracks. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Henceforth,  people  became  obsessed  with  the  idea  that  machines  and  engines could  be  used  to  convert  one  type  of  energy  into  another.  Any  type  of  energy, anywhere in the world, might be harnessed to whatever need we had, if we could just  invent  the  right  machine.  For  example,  when  physicists  realised  that  an immense  amount  of  energy  is  stored  within  atoms,  they  immediately  started thinking  about  how  this  energy  could  be  released  and  used  to  make  electricity, power  submarines  and  annihilate  cities.  Six  hundred  years  passed  between  the moment  Chinese  alchemists  discovered  gunpowder  and  the  moment  Turkish cannon pulverised the walls of Constantinople. Only forty years passed between the  moment  Einstein  determined  that  any  kind  of  mass  could  be  converted  into energy – that’s what E = mc2 means – and the moment atom bombs obliterated</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki  and  nuclear  power  stations  mushroomed  all  over  the globe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another crucial discovery was the internal combustion engine, which took little more than a generation to revolutionise human transportation and turn petroleum into liquid political power. Petroleum had been known for thousands of years, and was  used  to  waterproof  roofs  and  lubricate  axles.  Yet  until  just  a  century  ago nobody thought it was useful for much more than that. The idea of spilling blood for the sake of oil would have seemed ludicrous. You might  ght a war over land, gold, pepper or slaves, but not oil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  career  of  electricity  was  more  startling  yet.  Two  centuries  ago  electricity played  no  role  in  the  economy,  and  was  used  at  most  for  arcane  scienti c experiments  and  cheap  magic  tricks.  A  series  of  inventions  turned  it  into  our universal  genie  in  a  lamp.  We  ick  our  ngers  and  it  prints  books  and  sews clothes,  keeps  our  vegetables  fresh  and  our  ice  cream  frozen,  cooks  our  dinners and executes our criminals, registers our thoughts and records our smiles, lights up our nights and entertains us with countless television shows. Few of us understand how electricity does all these things, but even fewer can imagine life without it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An Ocean of Energy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a>At heart, the Industrial Revolution has been a revolution in energy conversion. It has demonstrated again and again that there is no limit to the amount of energy at  our  disposal.  Or,  more  precisely,  that  the  only  limit  is  set  by  our  ignorance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  few  decades  we  discover  a  new  energy  source,  so  that  the  sum  total  of energy at our disposal just keeps growing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why are so many people afraid that we are running out of energy? Why do they warn of disaster if we exhaust all available fossil fuels? Clearly the world does not lack energy. All we lack is the knowledge necessary to harness and convert it to our needs. The amount of energy stored in all the fossil fuel on earth is negligible compared to the amount that the sun dispenses every day, free of charge. Only a tiny  proportion  of  the  sun’s  energy  reaches  us,  yet  it  amounts  to  3,766,800</p>
<p class="calibre1">exajoules of energy each year (a joule is a unit of energy in the metric system, about  the  amount  you  expend  to  lift  a  small  apple  one  yard  straight  up;  an exajoule is a billion billion joules – that’s a lot of apples). <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">2 </a>All the world’s plants capture  only  about  3,000  of  those  solar  exajoules  through  the  process  of photosynthesis. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">3  </a>All  human  activities  and  industries  put  together  consume  about 500 exajoules annually, equivalent to the amount of energy earth receives from the sun in just ninety minutes. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">4 </a>And that’s only solar energy. In addition, we are surrounded  by  other  enormous  sources  of  energy,  such  as  nuclear  energy  and gravitational  energy,  the  latter  most  evident  in  the  power  of  the  ocean  tides caused by the moon’s pull on the earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prior  to  the  Industrial  Revolution,  the  human  energy  market  was  almost completely dependent on plants. People lived alongside a green energy reservoir carrying 3,000 exajoules a year, and tried to pump as much of its energy as they could.  Yet  there  was  a  clear  limit  to  how  much  they  could  extract.  During  the Industrial Revolution, we came to realise that we are actually living alongside an enormous  ocean  of  energy,  one  holding  billions  upon  billions  of  exajoules  of potential power. All we need to do is invent better pumps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Learning how to harness and convert energy e ectively solved the other problem that slows economic growth – the scarcity of raw materials. As humans worked out how  to  harness  large  quantities  of  cheap  energy,  they  could  begin  exploiting previously inaccessible deposits of raw materials (for example, mining iron in the Siberian  wastelands),  or  transporting  raw  materials  from  ever  more  distant locations  (for  example,  supplying  a  British  textile  mill  with  Australian  wool). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simultaneously, scienti c breakthroughs enabled humankind to invent completely new  raw  materials,  such  as  plastic,  and  discover  previously  unknown  natural</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a>materials, such as silicon and aluminium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chemists discovered aluminium only in the 1820s, but separating the metal from its ore was extremely di cult and costly. For decades, aluminium was much more expensive than gold. In the 1860S, Emperor Napoleon III of France commissioned aluminium cutlery to be laid out for his most distinguished guests. Less important visitors  had  to  make  do  with  the  gold  knives  and  forks. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">5  </a>But  at  the  end  of  the nineteenth  century  chemists  discovered  a  way  to  extract  immense  amounts  of cheap  aluminium,  and  current  global  production  stands  at  30  million  tons  per year. Napoleon III would be surprised to hear that his subjects’ descendants use cheap  disposable  aluminium  foil  to  wrap  their  sandwiches  and  put  away  their leftovers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Almost  all  of  these  ingredients  were  invented  or  discovered  in  the  last  two centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  World  War  One,  Germany  was  placed  under  blockade and  su ered severe shortages of raw materials, in particular saltpetre, an essential ingredient in gunpowder and other explosives. The most important saltpetre deposits were in Chile  and  India;  there  were  none  at  all  in  Germany.  True,  saltpetre  could  be replaced by ammonia, but that was expensive to produce as well. Luckily for the Germans, one of their fellow citizens, a Jewish chemist named Fritz Haber, had discovered  in  1908  a  process  for  producing  ammonia  literally  out  of  thin  air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When war broke out, the Germans used Haber’s discovery to commence industrial production of explosives using air as a raw material. Some scholars believe that if it  hadn’t  been  for  Haber’s  discovery,  Germany  would  have  been  forced  to surrender long before November 1918. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">6 </a>The discovery won Haber (who during the war  also  pioneered  the  use  of  poison  gas  in  battle)  a  Nobel  Prize  in  1918.

<p class="calibre1">Life on the Conveyor Belt</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a>The  Industrial  Revolution  yielded  an  unprecedented  combination  of  cheap  and abundant  energy  and  cheap  and  abundant  raw  materials.  The  result  was  an explosion  in  human  productivity.  The  explosion  was  felt  rst  and  foremost  in agriculture. Usually, when we think of the Industrial Revolution, we think of an urban  landscape  of  smoking  chimneys,  or  the  plight  of  exploited  coal  miners sweating in the bowels of the earth. Yet the Industrial Revolution was above all else the Second Agricultural Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the last 200 years, industrial production methods became the mainstay of  agriculture.  Machines  such  as  tractors  began  to  undertake  tasks  that  were previously  performed  by  muscle  power,  or  not  performed  at  all.  Fields  and animals  became  vastly  more  productive  thanks  to  arti cial  fertilisers,  industrial insecticides  and  an  entire  arsenal  of  hormones  and  medications.  Refrigerators, ships  and  aeroplanes  have  made  it  possible  to  store  produce  for  months,  and transport it quickly and cheaply to the other side of the world. Europeans began to dine on fresh Argentinian beef and Japanese sushi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even plants and animals were mechanised. Around the time that  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> was elevated to divine status by humanist religions, farm animals stopped being viewed as living creatures that could feel pain and distress, and instead came to be treated as machines. Today these animals are often mass-produced in factory-like facilities, their bodies shaped in accordance with industrial needs. They pass their entire lives as cogs in a giant production line, and the length and quality of their  existence  is  determined  by  the  pro ts  and  losses  of  business  corporations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  when  the  industry  takes  care  to  keep  them  alive,  reasonably  healthy  and well fed, it has no intrinsic interest in the animals’ social and psychological needs (except when these have a direct impact on production). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Egg-laying hens, for example, have a complex world of behavioural needs and drives. They feel strong urges to scout their environment, forage and peck around, determine  social  hierarchies,  build  nests  and  groom  themselves.  But  the  egg industry often locks the hens inside tiny coops, and it is not uncommon for it to squeeze  four  hens  to  a  cage,  each  given  a  oor  space  of  about  twenty- ve  by twenty-two centimetres. The hens receive su cient food, but they are unable to claim  a  territory,  build  a  nest  or  engage  in  other  natural  activities.  Indeed,  the cage is so small that hens are often unable even to  ap their wings or stand fully erect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pigs  are  among  the  most  intelligent  and  inquisitive  of  mammals,  second perhaps  only  to  the  great  apes.  Yet  industrialised  pig  farms  routinely  con ne nursing sows inside such small crates that they are literally unable to turn around (not to mention walk or forage). The sows are kept in these crates day and night for  four  weeks  after  giving  birth.  Their  o spring  are  then  taken  away  to  be fattened up and the sows are impregnated with the next litter of piglets. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a><img src="index-292_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  dairy  cows  live  almost  all  their  allotted  years  inside  a  small  enclosure; standing,  sitting  and  sleeping  in  their  own  urine  and  excrement.  They  receive their measure of food, hormones and medications from one set of machines, and get milked every few hours by another set of machines. The cow in the middle is treated as little more than a mouth that takes in raw materials and an udder that produces  a  commodity.  Treating  living  creatures  possessing  complex  emotional worlds  as  if  they  were  machines  is  likely  to  cause  them  not  only  physical discomfort, but also much social stress and psychological frustration. <a href="index_split_005.html#p361">7</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">Just as the Atlantic slave trade did not stem from hatred towards Africans, so the modern animal industry is not motivated by animosity. Again, it is fuelled by indi erence. Most people who produce and consume eggs, milk and meat rarely stop  to  think  about  the  fate  of  the  chickens,  cows  or  pigs  whose  esh  and emissions they are eating. Those who do think often argue that such animals are really little di erent from machines, devoid of sensations and emotions, incapable of  su ering.  Ironically,  the  same  scienti c  disciplines  which  shape  our  milk machines  and  egg  machines  have  lately  demonstrated  beyond  reasonable  doubt that  mammals  and  birds  have  a  complex  sensory  and  emotional  make-up.  They not only feel physical pain, but can also suffer from emotional distress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evolutionary psychology maintains that the emotional and social needs of farm</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>animals  evolved  in  the  wild,  when  they  were  essential  for  survival  and reproduction. For example, a wild cow had to know how to form close relations with other cows and bulls, or else she could not survive and reproduce. In order to learn the necessary skills, evolution implanted in calves – as in the young of all other social mammals – a strong desire to play (playing is the mammalian way of learning social behaviour). And it implanted in them an even stronger desire to bond with their mothers, whose milk and care were essential for survival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What happens if farmers now take a young calf, separate her from her mother, put her in a closed cage, give her food, water and inoculations against diseases, and  then,  when  she  is  old  enough,  inseminate  her  with  bull  sperm?  From  an objective  perspective,  this  calf  no  longer  needs  either  maternal  bonding  or playmates in order to survive and reproduce. But from a subjective perspective, the calf still feels a very strong urge to bond with her mother and to play with other  calves.  If  these  urges  are  not  ful lled,  the  calf  su ers  greatly.  This  is  the basic lesson of evolutionary psychology: a need shaped in the wild continues to be felt  subjectively  even  if  it  is  no  longer  really  necessary  for  survival  and reproduction. The tragedy of industrial agriculture is that it takes great care of the objective needs of animals, while neglecting their subjective needs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  truth  of  this  theory  has  been  known  at  least  since  the  1950s,  when  the American  psychologist  Harry  Harlow  studied  the  development  of  monkeys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harlow  separated  infant  monkeys  from  their  mothers  several  hours  after  birth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The monkeys were isolated inside cages, and then raised by dummy mothers. In each cage, Harlow placed two dummy mothers. One was made of metal wires, and was  tted with a milk bottle from which the infant monkey could suck. The other was  made  of  wood  covered  with  cloth,  which  made  it  resemble  a  real  monkey mother,  but  it  provided  the  infant  monkey  with  no  material  sustenance whatsoever. It was assumed that the infants would cling to the nourishing metal mother rather than to the barren cloth one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Harlow’s surprise, the infant monkeys showed a marked preference for the cloth mother, spending most of their time with her. When the two mothers were placed in close proximity, the infants held on to the cloth mother even while they reached over to suck milk from the metal mother. Harlow suspected that perhaps the infants did so because they were cold. So he  tted an electric bulb inside the wire mother, which now radiated heat. Most of the monkeys, except for the very young ones, continued to prefer the cloth mother. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p368"><b class="calibre3">41. </b></a><b class="calibre3">One of Harlow’s orphaned monkeys clings to the cloth mother even while sucking milk from the</b> <b class="calibre3">metal mother</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Follow-up  research  showed  that  Harlow’s  orphaned  monkeys  grew  up  to  be emotionally  disturbed  even  though  they  had  received  all  the  nourishment  they required.  They  never  tted  into  monkey  society,  had  di culties  communicating with other monkeys, and su ered from high levels of anxiety and aggression. The conclusion was inescapable: monkeys must have psychological needs and desires that go beyond their material requirements, and if these are not ful lled, they will su er greatly. Harlow’s infant monkeys preferred to spend their time in the hands of the barren cloth mother because they were looking for an emotional bond and not  only  for  milk.  In  the  following  decades,  numerous  studies  showed  that  this conclusion applies not only to monkeys, but to other mammals, as well as birds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  present,  millions  of  farm  animals  are  subjected  to  the  same  conditions  as Harlow’s monkeys, as farmers routinely separate calves, kids and other youngsters from their mothers, to be raised in isolation. <a href="index_split_005.html#p362">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p295"></a>Altogether, tens of billions of farm animals live today as part of a mechanised assembly  line,  and  about  50  billion  of  them  are  slaughtered  annually.  These industrial  livestock  methods  have  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in  agricultural production and in human food reserves. Together with the mechanisation of plant cultivation, industrial animal husbandry is the basis for the entire modern socio-economic  order.  Before  the  industrialisation  of  agriculture,  most  of  the  food produced in fields and farms was ‘wasted’ feeding peasants and farmyard animals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  a  small  percentage  was  available  to  feed  artisans,  teachers,  priests  and bureaucrats. Consequently, in almost all societies peasants comprised more than 90  per  cent  of  the  population.  Following  the  industrialisation  of  agriculture,  a shrinking number of farmers was enough to feed a growing number of clerks and factory  hands.  Today  in  the  United  States,  only  2  per  cent  of  the  population makes a living from agriculture, yet this 2 per cent produces enough not only to feed  the  entire  US  population,  but  also  to  export  surpluses  to  the  rest  of  the world. <a href="index_split_005.html#p362">9 </a>Without the industrialisation of agriculture the urban Industrial Revolution could  never  have  taken  place  –  there  would  not  have  been  enough  hands  and brains to staff factories and offices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  those  factories  and  o ces  absorbed  the  billions  of  hands  and  brains  that were  released  from  eldwork,  they  began  pouring  out  an  unprecedented avalanche  of  products.  Humans  now  produce  far  more  steel,  manufacture  much more clothing, and build many more structures than ever before. In addition, they produce  a  mind-boggling  array  of  previously  unimaginable  goods,  such  as  light bulbs,  mobile  phones,  cameras  and  dishwashers.  For  the  rst  time  in  human history, supply began to outstrip demand. And an entirely new problem was born: who is going to buy all this stuff? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Age of Shopping</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  modern  capitalist  economy  must  constantly  increase  production  if  it  is  to survive,  like  a  shark  that  must  swim  or  su ocate.  Yet  it’s  not  enough  just  to produce.  Somebody  must  also  buy  the  products,  or  industrialists  and  investors alike will go bust. To prevent this catastrophe and to make sure that people will always buy whatever new stu  industry produces, a new kind of ethic appeared: consumerism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most people throughout history lived under conditions of scarcity. Frugality was thus their watchword. The austere ethics of the Puritans and Spartans are but two famous  examples.  A  good  person  avoided  luxuries,  never  threw  food  away,  and patched  up  torn  trousers  instead  of  buying  a  new  pair.  Only  kings  and  nobles</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p296"></a>allowed  themselves  to  renounce  such  values  publicly  and  conspicuously  aunt their riches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consumerism  sees  the  consumption  of  ever  more  products  and  services  as  a positive  thing.  It  encourages  people  to  treat  themselves,  spoil  themselves,  and even kill themselves slowly by overconsumption. Frugality is a disease to be cured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You don’t have to look far to see the consumer ethic in action – just read the back of  a  cereal  box.  Here’s  a  quote  from  a  box  of  one  of  my  favourite  breakfast cereals, produced by an Israeli firm, Telma:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes you need a treat. Sometimes you need a little extra energy. There are times to watch your weight and times when you’ve just got to have something … right now! Telma o ers a variety of tasty cereals just for you –</p>
<p class="calibre1">treats without remorse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same package sports an ad for another brand of cereal called Health Treats: Health Treats offers lots of grains, fruits and nuts for an experience that combines taste, pleasure and health. For an enjoyable treat in the middle of the day, suitable for a healthy lifestyle.  <i class="calibre4">A real treat with the wonderful taste of</i> <i class="calibre4">more</i> [emphasis in the original]. </p>
