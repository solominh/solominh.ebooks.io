<p class="calibre1">Throughout  most  of  history,  people  were  likely  to  be  have  been  repelled  rather than attracted by such a text. They would have branded it as sel sh, decadent and morally  corrupt.  Consumerism  has  worked  very  hard,  with  the  help  of  popular psychology  (‘Just  do  it!’)  to  convince  people  that  indulgence  is  good  for  you, whereas frugality is self-oppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has succeeded. We are all good consumers. We buy countless products that we don’t really need, and that until yesterday we didn’t know existed. Manufacturers deliberately design short-term goods and invent new and unnecessary models of perfectly  satisfactory  products  that  we  must  purchase  in  order  to  stay  ‘in’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shopping  has  become  a  favourite  pastime,  and  consumer  goods  have  become essential mediators in relationships between family members, spouses and friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Religious  holidays  such  as  Christmas  have  become  shopping  festivals.  In  the United  States,  even  Memorial  Day  –  originally  a  solemn  day  for  remembering fallen soldiers – is now an occasion for special sales. Most people mark this day by going  shopping,  perhaps  to  prove  that  the  defenders  of  freedom  did  not  die  in vain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  owering  of  the  consumerist  ethic  is  manifested  most  clearly  in  the  food market. Traditional agricultural societies lived in the awful shade of starvation. In the a uent world of today one of the leading health problems is obesity, which strikes  the  poor  (who  stu   themselves  with  hamburgers  and  pizzas)  even  more severely than the rich (who eat organic salads and fruit smoothies). Each year the US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a>the  hungry  people  in  the  rest  of  the  world.  Obesity  is  a  double  victory  for consumerism.  Instead  of  eating  little,  which  will  lead  to  economic  contraction, people  eat  too  much  and  then  buy  diet  products  –  contributing  to  economic growth twice over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How can we square the consumerist ethic with the capitalist ethic of the business person,  according  to  which  pro ts  should  not  be  wasted,  and  should  instead  be reinvested in production? It’s simple. As in previous eras, there is today a division of labour between the elite and the masses. In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally, minding  every  penny.  Today,  the  tables  have  turned.  The  rich  take  great  care managing  their  assets  and  investments,  while  the  less  well  heeled  go  into  debt buying cars and televisions they don’t really need. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The capitalist and consumerist ethics are two sides of the same coin, a merger of two  commandments.  The  supreme  commandment  of  the  rich  is  ‘Invest!’  The supreme commandment of the rest of us is ‘Buy!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  capitalist-consumerist  ethic  is  revolutionary  in  another  respect.  Most previous  ethical  systems  presented  people  with  a  pretty  tough  deal.  They  were promised  paradise,  but  only  if  they  cultivated  compassion  and  tolerance, overcame craving and anger, and restrained their sel sh interests. This was too tough for most. The history of ethics is a sad tale of wonderful ideals that nobody can  live  up  to.  Most  Christians  did  not  imitate  Christ,  most  Buddhists  failed  to follow  Buddha,  and  most  Confucians  would  have  caused  Confucius  a  temper tantrum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to their cravings and passions – and buy more and more. This is the  rst religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do we know that we’ll really get paradise in return? We’ve seen it on television. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a><b class="calibre3">18</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A Permanent Revolution</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OPENED up new ways to convert energy and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce  goods,  largely  liberating  humankind  from  its  dependence  on  the surrounding  ecosystem.  Humans  cut  down  forests,  drained  swamps,  dammed rivers,  ooded plains, laid down tens of thousands of kilometres of railroad tracks, and built skyscraping metropolises. As the world was moulded to  t the needs of <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>, habitats were destroyed and species went extinct. Our once green and blue planet is becoming a concrete and plastic shopping centre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, the earths continents are home to almost 7 billion Sapiens. If you took all these people and put them on a large set of scales, their combined mass would be about 300 million tons. If you then took all our domesticated farmyard animals</p>
<p class="calibre1">–  cows,  pigs,  sheep  and  chickens  –  and  placed  them  on  an  even  larger  set  of scales,  their  mass  would  amount  to  about  700  million  tons.  In  contrast,  the combined  mass  of  all  surviving  large  wild  animals  –  from  porcupines  and penguins to elephants and whales – is less than 100 million tons. Our children’s books,  our  iconography  and  our  TV  screens  are  still  full  of  gira es,  wolves  and chimpanzees, but the real world has very few of them left. There are about 80,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">gira es  in  the  world,  compared  to  1.5  billion  cattle;  only  200,000  wolves, compared  to  400  million  domesticated  dogs;  only  250,000  chimpanzees  –  in contrast to billions of humans. Humankind really has taken over the world. <a href="#p362">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ecological degradation is not the same as resource scarcity. As we saw in the previous chapter, the resources available to humankind are constantly increasing, and are likely to continue to do so. That’s why doomsday prophesies of resource scarcity are probably misplaced. In contrast, the fear of ecological degradation is only too well founded. The future may see Sapiens gaining control of a cornucopia of  new  materials  and  energy  sources,  while  simultaneously  destroying  what remains of the natural habitat and driving most other species to extinction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  ecological  turmoil  might  endanger  the  survival  of  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Global warming, rising oceans and widespread pollution could make the earth less hospitable  to  our  kind,  and  the  future  might  consequently  see  a  spiralling  race between human power and human-induced natural disasters. As humans use their power to counter the forces of nature and subjugate the ecosystem to their needs</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a>and  whims,  they  might  cause  more  and  more  unanticipated  and  dangerous  side e ects.  These  are  likely  to  be  controllable  only  by  even  more  drastic manipulations of the ecosystem, which would result in even worse chaos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many call this process ‘the destruction of nature’. But it’s not really destruction, it’s change. Nature cannot be destroyed. Sixty- ve million years ago, an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, but in so doing opened the way forward for mammals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,  humankind  is  driving  many  species  into  extinction  and  might  even annihilate itself. But other organisms are doing quite well. Rats and cockroaches, for example, are in their heyday. These tenacious creatures would probably creep out from beneath the smoking rubble of a nuclear Armageddon, ready and able to spread  their  DNA.  Perhaps  65  million  years  from  now,  intelligent  rats  will  look back gratefully on the decimation wrought by humankind, just as we today can thank that dinosaur-busting asteroid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,  the  rumours  of  our  own  extinction  are  premature.  Since  the  Industrial Revolution, the world’s human population has burgeoned as never before. In 1700</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world was home to some 700 million humans. In 1800 there were 950 million of us. By 1900 we almost doubled our numbers to 1.6 billion. And by 2000 that quadrupled to 6 billion. Today there are just shy of 7 billion Sapiens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern Time</p>
<p class="calibre1">While  all  these  Sapiens  have  grown  increasingly  impervious  to  the  whims  of nature,  they  have  become  ever  more  subject  to  the  dictates  of  modern  industry and  government.  The  Industrial  Revolution  opened  the  way  to  a  long  line  of experiments  in  social  engineering  and  an  even  longer  series  of  unpremeditated changes  in  daily  life  and  human  mentality.  One  example  among  many  is  the replacement of the rhythms of traditional agriculture with the uniform and precise schedule of industry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Traditional agriculture depended on cycles of natural time and organic growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  societies  were  unable  to  make  precise  time  measurements,  nor  were  they terribly interested in doing so. The world went about its business without clocks and timetables, subject only to the movements of the sun and the growth cycles of plants. There was no uniform working day, and all routines changed drastically from season to season. People knew where the sun was, and watched anxiously for portents of the rainy season and harvest time, but they did not know the hour and hardly cared about the year. If a lost time traveller popped up in a medieval village  and  asked  a  passerby,  ‘What  year  is  this?’  the  villager  would  be  as bewildered by the question as by the strangers ridiculous clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a><img src="index-300_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast to medieval peasants and shoemakers, modern industry cares little about the sun or the season. It sancti es precision and uniformity. For example, in a medieval workshop each shoemaker made an entire shoe, from sole to buckle. If one  shoemaker  was  late  for  work,  it  did  not  stall  the  others.  However,  in  a modern  footwear-factory  assembly  line,  every  worker  mans  a  machine  that produces just a small part of a shoe, which is then passed on to the next machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  the  worker  who  operates  machine  no.  5  has  overslept,  it  stalls  all  the  other machines. In order to prevent such calamities, everybody must adhere to a precise timetable. Each worker arrives at work at exactly the same time. Everybody takes their lunch break together, whether they are hungry or not. Everybody goes home when  a  whistle  announces  that  the  shift  is  over  –  not  when  they  have  nished their project. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p368"><b class="calibre3">42. </b></a><b class="calibre3">Charlie Chaplin as a simple worker caught in the wheels of the industrial assembly line, from the film</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Modern Times</b></i> <b class="calibre3">(1936)</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Industrial  Revolution  turned  the  timetable  and  the  assembly  line  into  a template for almost all human activities. Shortly after factories imposed their time frames on human behaviour, schools too adopted precise timetables, followed by hospitals,  government  o ces  and  grocery  stores.  Even  in  places  devoid  of assembly lines and machines, the timetable became king. If the shift at the factory ends at 5 p.m., the local pub had better be open for business by 5:02. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  crucial  link  in  the  spreading  timetable  system  was  public  transportation.  If workers  needed  to  start  their  shift  by  08:00,  the  train  or  bus  had  to  reach  the factory gate by 07:55. A few minutes’ delay would lower production and perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>even lead to the lay-o s of the unfortunate latecomers. In 1784 a carriage service with a published schedule began operating in Britain. Its timetable speci ed only the hour of departure, not arrival. Back then, each British city and town had its own local time, which could di er from London time by up to half an hour. When it  was  12:00  in  London,  it  was  perhaps  12:20  in  Liverpool  and  11:50  in Canterbury.  Since  there  were  no  telephones,  no  radio  or  television,  and  no  fast trains – who could know, and who cared? <a href="#p362">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst  commercial  train  service  began  operating  between  Liverpool  and Manchester  in  1830.  Ten  years  later,  the  rst  train  timetable  was  issued.  The trains were much faster than the old carriages, so the quirky di erences in local hours became a severe nuisance. In 1847, British train companies put their heads together  and  agreed  that  henceforth  all  train  timetables  would  be  calibrated  to Greenwich Observatory time, rather than the local times of Liverpool, Manchester or Glasgow. More and more institutions followed the lead of the train companies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, in 1880, the British government took the unprecedented step of legislating that all timetables in Britain must follow Greenwich. For the first time in history, a country adopted a national time and obliged its population to live according to an artificial clock rather than local ones or sunrise-to-sunset cycles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  modest  beginning  spawned  a  global  network  of  timetables,  synchronised down to the tiniest fractions of a second. When the broadcast media –  rst radio, then television – made their debut, they entered a world of timetables and became its main enforcers and evangelists. Among the  rst things radio stations broadcast were time signals, beeps that enabled far- ung settlements and ships at sea to set their  clocks.  Later,  radio  stations  adopted  the  custom  of  broadcasting  the  news every hour. Nowadays, the  rst item of every news broadcast – more important even than the outbreak of war – is the time. During World War Two, BBC News was broadcast to Nazi-occupied Europe. Each news programme opened with a live broadcast of Big Ben tolling the hour – the magical sound of freedom. Ingenious German  physicists  found  a  way  to  determine  the  weather  conditions  in  London based on tiny differences in the tone of the broadcast ding-dongs. This information o ered  invaluable  help  to  the  Luftwa e.  When  the  British  Secret  Service discovered this, they replaced the live broadcast with a set recording of the famous clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to run the timetable network, cheap but precise portable clocks became ubiquitous. In Assyrian, Sassanid or Inca cities there might have been at most a few  sundials.  In  European  medieval  cities  there  was  usually  a  single  clock  –  a giant machine mounted on top of a high tower in the town square. These tower clocks were notoriously inaccurate, but since there were no other clocks in town to contradict  them,  it  hardly  made  any  di erence.  Today,  a  single  a uent  family generally has more timepieces at home than an entire medieval country. You can</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>tell the time by looking at your wristwatch, glancing at your Android, peering at the alarm clock by your bed, gazing at the clock on the kitchen wall, staring at the microwave, catching a glimpse of the TV or DVD, or taking in the taskbar on your computer out of the corner of your eye. You need to make a conscious e ort  <i class="calibre4">not</i> to know what time it is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  typical  person  consults  these  clocks  several  dozen  times  a  day,  because almost everything we do has to be done on time. An alarm clock wakes us up at 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">a.m., we heat our frozen bagel for exactly  fty seconds in the microwave, brush our  teeth  for  three  minutes  until  the  electric  toothbrush  beeps,  catch  the  07:40</p>
<p class="calibre1">train  to  work,  run  on  the  treadmill  at  the  gym  until  the  beeper  announces  that half an hour is over, sit down in front of the TV at 7 p.m. to watch our favourite show,  get  interrupted  at  preordained  moments  by  commercials  that  cost  $1,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">per second, and eventually unload all our angst on a therapist who restricts our prattle to the now standard fifty-minute therapy hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Industrial  Revolution  brought  about  dozens  of  major  upheavals  in  human society. Adapting to industrial time is just one of them. Other notable examples include urbanisation, the disappearance of the peasantry, the rise of the industrial proletariat,  the  empowerment  of  the  common  person,  democratisation,  youth culture and the disintegration of patriarchy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet all of these upheavals are dwarfed by the most momentous social revolution that ever befell humankind: the collapse of the family and the local community and their replacement by the state and the market. As best we can tell, from the earliest  times,  more  than  a  million  years  ago,  humans  lived  in  small,  intimate communities, most of whose members were kin. The Cognitive Revolution and the Agricultural  Revolution  did  not  change  that.  They  glued  together  families  and communities  to  create  tribes,  cities,  kingdoms  and  empires,  but  families  and communities  remained  the  basic  building  blocks  of  all  human  societies.  The Industrial  Revolution,  on  the other  hand,  managed  within  little  more  than  two centuries  to  break  these  building  blocks  into  atoms.  Most  of  the  traditional functions of families and communities were handed over to states and markets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Col apse of the Family and the Community</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prior  to  the  Industrial  Revolution,  the  daily  life  of  most  humans  ran  its  course within three ancient frames: the nuclear family, the extended family and the local intimate  community. <a href="#p318">*  </a>Most  people  worked  in  the  family  business  –  the  family farm or the family workshop, for example – or they worked in their neighbours’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a>family businesses. The family was also the welfare system, the health system, the education system, the construction industry, the trade union, the pension fund, the insurance company, the radio, the television, the newspapers, the bank and even the police. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When a person fell sick, the family took care of her. When a person grew old, the family supported her, and her children were her pension fund. When a person died, the family took care of the orphans. If a person wanted to build a hut, the family lent a hand. If a person wanted to open a business, the family raised the necessary  money.  If  a  person  wanted  to  marry,  the  family  chose,  or  at  least vetted,  the  prospective  spouse.  If  con ict  arose  with  a  neighbour,  the  family muscled in. But if a person’s illness was too grave for the family to manage, or a new  business  demanded  too  large  an  investment,  or  the  neighbourhood  quarrel escalated to the point of violence, the local community came to the rescue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The community o ered help on the basis of local traditions and an economy of favours, which often di ered greatly from the supply and demand laws of the free market.  In  an  old-fashioned  medieval  community,  when  my  neighbour  was  in need, I helped build his hut and guard his sheep, without expecting any payment in  return.  When  I  was  in  need,  my  neighbour  returned  the  favour.  At  the  same time,  the  local  potentate  might  have  drafted  all  of  us  villagers  to  construct  his castle without paying us a penny. In exchange, we counted on him to defend us against brigands and barbarians. Village life involved many transactions but few payments. There were some markets, of course, but their roles were limited. You could buy rare spices, cloth and tools, and hire the services of lawyers and doctors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet less than 10 per cent of commonly used products and services were bought in the  market.  Most  human  needs  were  taken  care  of  by  the  family  and  the community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were also kingdoms and empires that performed important tasks such as waging  wars,  building  roads  and  constructing  palaces.  For  these  purposes  kings raised  taxes  and  occasionally  enlisted  soldiers  and  labourers.  Yet,  with  few exceptions,  they  tended  to  stay  out  of  the  daily  a airs  of  families  and communities. Even if they wanted to intervene, most kings could do so only with di culty. Traditional agricultural economies had few surpluses with which to feed crowds of government o cials, policemen, social workers, teachers and doctors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently,  most  rulers  did  not  develop  mass  welfare  systems,  health-care systems or educational systems. They left such matters in the hands of families and communities.  Even  on  rare  occasions  when  rulers  tried  to  intervene  more intensively in the daily lives of the peasantry (as happened, for example, in the Qin  Empire  in  China),  they  did  so  by  converting  family  heads  and  community elders into government agents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Often enough, transportation and communication di culties made it so di cult</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a>to intervene in the a airs of remote communities that many kingdoms preferred to cede even the most basic royal prerogatives – such as taxation and violence – to communities. The Ottoman Empire, for instance, allowed family vendettas to mete out  justice,  rather  than  supporting  a  large  imperial  police  force.  If  my  cousin killed  somebody,  the  victim’s  brother  might  kill  me  in  sanctioned  revenge.  The sultan in Istanbul or even the provincial pasha did not intervene in such clashes, as long as violence remained within acceptable limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  Chinese  Ming  Empire  (1368–1644),  the  population  was  organised  into the  <i class="calibre4">baojia</i> system. Ten families were grouped to form a  <i class="calibre4">jia</i>, and ten  <i class="calibre4">jia</i> constituted a <i class="calibre4">bao</i>.  When  a  member  of  a  <i class="calibre4">bao</i>  commited  a  crime,  other  <i class="calibre4">bao</i>  members  could  be punished for it, in particular the  <i class="calibre4">bao</i> elders. Taxes too were levied on the  <i class="calibre4">bao</i>, and it was the responsibility of the  <i class="calibre4">bao</i> elders rather than of the state o cials to assess the situation of each family and determine the amount of tax it should pay. From the  empire’s  perspective,  this  system  had  a  huge  advantage.  Instead  of maintaining thousands of revenue o cials and tax collectors, who would have to monitor  the  earnings  and  expenses  of  every  family,  these  tasks  were  left  to  the community elders. The elders knew how much each villager was worth and they could usually enforce tax payments without involving the imperial army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  kingdoms  and  empires  were  in  truth  little  more  than  large  protection rackets. The king was the  <i class="calibre4">capo di tutti capi</i> who collected protection money, and in return made sure that neighbouring crime syndicates and local small fry did not harm those under his protection. He did little else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Life  in  the  bosom  of  family  and  community  was  far  from  ideal.  Families  and communities could oppress their members no less brutally than do modern states and  markets,  and  their  internal  dynamics  were  often  fraught  with  tension  and violence  –  yet  people  had  little  choice.  A  person  who  lost  her  family  and community around 1750 was as good as dead. She had no job, no education and no  support  in  times  of  sickness  and  distress.  Nobody  would  loan  her  money  or defend her if she got into trouble. There were no policemen, no social workers and no compulsory education. In order to survive, such a person quickly had to  nd an alternative family or community. Boys and girls who ran away from home could expect, at best, to become servants in some new family. At worst, there was the army or the brothel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  this  changed  dramatically  over  the  last  two  centuries.  The  Industrial Revolution  gave  the  market  immense  new  powers,  provided  the  state  with  new means  of  communication  and  transportation,  and  placed  at  the  government’s disposal  an  army  of  clerks,  teachers,  policemen  and  social  workers.  At  rst  the market  and  the  state  discovered  their  path  blocked  by  traditional  families  and communities who had little love for outside intervention. Parents and community</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>elders were reluctant to let the younger generation be indoctrinated by nationalist education  systems,  conscripted  into  armies  or  turned  into  a  rootless  urban proletariat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  time,  states  and  markets  used  their  growing  power  to  weaken  the traditional bonds of family and community. The state sent its policemen to stop family  vendettas  and  replace  them  with  court  decisions.  The  market  sent  its hawkers  to  wipe  out  longstanding  local  traditions  and  replace  them  with  ever-changing commercial fashions. Yet this was not enough. In order really to break the power of family and community, they needed the help of a fifth column. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  state  and  the  market  approached  people  with  an  o er  that  could  not  be refused.  ‘Become  individuals,’  they  said.  ‘Marry  whomever  you  desire,  without asking  permission  from  your  parents.  Take  up  whatever  job  suits  you,  even  if community  elders  frown.  Live  wherever  you  wish,  even  if  you  cannot  make  it every week to the family dinner. You are no longer dependent on your family or your community. We, the state and the market, will take care of you instead. We will  provide  food,  shelter,  education,  health,  welfare  and  employment.  We  will provide pensions, insurance and protection.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Romantic  literature  often  presents  the  individual  as  somebody  caught  in  a struggle against the state and the market. Nothing could be further from the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  state  and  the  market  are  the  mother  and  father  of  the  individual,  and  the individual  can  survive  only  thanks  to  them.  The  market  provides  us  with  work, insurance  and  a  pension.  If  we  want  to  study  a  profession,  the  government’s schools are there to teach us. If we want to open a business, the bank loans us money.  If  we  want  to  build  a  house,  a  construction  company  builds  it  and  the bank  gives  us  a  mortgage,  in  some  cases  subsidised  or  insured  by  the  state.  If violence  ares up, the police protect us. If we are sick for a few days, our health insurance takes care of us. If we are debilitated for months, social security steps in.  If  we  need  around-the-clock  assistance,  we  can  go  to  the  market  and  hire  a nurse – usually some stranger from the other side of the world who takes care of us with the kind of devotion that we no longer expect from our own children. If we have the means, we can spend our golden years at a senior citizens’ home. The tax authorities treat us as individuals, and do not expect us to pay the neighbours’</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxes. The courts, too, see us as individuals, and never punish us for the crimes of our cousins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only adult men, but also women and children, are recognised as individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout most of history, women were often seen as the property of family or community. Modern states, on the other hand, see women as individuals, enjoying economic  and  legal  rights  independently  of  their  family  and  community.  They may  hold  their  own  bank  accounts,  decide  whom  to  marry,  and  even  choose  to divorce or live on their own. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>But the liberation of the individual comes at a cost. Many of us now bewail the loss of strong families and communities and feel alienated and threatened by the power the impersonal state and market wield over our lives. States and markets composed  of  alienated  individuals  can  intervene  in  the  lives  of  their  members much  more  easily  than  states  and  markets  composed  of  strong  families  and communities.  When  neighbours  in  a  high-rise  apartment  building  cannot  even agree  on  how  much  to  pay  their  janitor,  how  can  we  expect  them  to  resist  the state? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The deal between states, markets and individuals is an uneasy one. The state and the market disagree about their mutual rights and obligations, and individuals complain  that  both  demand  too  much  and  provide  too  little.  In  many  cases individuals are exploited by markets, and states employ their armies, police forces and  bureaucracies  to  persecute  individuals  instead  of  defending  them.  Yet  it  is amazing  that  this  deal  works  at  all  –  however  imperfectly.  For  it  breaches countless  generations  of  human  social  arrangements.  Millions  of  years  of evolution  have  designed  us  to  live  and  think  as  community  members.  Within  a mere two centuries we have become alienated individuals. Nothing testi es better to the awesome power of culture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  nuclear  family  did  not  disappear  completely  from  the  modern  landscape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When states and markets took from the family most of its economic and political roles, they left it some important emotional functions. The modern family is still supposed  to  provide  for  intimate  needs,  which  state  and  market  are  (so  far) incapable  of  providing.  Yet  even  here  the  family  is  subject  to  increasing interventions.  The  market  shapes  to  an  ever-greater  degree  the  way  people conduct their romantic and sexual lives. Whereas traditionally the family was the main  matchmaker,  today  it’s  the  market  that  tailors  our  romantic  and  sexual preferences,  and  then  lends  a  hand  in  providing  for  them  –  for  a  fat  fee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Previously  bride  and  groom  met  in  the  family  living  room,  and  money  passed from the hands of one father to another. Today courting is done at bars and cafés, and  money  passes  from  the  hands  of  lovers  to  waitresses.  Even  more  money  is transferred to the bank accounts of fashion designers, gym managers, dieticians, cosmeticians  and  plastic  surgeons,  who  help  us  arrive  at  the  café  looking  as similar as possible to the markets ideal of beauty. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p307"></a><img src="index-307_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Family and community vs. state and market</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  state,  too,  keeps  a  sharper  eye  on  family  relations,  especially  between parents and children. Parents are obliged to send their children to be educated by the state. Parents who are especially abusive or violent with their children may be restrained  by  the  state.  If  need  be,  the  state  may  even  imprison  the  parents  or transfer their children to foster families. Until not long ago, the suggestion that the  state  ought  to  prevent  parents  from  beating  or  humiliating  their  children would  have  been  rejected  out  of  hand  as  ludicrous  and  unworkable.  In  most societies parental authority was sacred. Respect of and obedience to one’s parents were among the most hallowed values, and parents could do almost anything they wanted,  including  killing  newborn  babies,  selling  children  into  slavery  and marrying  o   daughters  to  men  more  than  twice  their  age.  Today,  parental authority is in full retreat. Youngsters are increasingly excused from obeying their elders,  whereas  parents  are  blamed  for  anything  that  goes  wrong  in  the  life  of their child. Mum and Dad are about as likely to get o  in the Freudian courtroom as were defendants in a Stalinist show trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagined Communities</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the nuclear family, the community could not completely disappear from our world without any emotional replacement. Markets and states today provide most of the material needs once provided by communities, but they must also supply tribal bonds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Markets  and  states  do  so  by  fostering  ‘imagined  communities’  that  contain millions of strangers, and which are tailored to national and commercial needs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p308"></a>An  imagined  community  is  a  community  of  people  who  don’t  really  know  each other,  but  imagine  that  they  do.  Such  communities  are  not  a  novel  invention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kingdoms,  empires  and  churches  functioned  for  millennia  as  imagined communities.  In  ancient  China,  tens  of  millions  of  people  saw  themselves  as members of a single family, with the emperor as its father. In the Middle Ages, millions of devout Muslims imagined that they were all brothers and sisters in the great  community  of  Islam.  Yet  throughout  history,  such  imagined  communities played second  ddle to intimate communities of several dozen people who knew each other well. The intimate communities ful lled the emotional needs of their members and were essential for everyone’s survival and welfare. In the last two centuries, the intimate communities have withered, leaving imagined communities to fill in the emotional vacuum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two most important examples for the rise of such imagined communities are the nation and the consumer tribe. The nation is the imagined community of the state.  The  consumer  tribe  is  the  imagined  community  of  the  market.  Both  are <i class="calibre4">imagined</i> communities because it is impossible for all customers in a market or for all members of a nation really to know one another the way villagers knew one another  in  the  past.  No  German  can  intimately  know  the  other  80  million members of the German nation, or the other 500 million customers inhabiting the European  Common  Market  (which evolved  rst  into  the  European  Community and finally became the European Union). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consumerism  and  nationalism  work  extra  hours  to  make  us  imagine  that millions of strangers belong to the same community as ourselves, that we all have a  common  past,  common  interests  and  a  common  future.  This  isn’t  a  lie.  It’s imagination.  Like  money,  limited  liability  companies  and  human  rights,  nations and consumer tribes are inter-subjective realities. They exist only in our collective imagination, yet their power is immense. As long as millions of Germans believe in the existence of a German nation, get excited at the sight of German national symbols, retell German national myths, and are willing to sacri ce money, time and  limbs  for  the  German  nation,  Germany  will  remain  one  of  the  strongest powers in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The nation does its best to hide its imagined character. Most nations argue that they are a natural and eternal entity, created in some primordial epoch by mixing the soil of the motherland with the blood of the people. Yet such claims are usually exaggerated. Nations existed in the distant past, but their importance was much smaller  than  today  because  the  importance  of  the  state  was  much  smaller.  A resident of medieval Nuremberg might have felt some loyalty towards the German nation,  but  she  felt  far  more  loyalty  towards  her  family  and  local  community, which  took  care  of  most  of  her  needs.  Moreover,  whatever  importance  ancient nations may have had, few of them survived. Most existing nations evolved only</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p309"></a>after the Industrial Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Middle East provides ample examples. The Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Iraqi nations are the product of haphazard borders drawn in the sand by French and British diplomats who ignored local history, geography and economy. These diplomats  determined  in  1918  that  the  people  of  Kurdistan,  Baghdad  and  Basra would henceforth be ‘Iraqis’. It was primarily the French who decided who would be Syrian and who Lebanese. Saddam Hussein and Hafez el-Asad tried their best to promote and reinforce their Anglo-French-manufactured national consciousnesses, but their bombastic speeches about the allegedly eternal Iraqi and Syrian nations had a hollow ring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It goes without saying that nations cannot be created from thin air. Those who worked hard to construct Iraq or Syria made use of real historical, geographical and  cultural  raw  materials  –  some  of  which  are  centuries  and  millennia  old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saddam  Hussein  co-opted  the  heritage  of  the  Abbasid  caliphate  and  the Babylonian Empire, even calling one of his crack armoured units the Hammurabi Division. Yet that does not turn the Iraqi nation into an ancient entity. If I bake a cake from  our, oil and sugar, all of which have been sitting in my pantry for the past two months, it does not mean that the cake itself is two months old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  recent  decades,  national  communities  have  been  increasingly  eclipsed  by tribes of customers who do not know one another intimately but share the same consumption  habits  and  interests,  and  therefore  feel  part  of  the  same  consumer tribe  –  and  de ne  themselves  as  such.  This  sounds  very  strange,  but  we  are surrounded by examples. Madonna fans, for example, constitute a consumer tribe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They de ne themselves largely by shopping. They buy Madonna concert tickets, CDs, posters, shirts and ring tones, and thereby de ne who they are. Manchester United fans, vegetarians and environmentalists are other examples. They, too, are de ned  above  all  by  what  they  consume.  It  is  the  keystone  of  their  identity.  A German  vegetarian  might  well  prefer  to  marry  a  French  vegetarian  than  a German carnivore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perpetuum Mobile</p>
<p class="calibre1">The revolutions of the last two centuries have been so swift and radical that they have  changed  the  most  fundamental  characteristic  of  the  social  order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Traditionally,  the  social  order  was  hard  and  rigid.  ‘Order’  implied  stability  and continuity.  Swift  social  revolutions  were  exceptional,  and  most  social transformations resulted from the accumulation of numerous small steps. Humans tended to assume that the social structure was in exible and eternal. Families and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p310"></a>communities might struggle to change their place within the order, but the idea that you could change the fundamental structure of the order was alien. People tended  to  reconcile  themselves  to  the  status  quo,  declaring  that  ‘this  is  how  it always was, and this is how it always will be’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the last two centuries, the pace of change became so quick that the social order  acquired  a  dynamic  and  malleable  nature.  It  now  exists  in  a  state  of permanent  ux. When we speak of modern revolutions we tend to think of 1789</p>
<p class="calibre1">(the  French  Revolution),  1848  (the  liberal  revolutions)  or  1917  (the  Russian Revolution). But the fact is that, these days, every year is revolutionary. Today, even a thirty-year-old can honestly tell disbelieving teenagers, ‘When I was young, the  world  was  completely  di erent.’  The  Internet,  for  example,  came  into  wide usage only in the early 1990s, hardly twenty years ago. Today we cannot imagine the world without it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence  any  attempt  to  de ne  the  characteristics  of  modern  society  is  akin  to de ning  the  colour  of  a  chameleon.  The  only  characteristic  of  which  we  can  be certain is the incessant change. People have become used to this, and most of us think  about  the  social  order  as  something  exible,  which  we  can  engineer  and improve  at  will.  The  main  promise  of  premodern  rulers  was  to  safeguard  the traditional  order  or  even  to  go  back  to  some  lost  golden  age.  In  the  last  two centuries, the currency of politics is that it promises to destroy the old world and build a better one in its place. Not even the most conservative of political parties vows  merely  to  keep  things  as  they  are.  Everybody  promises  social  reform, educational reform, economic reform – and they often fulfil those promises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as geologists expect that tectonic movements will result in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, so might we expect that drastic social movements will result in bloody outbursts of violence. The political history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is often told as a series of deadly wars, holocausts and revolutions. Like a  child  in  new  boots  leaping  from  puddle  to  puddle,  this  view  sees  history  as leapfrogging from one bloodbath to the next, from World War One to World War Two to the Cold War, from the Armenian genocide to the Jewish genocide to the Rwandan genocide, from Robespierre to Lenin to Hitler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  truth  here,  but  this  all  too  familiar  list  of  calamities  is  somewhat misleading.  We  focus  too  much  on  the  puddles  and  forget  about  the  dry  land separating them. The late modern era has seen unprecedented levels not only of violence and horror, but also of peace and tranquillity. Charles Dickens wrote of the French Revolution that ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ This may be true not only of the French Revolution, but of the entire era it heralded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  especially  true  of  the  seven  decades  that  have  elapsed  since  the  end  of World  War  Two.  During  this  period  humankind  has  for  the  rst  time  faced  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a>possibility  of  complete  self-annihilation  and  has  experienced  a  fair  number  of actual wars and genocides. Yet these decades were also the most peaceful era in human history – and by a wide margin. This is surprising because these very same decades  experienced  more  economic,  social  and  political  change  than  any previous era. The tectonic plates of history are moving at a frantic pace, but the volcanoes are mostly silent. The new elastic order seems to be able to contain and even initiate radical structural changes without collapsing into violent conflict. <a href="#p362">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Peace in Our Time</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most people don’t appreciate just how peaceful an era we live in. None of us was alive a thousand years ago, so we easily forget how much more violent the world used  to  be.  And  as  wars  become  more  rare  they  attract  more  attention.  Many more  people  think  about  the  wars  raging  today  in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq  than about the peace in which most Brazilians and Indians live. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even more importantly, it’s easier to relate to the su ering of individuals than of entire populations. However, in order to understand macro-historical processes, we  need  to  examine  mass  statistics  rather  than  individual  stories.  In  the  year 2000,  wars  caused  the  deaths  of  310,000  individuals,  and  violent  crime  killed another  520,000.  Each  and  every  victim  is  a  world  destroyed,  a  family  ruined, friends and relatives scarred for life. Yet from a macro perspective these 830,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">victims comprised only 1.5 per cent of the 56 million people who died in 2000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  year  1.26  million  people  died  in  car  accidents  (2.25  per  cent  of  total mortality) and 815,000 people committed suicide (1.45 per cent). <a href="#p362">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  gures  for  2002  are  even  more  surprising.  Out  of  57  million dead,  only 172,000 people died in war and 569,000 died of violent crime (a total of 741,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">victims  of  human  violence).  In  contrast,  873,000  people  committed  suicide. <a href="#p362">5</a>  It turns  out  that  in  the  year  following  the  9/11  attacks,  despite  all  the  talk  of terrorism and war, the average person was more likely to kill himself than to be killed by a terrorist, a soldier or a drug dealer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In most parts of the world, people go to sleep without fearing that in the middle of  the  night  a  neighbouring  tribe  might  surround  their  village  and  slaughter everyone.  Well-o   British  subjects  travel  daily  from  Nottingham  to  London through Sherwood Forest without fear that a gang of merry green-clad brigands will  ambush  them  and  take  their  money  to  give  to  the  poor  (or,  more  likely, murder them and take the money for themselves). Students brook no canings from their teachers, children need not fear that they will be sold into slavery when their parents can’t pay their bills, and women know that the law forbids their husbands</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a>from  beating  them  and  forcing  them  to  stay  at  home.  Increasingly,  around  the world, these expectations are fulfilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The decline of violence is due largely to the rise of the state. Throughout history, most violence resulted from local feuds between families and communities. (Even today,  as  the  above  gures  indicate,  local  crime  is  a  far  deadlier  threat  than international  wars.)  As  we  have  seen,  early  farmers,  who  knew  no  political organisations  larger  than  the  local  community,  su ered  rampant  violence. <a href="#p362">6  </a>As kingdoms and empires became stronger, they reined in communities and the level of  violence  decreased.  In  the  decentralised  kingdoms  of  medieval  Europe,  about twenty to forty people were murdered each year for every 100,000 inhabitants. In recent  decades,  when  states  and  markets  have  become  all-powerful  and communities have vanished, violence rates have dropped even further. Today the global average is only nine murders a year per 100,000 people, and most of these murders  take  place  in  weak  states  such  as  Somalia  and  Colombia.  In  the centralised  states  of  Europe,  the  average  is  one  murder  a  year  per  100,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">people. <a href="#p362">7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are certainly cases where states use their power to kill their own citizens, and  these  often  loom  large  in  our  memories  and  fears.  During  the  twentieth century, tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people were killed by the security forces of their own states. Still, from a macro perspective, state-run courts and police forces have probably increased the level of security worldwide. Even in oppressive dictatorships, the average modern person is far less likely to die at the hands  of  another  person  than  in  premodern  societies.  In  1964  a  military dictatorship was established in Brazil. It ruled the country until 1985. During these twenty  years,  several  thousand  Brazilians  were  murdered  by  the  regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thousands more were imprisoned and tortured. Yet even in the worst years, the average Brazilian in Rio de Janeiro was far less likely to die at human hands than the  average  Waorani,  Arawete  or  Yanomamo.  The  Waorani,  Arawete  and Yanomamo  are  indigenous  people  who  live  in  the  depths  of  the  Amazon  forest, without  army,  police  or  prisons.  Anthropological  studies  have  indicated  that between  a  quarter  and  a  half  of  their  menfolk  die  sooner  or  later  in  violent conflicts over property, women or prestige. <a href="#p363">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial Retirement</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is perhaps debatable whether violence within states has decreased or increased since 1945. What nobody can deny is that international violence has dropped to an all-time low. Perhaps the most obvious example is the collapse of the European</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p313"></a>empires. Throughout history empires have crushed rebellions with an iron  st, and when  its  day  came,  a  sinking  empire  used  all  its  might  to  save  itself,  usually collapsing into a bloodbath. Its  nal demise generally led to anarchy and wars of succession.  Since  1945  most  empires  have  opted  for  peaceful  early  retirement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their process of collapse became relatively swift, calm and orderly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1945 Britain ruled a quarter of the globe. Thirty years later it ruled just a few small islands. In the intervening decades it retreated from most of its colonies in a peaceful and orderly manner. Though in some places such as Malaya and Kenya the British tried to hang on by force of arms, in most places they accepted the end of  empire  with  a  sigh  rather  than  with  a  temper  tantrum.  They  focused  their e orts not on retaining power, but on transferring it as smoothly as possible. At least some of the praise usually heaped on Mahatma Gandhi for his non-violent creed  is  actually  owed  to  the  British  Empire.  Despite  many  years  of  bitter  and often violent struggle, when the end of the Raj came, the Indians did not have to ght the British in the streets of Delhi and Calcutta. The empire’s place was taken by a slew of independent states, most of which have since enjoyed stable borders and have for the most part lived peacefully alongside their neighbours. True, tens of thousands of people perished at the hands of the threatened British Empire, and in several hot spots its retreat led to the eruption of ethnic con icts that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives (particularly in India). Yet when compared to the long-term  historical  average,  the  British  withdrawal  was  an  exemplar  of  peace and  order.  The  French  Empire  was  more  stubborn.  Its  collapse  involved  bloody rearguard actions in Vietnam and Algeria that cost hundreds of thousands of lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  the  French,  too,  retreated  from  the  rest  of  their  dominions  quickly  and peacefully, leaving behind orderly states rather than a chaotic free-for-all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Soviet  collapse  in  1989  was  even  more  peaceful,  despite  the  eruption  of ethnic  con ict  in  the  Balkans,  the  Caucasus  and  Central  Asia.  Never  before  has such a mighty empire disappeared so swiftly and so quietly. The Soviet Empire of 1989 had su ered no military defeat except in Afghanistan, no external invasions, no  rebellions,  nor  even  large-scale  Martin  Luther  King-style  campaigns  of  civil disobedience. The Soviets still had millions of soldiers, tens of thousands of tanks and  aeroplanes,  and  enough  nuclear  weapons  to  wipe  out  the  whole  of humankind several times over. The Red Army and the other Warsaw Pact armies remained loyal. Had the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev, given the order, the Red Army would have opened fire on the subjugated masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet the Soviet elite, and the Communist regimes through most of eastern Europe (Romania and Serbia were the exceptions), chose not to use even a tiny fraction of this military power. When its members realised that Communism was bankrupt, they  renounced  force,  admitted  their  failure,  packed  their  suitcases  and  went home.  Gorbachev  and  his  colleagues  gave  up  without  a  struggle  not  only  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a>Soviet conquests of World War Two, but also the much older tsarist conquests in the  Baltic,  the  Ukraine,  the  Caucasus  and  Central  Asia.  It  is  chilling  to contemplate  what  might  have  happened  if  Gorbachev  had  behaved  like  the Serbian leadership – or like the French in Algeria. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pax Atomica</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  independent  states  that  came  after  these  empires  were  remarkably uninterested in war. With very few exceptions, since 1945 states no longer invade other states in order to conquer and swallow them up. Such conquests had been the bread and butter of political history since time immemorial. It was how most great  empires  were  established,  and  how  most  rulers  and  populations  expected things to stay. But campaigns of conquest like those of the Romans, Mongols and Ottomans  cannot  take  place  today  anywhere  in  the  world.  Since  1945,  no independent country recognised by the UN has been conquered and wiped o  the map. Limited international wars still occur from time to time, and millions still die in wars, but wars are no longer the norm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many people believe that the disappearance of international war is unique to the  rich  democracies  of  western  Europe.  In  fact,  peace  reached  Europe  after  it prevailed  in  other  parts  of  the  world.  Thus  the  last  serious  international  wars between  South  American  countries  were  the  Peru-Ecuador  War  of  1941  and  the Bolivia-Paraguay War of 1932–5. And before that there hadn’t been a serious war between  South  American  countries  since  1879–84,  with  Chile  on  one  side  and Bolivia and Peru on the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We seldom think of the Arab world as particularly peaceful. Yet only once since the Arab countries won their independence has one of them mounted a full-scale invasion of another (the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990). There have been quite a few border clashes (e.g. Syria vs Jordan in 1970), many armed interventions of one in the a airs of another (e.g. Syria in Lebanon), numerous civil wars (Algeria, Yemen, Libya) and an abundance of coups and revolts. Yet there have been no full-scale  international  wars  among  the  Arab  states  except  the  Gulf  War.  Even widening  the  scope  to  include  the entire  Muslim  world  adds  only  one  more example,  the  Iran-Iraq  War.  There  was  no  Turkey—Iran  War,  Pakistan-Afghanistan War, or Indonesia-Malaysia War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Africa things are far less rosy. But even there, most con icts are civil wars and coups. Since African states won their independence in the 1960s and 1970s, very few countries have invaded one another in the hope of conquest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  have  been  periods  of  relative  calm  before,  as,  for  example,  in  Europe</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p315"></a><img src="index-315_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">between 1871 and 1914, and they always ended badly. But this time it is di erent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For real peace is not the mere absence of war. Real peace is the implausibility of war.  There  has  never  been  real  peace  in  the  world.  Between  1871  and  1914,  a European  war  remained  a  plausible  eventuality,  and  the  expectation  of  war dominated  the  thinking  of  armies,  politicians  and  ordinary  citizens  alike.  This foreboding  was  true  for  all  other  peaceful  periods  in  history.  An  iron  law  of international politics decreed, ‘For every two nearby polities, there is a plausible scenario that will cause them to go to war against one another within one year.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">This law of the jungle was in force in late nineteenth-century Europe, in medieval Europe,  in  ancient  China  and  in  classical  Greece.  If  Sparta  and  Athens  were  at peace in 450 BC, there was a plausible scenario that they would be at war by 449</p>
<p class="calibre1">BC.Today humankind has broken the law of the jungle. There is at last real peace, and  not  just  absence  of  war.  For  most  polities,  there  is  no  plausible  scenario leading  to  full-scale  con ict  within  one  year.  What  could  lead  to  war  between Germany and France next year? Or between China and Japan? Or between Brazil and Argentina? Some minor border clash might occur, but only a truly apocalyptic scenario  could  result  in  an  old-fashioned  full-scale  war  between  Brazil  and Argentina in 2014, with Argentinian armoured divisions sweeping to the gates of Rio, and Brazilian carpet-bombers pulverising the neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such wars might still erupt between several pairs of states, e.g. between Israel and Syria, Ethiopia and Eritrea, or the USA and Iran, but these are only the exceptions that prove the rule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  situation  might  of  course  change  in  the  future  and,  with  hindsight,  the world of today might seem incredibly naïve. Yet from a historical perspective, our very naïvety is fascinating. Never before has peace been so prevalent that people could not even imagine war. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a><img src="index-316_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Scholars  have  sought  to  explain  this  happy  development  in  more  books  and articles  than  you  would  ever  want  to  read  yourself,  and  they  have  identi ed several  contributing  factors.  First  and  foremost,  the  price  of  war  has  gone  up dramatically.  The  Nobel  Peace  Prize  to  end  all  peace  prizes  should  have  been given  to  Robert  Oppenheimer  and  his  fellow  architects  of  the  atomic  bomb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nuclear  weapons  have  turned  war  between  superpowers  into  collective  suicide, and made it impossible to seek world domination by force of arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, while the price of war soared, its pro ts declined. For most of history, polities  could  enrich  themselves  by  looting  or  annexing  enemy  territories.  Most wealth  consisted  of  elds,  cattle,  slaves  and  gold,  so  it  was  easy  to  loot  it  or occupy  it.  Today,  wealth  consists  mainly  of  human  capital,  technical  know-how and complex socio-economic structures such as banks. Consequently it is di cult to carry it off or incorporate it into one’s territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider California. Its wealth was initially built on gold mines. But today it is built on silicon and celluloid – Silicon Valley and the celluloid hills of Hollywood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  would  happen  if  the  Chinese  were  to  mount  an  armed  invasion  of California,  land  a  million  soldiers  on  the  beaches  of  San  Francisco  and  storm inland? They would gain little. There are no silicon mines in Silicon Valley. The wealth  resides  in  the  minds  of  Google  engineers  and  Hollywood  script  doctors, directors and special-e ects wizards, who would be on the  rst plane to Bangalore or Mumbai long before the Chinese tanks rolled into Sunset Boulevard. It is not coincidental that the few full-scale international wars that still take place in the world, such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, occur in places were wealth is old-fashioned material wealth. The Kuwaiti sheikhs could  ee abroad, but the oil  elds stayed put and were occupied. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While  war  became  less  pro table,  peace  became  more  lucrative  than  ever.  In traditional  agricultural  economies  long-distance  trade  and  foreign  investment were sideshows. Consequently, peace brought little pro t, aside from avoiding the costs of war. If, say, in 1400 England and France were at peace, the French did not have to pay heavy war taxes and to su er destructive English invasions, but otherwise it did not bene t their wallets. In modern capitalist economies, foreign trade and investments have become all-important. Peace therefore brings unique dividends. As long as China and the USA are at peace, the Chinese can prosper by selling products to the USA, trading in Wall Street and receiving US investments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Last  but  not  least,  a  tectonic  shift  has  taken  place  in  global  political  culture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  elites  in  history  –  Hun  chieftains,  Viking  noblemen  and  Aztec  priests,  for example  –  viewed  war  as  a  positive  good.  Others  viewed  it  as  evil,  but  an inevitable one, which we had better turn to our own advantage. Ours is the  rst time in history that the world is dominated by a peace-loving elite – politicians, business people, intellectuals and artists who genuinely see war as both evil and avoidable. (There were paci sts in the past, such as the early Christians, but in the rare cases that they gained power, they tended to forget about their requirement to ‘turn the other cheek’.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a positive feedback loop between all these four factors. The threat of nuclear holocaust fosters paci sm; when paci sm spreads, war recedes and trade ourishes; and trade increases both the pro ts of peace and the costs of war. Over time,  this  feedback  loop  creates  another  obstacle  to  war,  which  may  ultimately prove the most important of all. The tightening web of international connections erodes the independence of most countries, lessening the chance that any one of them  might  single-handedly  let  slip  the  dogs  of  war.  Most  countries  no  longer engage  in  full-scale  war  for  the  simple  reason  that  they  are  no  longer independent.  Though  citizens  in  Israel,  Italy,  Mexico  or  Thailand  may  harbour illusions  of  independence,  the  fact  is  that  their  governments  cannot  conduct independent  economic  or  foreign  policies,  and  they  are  certainly  incapable  of initiating and conducting full-scale war on their own. As explained in <a href="index_split_002.html#p164">Chapter 11</a>, we are witnessing the formation of a global empire. Like previous empires, this one, too, enforces peace within its borders. And since its borders cover the entire globe, the World Empire effectively enforces world peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, is the modern era one of mindless slaughter, war and oppression, typi ed by the trenches of World War One, the nuclear mushroom cloud over Hiroshima and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p318"></a>the gory manias of Hitler and Stalin? Or is it an era of peace, epitomised by the trenches never dug in South America, the mushroom clouds that never appeared over  Moscow and  New  York,  and  the  serene  visages  of  Mahatma  Gandhi  and Martin Luther King? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The answer is a matter of timing. It is sobering to realise how often our view of the  past  is  distorted  by  events  of  the  last  few  years.  If  this  chapter  had  been written in 1945 or 1962, it would probably have been much more glum. Since it was written in 2014, it takes a relatively buoyant approach to modern history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To satisfy both optimists and pessimists, we may conclude by saying that we are on the threshold of both heaven and hell, moving nervously between the gateway of the one and the anteroom of the other. History has still not decided where we will  end  up,  and  a  string  of  coincidences  might  yet  send  us  rolling  in  either direction. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And They Lived Happily Ever After</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE LAST 500 YEARS HAVE WITNESSED A breathtaking series of revolutions. The earth has been united into a single ecological and historical sphere. The economy has  grown  exponentially,  and  humankind  today  enjoys  the  kind  of  wealth  that used to be the stu  of fairy tales. Science and the Industrial Revolution have given humankind superhuman powers and practically limitless energy. The social order has  been  completely  transformed,  as  have  politics,  daily  life  and  human psychology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But are we happier? Did the wealth humankind accumulated over the last  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries  translate  into  a  new-found  contentment?  Did  the  discovery  of inexhaustible energy resources open before us inexhaustible stores of bliss? Going further  back,  have  the  seventy  or  so  turbulent  millennia  since  the  Cognitive Revolution made the world a better place to live? Was the late Neil Armstrong, whose footprint remains intact on the windless moon, happier than the nameless hunter-gatherer  who  30,000  years  ago  left  her  handprint  on  a  wall  in  Chauvet Cave?  If  not,  what  was  the  point  of  developing  agriculture,  cities,  writing, coinage, empires, science and industry? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historians seldom ask such questions. They do not ask whether the citizens of Uruk and Babylon were happier than their foraging ancestors, whether the rise of Islam  made  Egyptians  more  pleased  with  their  lives,  or  how  the  collapse  of  the European empires in Africa have in uenced the happiness of countless millions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet these are the most important questions one can ask of history. Most current ideologies and political programmes are based on rather  imsy ideas concerning the  real  source  of  human  happiness.  Nationalists believe  that  political  self-determination is essential for our happiness. Communists postulate that everyone would  be  blissful  under  the  dictatorship  of  the  proletariat.  Capitalists  maintain that  only  the  free  market  can  ensure  the  greatest  happiness  of  the  greatest number,  by  creating  economic  growth  and  material  abundance  and  by  teaching people to be self-reliant and enterprising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  would  happen  if  serious  research  were  to  disprove  these  hypotheses?  If economic growth and self-reliance do not make people happier, what’s the bene t of Capitalism? What if it turns out that the subjects of large empires are generally</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a>happier than the citizens of independent states and that, for example, Algerians were happier under French rule than under their own? What would that say about the process of decolonisation and the value of national self-determination? </p>
<p class="calibre1">These are all hypothetical possibilities, because so far historians have avoided raising these questions – not to mention answering them. They have researched the history of just about everything politics, society, economics, gender, diseases, sexuality,  food,  clothing  –  yet  they  have  seldom  stopped  to  ask  how  these influence human happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though  few  have  studied  the  long-term  history  of  happiness,  almost  every scholar  and  layperson  has  some  vague  preconception  about  it.  In  one  common view,  human  capabilities  have  increased  throughout  history.  Since  humans generally  use  their  capabilities  to  alleviate  miseries  and  ful l  aspirations,  it follows that we must be happier than our medieval ancestors, and they must have been happier than Stone Age hunter-gatherers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this progressive account is unconvincing. As we have seen, new aptitudes, behaviours  and  skills  do  not  necessarily  make  for  a  better  life.  When  humans learned  to  farm  in  the  Agricultural  Revolution,  their  collective  power  to  shape their environment increased, but the lot of many individual humans grew harsher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peasants had to work harder than foragers to eke out less varied and nutritious food, and they were far more exposed to disease and exploitation. Similarly, the spread of European empires greatly increased the collective power of humankind, by  circulating  ideas,  technologies  and  crops,  and  opening  new  avenues  of commerce.  Yet  this  was  hardly  good news  for  millions  of  Africans,  Native Americans  and  Aboriginal  Australians.  Given  the  proven  human  propensity  for misusing  power,  it  seems  naïve  to  believe  that  the  more  clout  people  have,  the happier they will be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some challengers of this view take a diametrically opposed position. They argue for  a  reverse  correlation  between  human  capabilities  and  happiness.  Power corrupts, they say, and as humankind gained more and more power, it created a cold mechanistic world ill-suited to our real needs. Evolution moulded our minds and bodies to the life of hunter-gatherers. The transition  rst to agriculture and then to industry has condemned us to living unnatural lives that cannot give full expression to our inherent inclinations and instincts, and therefore cannot satisfy our deepest yearnings. Nothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class can approach the wild excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on a successful mammoth hunt. Every new invention just puts another mile between us and the Garden of Eden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet this romantic insistence on seeing a dark shadow behind each invention is as dogmatic as the belief in the inevitability of progress. Perhaps we are out of touch with our inner hunter-gatherer, but it’s not all bad. For instance, over the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p321"></a>last two centuries modern medicine has decreased child mortality from 33 per cent to less than 5 per cent. Can anyone doubt that this made a huge contribution to the happiness not only of those children who would otherwise have died, but also of their families and friends? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A more nuanced position takes the middle road. Until the Scienti c Revolution there was no clear correlation between power and happiness. Medieval peasants may indeed have been more miserable than their hunter-gatherer forebears. But in the  last  few  centuries  humans  have  learned  to  use  their  capacities  more  wisely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  triumphs  of  modern  medicine  are  just  one  example.  Other  unprecedented achievements  include  the  steep  drop  in  violence,  the  virtual  disappearance  of international wars, and the near elimination of large-scale famines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet this, too, is an oversimpli cation. Firstly, it bases its optimistic assessment on a very small sample of years. The majority of humans began to enjoy the fruits of modern medicine no earlier than 1850, and the drastic drop in child mortality is a  twentieth-century  phenomenon.  Mass  famines  continued  to  blight  much  of humanity  up  to  the  middle  of  the  twentieth  century.  During  Communist  Chinas Great  Leap  Forward  of  1958–61,  somewhere  between  10  and  50  million  human beings starved to death. International wars became rare only after 1945, largely thanks  to  the  new  threat  of  nuclear  annihilation.  Hence,  though  the  last  few decades have been an unprecedented golden age for humanity, it is too early to know whether this represents a fundamental shift in the currents of history or an ephemeral eddy of good fortune. When judging modernity, it is all too tempting to take the viewpoint of a twenty- rst-century middle-class Westerner. We must not forget  the  viewpoints  of  a  nineteenth-century  Welsh  coal  miner,  Chinese  opium addict  or  Tasmanian  Aborigine.  Truganini  is  no  less  important  than  Homer Simpson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly,  even  the  brief  golden  age  of  the  last  half-century  may  turn  out  to have  sown  the  seeds  of  future  catastrophe.  Over  the  last  few  decades,  we  have been disturbing the ecological equilibrium of our planet in myriad new ways, with what seem likely to be dire consequences. A lot of evidence indicates that we are destroying  the  foundations  of  human  prosperity  in  an  orgy  of  reckless consumption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, we can congratulate ourselves on the unprecedented accomplishments of  modern  Sapiens  only  if  we  completely  ignore  the  fate  of  all  other  animals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much of the vaunted material wealth that shields us from disease and famine was accumulated at the expense of laboratory monkeys, dairy cows and conveyor-belt chickens. Over the last two centuries tens of billions of them have been subjected to a regime of industrial exploitation whose cruelty has no precedent in the annals of  planet  Earth.  If  we  accept  a  mere  tenth  of  what  animal-rights  activists  are claiming, then modern industrial agriculture might well be the greatest crime in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a>history.  When  evaluating  global  happiness,  it  is  wrong  to  count  the  happiness only  of  the  upper  classes,  of  Europeans  or  of  men.  Perhaps  it  is  also  wrong  to consider only the happiness of humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Counting Happiness</p>
<p class="calibre1">So  far  we  have  discussed  happiness  as  if  it  were  largely  a  product  of  material factors, such as health, diet and wealth. If people are richer and healthier, then they must also be happier. But is that really so obvious? Philosophers, priests and poets have brooded over the nature of happiness for millennia, and many have concluded that social, ethical and spiritual factors have as great an impact on our happiness  as  material  conditions.  Perhaps  people  in  modern  a uent  societies su er greatly from alienation and meaninglessness despite their prosperity. And perhaps  our  less  well-to-do  ancestors  found  much  contentment  in  community, religion and a bond with nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In recent decades, psychologists and biologists have taken up the challenge of studying  scienti cally  what  really  makes  people  happy.  Is  it  money,  family, genetics or perhaps virtue? The  rst step is to de ne what is to be measured. The generally  accepted  de nition  of  happiness  is  ‘subjective  well-being’.  Happiness, according  to  this  view,  is  something  I  feel  inside  myself,  a  sense  of  either immediate pleasure or long-term contentment with the way my life is going. If it’s something felt inside, how can it be measured from outside? Presumably, we can do so by asking people to tell us how they feel. So psychologists or biologists who want  to  assess  how  happy  people  feel  give  them  questionnaires  to  ll  out  and tally the results. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  typical  subjective  well-being  questionnaire  asks  interviewees  to  grade  on  a scale of zero to ten their agreement with statements such as ‘I feel pleased with the way I am’, ‘I feel that life is very rewarding’, ‘I am optimistic about the future’</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ‘Life is good’. The researcher then adds up all the answers and calculates the interviewee’s general level of subjective well-being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  questionnaires  are  used  in  order  to  correlate  happiness  with  various objective factors. One study might compare a thousand people who earn $100,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">a year with a thousand people who earn $50,000. If the study discovers that the rst group has an average subjective well-being level of 8.7, while the latter has an  average  of  only  7.3,  the  researcher  may  reasonably  conclude  that  there  is  a positive correlation between wealth and subjective well-being. To put it in simple English,  money  brings  happiness.  The  same  method  can  be  used  to  examine whether  people  living  in  democracies  are  happier  than  people  living  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p323"></a>dictatorships, and whether married people are happier than singles, divorcees or widowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  provides  a  grounding  for  historians,  who  can  examine  wealth,  political freedom and divorce rates in the past. If people are happier in democracies and married people are happier than divorcees, a historian has a basis for arguing that the democratisation process of the last few decades contributed to the happiness of humankind, whereas the growing rates of divorce indicate an opposite trend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This way of thinking is not  awless, but before pointing out some of the holes, it is worth considering the findings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One interesting conclusion is that money does indeed bring happiness. But only up to a point, and beyond that point it has little signi cance. For people stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder, more money means greater happiness. If you are an American single mother earning $12,000 a year cleaning houses and you suddenly win $500,000 in the lottery, you will probably experience a signi cant and  long-term  surge  in  your  subjective  well-being.  You’ll  be  able  to  feed  and clothe  your  children  without  sinking  further  into  debt.  However,  if  you’re  a  top executive earning $250,000 a year and you win $1 million in the lottery, or your company board suddenly decides to double your salary, your surge is likely to last only  a  few  weeks.  According  to  the  empirical  ndings,  it’s  almost  certainly  not going to make a big di erence to the way you feel over the long run. You’ll buy a snazzier  car,  move  into  a  palatial  home,  get  used  to  drinking  Chateau  Pétrus instead of California Cabernet, but it’ll soon all seem routine and unexceptional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another interesting  nding is that illness decreases happiness in the short term, but  is  a  source  of  long-term  distress  only  if  a  person’s  condition  is  constantly deteriorating or if the disease involves ongoing and debilitating pain. People who are  diagnosed  with  chronic  illness  such  as  diabetes  are  usually  depressed  for  a while, but if the illness does not get worse they adjust to their new condition and rate their happiness as highly as healthy people do. Imagine that Lucy and Luke are middle-class twins, who agree to take part in a subjective well-being study. On the way back from the psychology laboratory, Lucy’s car is hit by a bus, leaving Lucy  with  a  number  of  broken  bones  and  a  permanently  lame  leg.  Just  as  the rescue crew is cutting her out of the wreckage, the phone rings and Luke shouts that  he  has  won  the  lottery’s  $10,000,000  jackpot.  Two  years  later  she’ll  be limping and he’ll be a lot richer, but when the psychologist comes around for a follow-up  study,  they  are  both  likely  to  give  the  same  answers  they  did  on  the morning of that fateful day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  health.  People  with  strong  families  who  live  in  tight-knit  and  supportive communities  are  signi cantly  happier  than  people  whose  families  are dysfunctional  and  who  have  never  found  (or  never  sought)  a  community  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>part  of.  Marriage  is  particularly  important.  Repeated  studies  have  found  that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being,  and  between  bad  marriages  and  misery.  This  holds  true  irrespective  of economic  or  even  physical  conditions.  An  impecunious  invalid  surrounded  by  a loving spouse, a devoted family and a warm community may well feel better than an alienated billionaire, provided that the invalid’s poverty is not too severe and that his illness is not degenerative or painful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This raises the possibility that the immense improvement in material conditions over  the  last  two  centuries  was  o set  by  the  collapse  of  the  family  and  the community.  If  so,  the  average  person  might  well  be  no  happier  today  than  in 1800. Even the freedom we value so highly may be working against us. We can choose our spouses, friends and neighbours, but they can choose to leave us. With the individual wielding unprecedented power to decide her own path in life, we nd it ever harder to make commitments. We thus live in an increasingly lonely world of unravelling communities and families. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the most important  nding of all is that happiness does not really depend on  objective  conditions  of  either  wealth,  health  or  even  community.  Rather,  it depends  on  the  correlation  between  objective  conditions  and  subjective expectations. If you want a bullock-cart and get a bullock-cart, you are content. If you want a brand-new Ferrari and get only a second-hand Fiat you feel deprived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  why  winning  the  lottery  has,  over  time,  the  same  impact  on  people’s happiness  as  a  debilitating  car  accident.  When  things  improve, expectations balloon,  and  consequently  even  dramatic  improvements  in  objective  conditions can  leave  us  dissatis ed.  When  things  deteriorate,  expectations  shrink,  and consequently even a severe illness might leave you pretty much as happy as you were before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  might  say  that  we  didn’t  need  a  bunch  of  psychologists  and  their questionnaires  to  discover  this.  Prophets,  poets  and  philosophers  realised thousands of years ago that being satis ed with what you already have is far more important  than  getting  more  of  what  you  want.  Still,  it’s  nice  when  modern research – bolstered by lots of numbers and charts – reaches the same conclusions the ancients did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  crucial  importance  of  human  expectations  has  far-reaching  implications  for understanding the history of happiness. If happiness depended only on objective conditions  such  as  wealth,  health  and  social  relations,  it  would  have  been relatively easy to investigate its history. The  nding that it depends on subjective expectations makes the task of historians far harder. We moderns have an arsenal of tranquillisers and painkillers at our disposal, but our expectations of ease and pleasure, and our intolerance of inconvenience and discomfort, have increased to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a>such an extent that we may well su er from pain more than our ancestors ever did.It’s hard to accept this line of thinking. The problem is a fallacy of reasoning embedded deep in our psyches. When we try to guess or imagine how happy other people are now, or how people in the past were, we inevitably imagine ourselves in their shoes. But that won’t work because it pastes our expectations on to the material conditions of others. In modern a uent societies it is customary to take a shower  and  change  your  clothes  every  day.  Medieval  peasants  went  without washing  for  months  on  end,  and  hardly  ever  changed  their  clothes.  The  very thought of living like that,  lthy and reeking to the bone, is abhorrent to us. Yet medieval peasants seem not to have minded. They were used to the feel and smell of  a  long-unlaundered  shirt.  It’s  not  that  they  wanted  a  change  of  clothes  but couldn’t get it – they had what they wanted. So, at least as far as clothing goes, they were content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s not so surprising, when you think of it. After all, our chimpanzee cousins seldom wash and never change their clothes. Nor are we disgusted by the fact that our pet dogs and cats don’t shower or change their coats daily. We pat, hug and kiss them all the same. Small children in a uent societies often dislike showering, and  it  takes  them  years  of  education  and  parental  discipline  to  adopt  this supposedly attractive custom. It is all a matter of expectations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  happiness  is  determined  by  expectations,  then  two  pillars  of  our  society  –</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass  media  and  the  advertising  industry  –  may  unwittingly  be  depleting  the globe’s  reservoirs  of  contentment.  If  you  were  an  eighteen-year-old  youth  in  a small village 5,000 years ago you’d probably think you were good-looking because there were only  fty other men in your village and most of them were either old, scarred and wrinkled, or still little kids. But if you are a teenager today you are a lot more likely to feel inadequate. Even if the other guys at school are an ugly lot, you don’t measure yourself against them but against the movie stars, athletes and supermodels you see all day on television, Facebook and giant billboards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So maybe Third World discontent is fomented not merely by poverty, disease, corruption  and  political  oppression  but  also  by  mere  exposure  to  First  World standards. The average Egyptian was far less likely to die from starvation, plague or violence under Hosni Mubarak than under Ramses II or Cleopatra. Never had the material condition of most Egyptians been so good. You’d think they would have been dancing in the streets in 2011, thanking Allah for their good fortune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead  they  rose  up  furiously  to  overthrow  Mubarak.  They  weren’t  comparing themselves  to  their  ancestors  under  the  pharaohs,  but  rather  to  their contemporaries in Obama’s America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  that’s  the  case,  even  immortality  might  lead  to  discontent.  Suppose  science comes  up  with  cures  for  all  diseases,  e ective  anti-ageing  therapies  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">regenerative treatments that keep people inde nitely young. In all likelihood, the immediate result will be an unprecedented epidemic of anger and anxiety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those unable to a ord the new miracle treatments – the vast majority of people</p>
<p class="calibre1">– will be beside themselves with rage. Throughout history, the poor and oppressed comforted themselves with the thought that at least death is even-handed – that the  rich  and  powerful  will  also  die.  The  poor  will  not  be  comfortable  with  the thought that they have to die, while the rich will remain young and beautiful for ever. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a>Chemical Happiness</p>
<p class="calibre1">Social  scientists  distribute  subjective  well-being  questionnaires  and  correlate  the results with socio-economic factors such as wealth and political freedom. Biologists use  the  same  questionnaires,  but  correlate  the  answers  people  give  them  with biochemical and genetic factors. Their findings are shocking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Biologists hold that our mental and emotional world is governed by biochemical mechanisms shaped by millions of years of evolution. Like all other mental states, our subjective well-being is not determined by external parameters such as salary, social relations or political rights. Rather, it is determined by a complex system of nerves, neurons, synapses and various biochemical substances such as serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody is ever made happy by winning the lottery, buying a house, getting a promotion  or  even  nding  true  love.  People  are  made  happy  by  one  thing  and one thing only – pleasant sensations in their bodies. A person who just won the lottery or found new love and jumps from joy is not really reacting to the money or  the  lover.  She  is  reacting  to  various  hormones  coursing  through  her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signals  ashing between di erent parts of her brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately  for  all  hopes  of  creating  heaven  on  earth,  our  internal biochemical system seems to be programmed to keep happiness levels relatively constant.  There’s  no  natural  selection  for  happiness  as  such  –  a  happy  hermit’s genetic line will go extinct as the genes of a pair of anxious parents get carried on to the next generation. Happiness and misery play a role in evolution only to the extent that they encourage or discourage survival and reproduction. Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that evolution has moulded us to be neither too miserable nor too happy. It enables us to enjoy a momentary rush of pleasant sensations, but these never last for ever. Sooner or later they subside and give place to unpleasant sensations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  evolution  provided  pleasant  feelings  as  rewards  to  males  who spread their genes by having sex with fertile females. If sex were not accompanied by such pleasure, few males would bother. At the same time, evolution made sure that these pleasant feelings quickly subsided. If orgasms were to last for ever, the very happy males would die of hunger for lack of interest in food, and would not take the trouble to look for additional fertile females. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some scholars compare human biochemistry to an air-conditioning system that keeps  the  temperature  constant,  come  heatwave  or  snowstorm.  Events  might momentarily  change  the temperature,  but  the  air-conditioning  system  always returns the temperature to the same set point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some air-conditioning systems are set at twenty- ve degrees Celsius. Others are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a>set  at  twenty  degrees.  Human  happiness  conditioning  systems  also  di er  from person  to  person.  On  a  scale  from  one  to  ten,  some  people  are  born  with  a cheerful  biochemical  system  that  allows  their  mood  to  swing  between  levels  six and ten, stabilising with time at eight. Such a person is quite happy even if she lives in an alienating big city, loses all her money in a stock-exchange crash and is diagnosed with diabetes. Other people are cursed with a gloomy biochemistry that swings between three and seven and stabilises at  ve. Such an unhappy person remains depressed even if she enjoys the support of a tight-knit community, wins millions in the lottery and is as healthy as an Olympic athlete. Indeed, even if our gloomy friend wins $50,000,000 in the morning, discovers the cure for both AIDS</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  cancer  by  noon,  makes  peace  between  Israelis  and  Palestinians  that afternoon,  and  then  in  the  evening  reunites  with  her  long-lost  child  who disappeared  years  ago  –  she  would  still  be  incapable  of  experiencing  anything beyond level seven happiness. Her brain is simply not built for exhilaration, come what may. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think  for  a  moment  of  your  family  and  friends.  You  know  some  people  who remain relatively joyful, no matter what befalls them. And then there are those who are always disgruntled, no matter what gifts the world lays at their feet. We tend  to  believe  that  if  we  could  just  change  our  workplace,  get  married,  nish writing that novel, buy a new car or repay the mortgage, we would be on top of the  world.  Yet  when  we  get  what  we  desire  we  don’t  seem  to  be  any  happier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buying cars and writing novels do not change our biochemistry. They can startle it for a fleeting moment, but it is soon back to its set point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How can this be squared with the above-mentioned psychological and sociological ndings that, for example, married people are happier on average than singles? </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  these  ndings  are  correlations  –  the  direction  of  causation  may  be  the opposite of what some researchers have assumed. It is true that married people are happier than singles and divorcees, but that does not necessarily mean that marriage produces happiness. It could be that happiness causes marriage. Or more correctly,  that  serotonin,  dopamine  and  oxytocin  bring  about  and  maintain  a marriage. People who are born with a cheerful biochemistry are generally happy and content. Such people are more attractive spouses, and consequently they have a greater chance of getting married. They are also less likely to divorce, because it is far easier to live with a happy and content spouse than with a depressed and dissatis ed  one.  Consequently,  it’s  true  that  married  people  are  happier  on average  than  singles,  but  a  single  woman  prone  to  gloom  because  of  her biochemistry would not necessarily become happier if she were to hook up with a husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition,  most  biologists  are  not  fanatics.  They  maintain  that  happiness  is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p329"></a>determined  <i class="calibre4">mainly</i>  by  biochemistry,  but  they  agree  that  psychological  and sociological factors also have their place. Our mental air-conditioning system has some freedom of movement within predetermined borders. It is almost impossible to  exceed  the  upper  and  lower  emotional  boundaries,  but  marriage  and  divorce can have an impact in the area between the two. Somebody born with an average of  level  ve  happiness  would  never  dance  wildly  in  the  streets.  But  a  good marriage should enable her to enjoy level seven from time to time, and to avoid the despondency of level three. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history turns out to be of  minor  importance,  since  most  historical  events  have  had  no  impact  on  our biochemistry. History can change the external stimuli that cause serotonin to be secreted, yet it does not change the resulting serotonin levels, and hence it cannot make people happier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compare a medieval French peasant to a modern Parisian banker. The peasant</p>
<p class="calibre1">lived in an unheated mud hut overlooking the local pigsty, while the banker goes home to a splendid penthouse with all the latest technological gadgets and a view to  the  Champs-Elysées.  Intuitively,  we  would  expect  the  banker  to  be  much happier  than  the  peasant.  However,  mud  huts,  penthouses  and  the  Champs-Elysées  don’t  really  determine  our  mood.  Serotonin  does.  When  the  medieval peasant  completed  the  construction  of  his  mud  hut,  his  brain  neurons  secreted serotonin,  bringing  it  up  to  level  X.  When  in  2014  the  banker  made  the  last payment on his wonderful penthouse, brain neurons secreted a similar amount of serotonin, bringing it up to a similar level X. It makes no di erence to the brain that the penthouse is far more comfortable than the mud hut. The only thing that matters  is  that  at  present  the  level  of  serotonin  is  X.  Consequently  the  banker would  not  be  one  iota  happier  than  his  great-great-great-grandfather,  the  poor medieval peasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is true not only of private lives, but also of great collective events. Take, for example, the French Revolution. The revolutionaries were busy: they executed the king, gave lands to the peasants, declared the rights of man, abolished noble privileges and waged war against the whole of Europe. Yet none of that changed French biochemistry. Consequently, despite all the political, social, ideological and economic  upheavals  brought  about  by  the  revolution,  its  impact  on  French happiness was small. Those who won a cheerful biochemistry in the genetic lottery were  just  as  happy  before  the  revolution  as  after.  Those  with  a  gloomy biochemistry  complained  about  Robespierre  and  Napoleon  with  the  same bitterness  with  which  they  earlier  complained  about  Louis  XVI  and  Marie Antoinette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  so,  what  good  was  the  French  Revolution?  If  people  did  not  become  any happier, then what was the point of all that chaos, fear, blood and war? Biologists</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a>would never have stormed the Bastille. People think that this political revolution or  that  social  reform  will  make  them  happy,  but  their  biochemistry  tricks  them time and again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is only one historical development that has real significance. Today, when we  nally realise that the keys to happiness are in the hands of our biochemical system, we can stop wasting our time on politics and social reforms, putsches and ideologies,  and  focus  instead  on  the  only  thing  that  can  make  us  truly  happy: manipulating  our  biochemistry.  If  we  invest  billions  in  understanding  our  brain chemistry  and  developing  appropriate  treatments,  we  can  make  people  far happier than ever before, without any need of revolutions. Prozac, for example, does not change regimes, but by raising serotonin levels it lifts people out of their depression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing  captures  the  biological  argument  better  than  the  famous  New  Age slogan: ‘Happiness Begins Within.’ Money, social status, plastic surgery, beautiful houses,  powerful  positions  –  none  of  these will  bring  you  happiness.  Lasting happiness comes only from serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. <a href="#p363">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel  <i class="calibre4">Brave New World</i>, published in 1932 at the height  of  the  Great  Depression,  happiness  is  the  supreme  value  and  psychiatric drugs  replace  the  police  and  the  ballot  as  the  foundation  of  politics.  Each  day, each person takes a dose of ‘soma’, a synthetic drug which makes people happy without harming their productivity and e ciency. The World State that governs the  entire  globe  is  never  threatened  by  wars,  revolutions,  strikes  or demonstrations,  because  all  people  are  supremely  content  with  their  current conditions,  whatever  they  may  be.  Huxley’s  vision  of  the  future  is  far  more troubling  than  George  Orwell’s  <i class="calibre4">Nineteen  Eighty-Four</i>.  Huxley’s  world  seems monstrous to most readers, but it is hard to explain why. Everybody is happy all the time – what could be wrong with that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Meaning of Life</p>
<p class="calibre1">Huxley’s disconcerting world is based on the biological assumption that happiness equals pleasure. To be happy is no more and no less than experiencing pleasant bodily sensations. Since our biochemistry limits the volume and duration of these sensations, the only way to make people experience a high level of happiness over an extended period of time is to manipulate their biochemical system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  that  de nition  of  happiness  is  contested  by  some  scholars.  In  a  famous study, Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, asked people to recount a typical work day, going through it episode by episode and evaluating</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a>how much they enjoyed or disliked each moment. He discovered what seems to be a paradox in most people’s view of their lives. Take the work involved in raising a child.  Kahneman  found  that  when  counting  moments  of  joy  and  moments  of drudgery, bringing up a child turns out to be a rather unpleasant a air. It consists largely of changing nappies, washing dishes and dealing with temper tantrums, which  nobody  likes  to  do.  Yet  most  parents  declare  that  their  children  are  their chief source of happiness. Does it mean that people don’t really know what’s good for them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s one option. Another is that the findings demonstrate that happiness is not the  surplus  of  pleasant  over  unpleasant  moments.  Rather,  happiness  consists  in seeing  one’s  life  in  its  entirety  as  meaningful  and  worthwhile.  There  is  an important cognitive and ethical component to happiness. Our values make all the di erence to whether we see ourselves as ‘miserable slaves to a baby dictator’ or as ‘lovingly nurturing a new life’. <a href="#p363">2 </a>As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though people in all cultures and eras have felt the same type of pleasures and pains,  the  meaning  they  have  ascribed  to  their  experiences  has  probably  varied widely. If so, the history of happiness might have been far more turbulent than biologists  imagine.  It’s  a  conclusion  that  does  not  necessarily  favour  modernity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assessing life minute by minute, medieval people certainly had it rough. However, if  they  believed  the  promise  of  everlasting  bliss  in  the  afterlife,  they  may  well have  viewed  their  lives  as  far  more  meaningful  and  worthwhile  than  modern secular  people,  who  in  the  long  term  can  expect  nothing  but  complete  and meaningless oblivion. Asked ‘Are you satis ed with your life as a whole?’, people in  the  Middle  Ages  might  have  scored  quite  highly  in  a  subjective  well-being questionnaire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  our  medieval  ancestors  were  happy  because  they  found  meaning  to  life  in collective  delusions  about  the  afterlife?  Yes.  As  long  as  nobody  punctured  their fantasies,  why  shouldn’t  they?  As  far  as  we  can  tell,  from  a  purely  scienti c viewpoint,  human  life  has  absolutely  no  meaning.  Humans  are  the  outcome  of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. Our actions are not  part  of  some  divine  cosmic  plan,  and  if  planet  Earth  were  to  blow  up tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its business as usual. As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence  <i class="calibre4">any</i> meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion. The other-worldly meanings medieval people found in their lives were no more deluded than the  modern  humanist,  nationalist  and  capitalist  meanings  modern  people  nd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  scientist  who  says  her  life  is  meaningful  because  she  increases  the  store  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a>human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he ghts  to  defend  his  homeland,  and  the  entrepreneur  who  nds  meaning  in building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So perhaps happiness is synchronising one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions. As long as my personal narrative is in line with the  narratives  of  the  people  around  me,  I  can  convince  myself  that  my  life  is meaningful, and find happiness in that conviction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  quite  a  depressing  conclusion.  Does  happiness  really  depend  on  self-delusion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Know Thyself</p>
<p class="calibre1">If happiness is based on feeling pleasant sensations, then in order to be happier we need to re-engineer our biochemical system. If happiness is based on feeling that life is meaningful, then in order to be happier we need to delude ourselves more effectively. Is there a third alternative? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  the  above  views  share  the  assumption  that  happiness  is  some  sort  of subjective  feeling  (of  either  pleasure  or  meaning),  and  that  in  order  to  judge people’s happiness, all we need to do is ask them how they feel. To many of us, that  seems  logical  because  the  dominant  religion  of  our  age  is  liberalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liberalism sancti es the subjective feelings of individuals. It views these feelings as  the  supreme  source  of  authority.  What  is  good  and  what  is  bad,  what  is beautiful and what is ugly, what ought to be and what ought not to be, are all determined by what each one of us feels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liberal politics is based on the idea that the voters know best, and there is no need for Big Brother to tell us what is good for us. Liberal economics is based on the idea that the customer is always right. Liberal art declares that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Students in liberal schools and universities are taught to think for  themselves.  Commercials  urge  us  to  ‘Just  do  it!’  Action  lms,  stage  dramas, soap operas, novels and catchy pop songs indoctrinate us constantly: ‘Be true to yourself’,  ‘Listen  to  yourself’,  ‘Follow  your  heart’.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau  stated this view most classically: ‘What I feel to be good – is good. What I feel to be bad –</p>
<p class="calibre1">is bad.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">People who have been raised from infancy on a diet of such slogans are prone to  believe  that  happiness  is  a  subjective  feeling  and  that  each  individual  best knows whether she is happy or miserable. Yet this view is unique to liberalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a>Most  religions  and  ideologies  throughout  history  stated  that  there  are  objective yardsticks for goodness and beauty, and for how things ought to be. They were suspicious of the feelings and preferences of the ordinary person. At the entrance of the temple of Apollo at Delphi, pilgrims were greeted by the inscription: ‘Know thyself!’ The implication was that the average person is ignorant of his true self, and  is  therefore  likely  to  be  ignorant  of  true  happiness.  Freud  would  probably concur. <a href="#p336">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">And  so  would  Christian  theologians.  St  Paul  and  St  Augustine  knew  perfectly well that if you asked people about it, most of them would prefer to have sex than pray  to  God.  Does  that  prove  that  having  sex  is  the  key  to  happiness?  Not according  to  Paul  and  Augustine.  It  proves  only  that  humankind  is  sinful  by nature, and that people are easily seduced by Satan. From a Christian viewpoint, the  vast  majority  of  people  are  in  more  or  less  the  same  situation  as  heroin addicts. Imagine that a psychologist embarks on a study of happiness among drug users. He polls them and  nds that they declare, every single one of them, that they are only happy when they shoot up. Would the psychologist publish a paper declaring that heroin is the key to happiness? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The idea that feelings are not to be trusted is not restricted to Christianity. At least when it comes to the value of feelings, even Darwin and Dawkins might  nd common  ground  with  St  Paul  and  St  Augustine.  According  to  the  sel sh  gene theory, natural selection makes people, like other organisms, choose what is good for the reproduction of their genes, even if it is bad for them as individuals. Most males  spend  their  lives  toiling,  worrying,  competing  and  ghting,  instead  of enjoying  peaceful  bliss,  because  their  DNA manipulates  them  for  its  own  sel sh aims. Like Satan, DNA uses  eeting pleasures to tempt people and place them in its power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  religions  and  philosophies  have  consequently  taken  a  very  di erent approach to happiness than liberalism does. <a href="#p363">3</a> The Buddhist position is particularly interesting.  Buddhism  has  assigned  the  question  of  happiness  more  importance than  perhaps  any  other  human  creed.  For  2,500  years,  Buddhists  have systematically studied the essence and causes of happiness, which is why there is a growing  interest  among  the  scienti c  community  both  in  their  philosophy  and their meditation practices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buddhism  shares  the  basic  insight  of  the  biological  approach  to  happiness, namely that happiness results from processes occurring within one’s body, and not from  events  in  the  outside  world.  However,  starting  from  the  same  insight, Buddhism reaches very different conclusions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Buddhism, most people identify happiness with pleasant feelings, while identifying su ering with unpleasant feelings. People consequently ascribe immense  importance  to  what  they  feel,  craving  to  experience  more  and  more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a>pleasures,  while  avoiding  pain.  Whatever  we  do  throughout  our  lives,  whether scratching our leg,  dgeting slightly in the chair, or  ghting world wars, we are just trying to get pleasant feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  problem,  according  to  Buddhism,  is  that  our  feelings  are  no  more  than eeting vibrations, changing every moment, like the ocean waves. If  ve minutes ago I felt joyful and purposeful, now these feelings are gone, and I might well feel sad and dejected. So if I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase  them,  while  driving  away  the  unpleasant  feelings.  Even  if  I  succeed,  I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is so important about obtaining such ephemeral prizes? Why struggle so hard to achieve something that disappears almost as soon as it arises? According to Buddhism, the root of su ering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even  of  meaninglessness.  Rather,  the  real  root  of  su ering  is  this  never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state  of  tension,  restlessness  and  dissatisfaction.  Due  to  this  pursuit, the  mind  is never  satis ed.  Even  when  experiencing  pleasure,  it  is  not  content,  because  it fears  this  feeling  might  soon  disappear,  and  craves  that  this  feeling  should  stay and intensify. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  are  liberated  from  su ering  not  when  they  experience  this  or  that eeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their  feelings,  and  stop  craving  them.  This  is  the  aim  of  Buddhist  meditation practices. In meditation, you are supposed to closely observe your mind and body, witness  the  ceaseless  arising  and  passing  of  all  your  feelings,  and  realise  how pointless  it  is  to  pursue  them.  When  the  pursuit  stops,  the  mind  becomes  very relaxed, clear and satis ed. All kinds of feelings go on arising and passing – joy, anger, boredom, lust – but once you stop craving particular feelings, you can just accept  them  for  what  they  are.  You  live  in  the  present  moment  instead  of fantasising about what might have been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  resulting  serenity  is  so  profound  that  those  who  spend  their  lives  in  the frenzied  pursuit  of  pleasant  feelings  can  hardly  imagine  it.  It  is  like  a  man standing for decades on the seashore, embracing certain ‘good’ waves and trying to  prevent  them  from  disintegrating,  while  simultaneously  pushing  back  ‘bad’</p>
<p class="calibre1">waves to prevent them from getting near him. Day in, day out, the man stands on the  beach,  driving  himself  crazy  with  this  fruitless  exercise.  Eventually,  he  sits down on the sand and just allows the waves to come and go as they please. How peaceful! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  idea  is  so  alien  to  modern  liberal  culture  that  when  Western  New  Age movements encountered Buddhist insights, they translated them into liberal terms, thereby turning them on their head. New Age cults frequently argue: ‘Happiness</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a>does not depend on external conditions. It depends only on what we feel inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People should stop pursuing external achievements such as wealth and status, and connect instead with their inner feelings.’ Or more succinctly, ‘Happiness Begins Within.’  This  is  exactly  what  biologists  argue,  but  more  or  less  the  opposite  of what Buddha said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent  of  external  conditions.  Yet  his  more  important  and  far  more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, the more signi cance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we su er. Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To sum up, subjective well-being questionnaires identify our well-being with our subjective  feelings,  and  identify  the  pursuit  of  happiness  with  the  pursuit  of particular  emotional  states.  In  contrast,  for  many  traditional  philosophies  and religions,  such  as  Buddhism,  the  key  to  happiness  is  to  know  the  truth  about yourself  –  to  understand  who,  or  what,  you  really  are.  Most  people  wrongly identify themselves with their feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes. When they feel anger, they think, ‘I am angry. This is my anger.’ They consequently spend their life avoiding some kinds of feelings and pursuing others. They never realise that they are not their feelings, and that the relentless pursuit of particular feelings just traps them in misery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If this is so, then our entire understanding of the history of happiness might be misguided. Maybe it isn’t so important whether people’s expectations are ful lled and  whether  they  enjoy  pleasant  feelings.  The  main  question  is  whether  people know  the  truth  about  themselves.  What  evidence  do  we  have  that  people  today understand this truth any better than ancient foragers or medieval peasants? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scholars began to study the history of happiness only a few years ago, and we are  still  formulating  initial  hypotheses  and  searching  for  appropriate  research methods.  It’s  much  too  early  to  adopt  rigid  conclusions  and  end  a  debate  that’s hardly  yet  begun.  What  is  important  is  to  get  to  know  as  many  di erent approaches as possible and to ask the right questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most history books focus on the ideas of great thinkers, the bravery of warriors, the charity of saints and the creativity of artists. They have much to tell about the weaving and unravelling of social structures, about the rise and fall of empires, about the discovery and spread of technologies. Yet they say nothing about how all this in uenced the happiness and su ering of individuals. This is the biggest lacuna in our understanding of history. We had better start filling it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The End of  <i class="calibre4">Homo Sapiens</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">THIS BOOK BEGAN BY PRESENTING HISTORY as the next stage in the continuum</p>
<p class="calibre1">of physics to chemistry to biology. Sapiens are subject to the same physical forces, chemical  reactions  and  natural-selection  processes  that  govern  all  living  beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Natural  selection  may  have  provided  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  with  a  much  larger  playing eld  than  it  has  given  to  any  other  organism,  but  the  eld  has  still  had  its boundaries.  The  implication  has  been  that,  no  matter  what  their  e orts  and achievements,  Sapiens  are  incapable  of  breaking  free  of  their  biologically determined limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at the dawn of the twenty- rst century, this is no longer true:  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> is  transcending  those  limits.  It  is  now  beginning  to  break  the  laws  of  natural selection, replacing them with the laws of intelligent design. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For close to 4 billion years, every single organism on the planet evolved subject to  natural  selection.  Not  even  one  was  designed  by  an  intelligent  creator.  The gira e,  for  example,  got  its  long  neck  thanks  to  competition  between  archaic gira es rather than to the whims of a super-intelligent being. Proto-gira es who had  longer  necks  had  access  to  more  food  and  consequently  produced  more o spring  than  did  those  with  shorter  necks.  Nobody,  certainly  not  the  gira es, said,  ‘A  long  neck  would  enable  gira es  to  munch  leaves  o   the  treetops.  Let’s extend  it.’  The  beauty  of  Darwin’s  theory  is  that  it  does  not  need  to  assume  an intelligent designer to explain how giraffes ended up with long necks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For billions of years, intelligent design was not even an option, because there was no intelligence which could design things. Microorganisms, which until quite recently  were  the  only  living  things  around,  are  capable  of  amazing  feats.  A microorganism  belonging  to  one  species  can  incorporate  genetic  codes  from  a completely di erent species into its cell and thereby gain new capabilities, such as resistance  to  antibiotics.  Yet,  as  best  we  know,  microorganisms  have  no consciousness, no aims in life, and no ability to plan ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  some  stage  organisms  such  as  gira es,  dolphins,  chimpanzees  and Neanderthals evolved consciousness and the ability to plan ahead. But even if a Neanderthal  fantasised  about  fowls  so  fat  and  slow-moving  that  he  could  just scoop them up whenever he was hungry, he had no way of turning that fantasy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a>into reality. He had to hunt the birds that had been naturally selected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst crack in the old regime appeared about 10,000 years ago, during the Agricultural  Revolution.  Sapiens  who  dreamed  of  fat,  slow-moving  chickens discovered that if they mated the fattest hen with the slowest cock, some of their o spring  would  be  both  fat  and  slow.  If  you  mated  those  o spring  with  each other,  you  could  produce  a  line  of  fat,  slow  birds.  It  was  a  race  of  chickens unknown  to  nature,  produced  by  the  intelligent  design  not  of  a  god  but  of  a human. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, compared to an all-powerful deity,  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> had limited design skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sapiens could use selective breeding to detour around and accelerate the natural-selection processes that normally a ected chickens, but they could not introduce completely  new  characteristics  that  were  absent  from  the  genetic  pool  of  wild chickens.  In  a  way,  the  relationship  between  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  and  chickens  was similar to many other symbiotic relationships that have so often arisen on their own  in  nature.  Sapiens  exerted  peculiar  selective  pressures  on  chickens  that caused the fat and slow ones to proliferate, just as pollinating bees select  owers, causing the bright colourful ones to proliferate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, the 4-billion-year-old regime of natural selection is facing a completely di erent  challenge.  In  laboratories  throughout  the  world,  scientists  are engineering living beings. They break the laws of natural selection with impunity, unbridled even by an organisms original characteristics. Eduardo Kac, a Brazilian bio-artist, decided in 2000 to create a new work of art: a  uorescent green rabbit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kac contacted  a  French  laboratory  and  o ered  it  a  fee  to  engineer  a  radiant bunny according to his speci cations. The French scientists took a run-of-the-mill white rabbit embryo, implanted in its DNA a gene taken from a green  uorescent jelly sh,  and  <i class="calibre4">voilà</i>!  One  green  uorescent  rabbit  for  <i class="calibre4">le monsieur</i>.  Kac  named  the rabbit Alba. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  impossible  to  explain  the  existence  of  Alba  through  the  laws  of  natural selection. She is the product of intelligent design. She is also a harbinger of things to  come.  If  the  potential  Alba  signi es  is  realised  in  full  –  and  if  humankind doesn’t annihilate itself meanwhile – the Scienti c Revolution might prove itself far  greater  than  a  mere  historical  revolution.  It  may  turn  out  to  be  the  most important  <i class="calibre4">biological</i>  revolution  since  the  appearance  of  life  on  earth.  After  4</p>
<p class="calibre1">billion years of natural selection, Alba stands at the dawn of a new cosmic era, in which life will be ruled by intelligent design. If this happens, the whole of human history  up  to  that  point  might,  with  hindsight,  be  reinterpreted  as  a  process  of experimentation and apprenticeship that revolutionised the game of life. Such a process should be understood from a cosmic perspective of billions of years, rather than from a human perspective of millennia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Biologists  the  world  over  are  locked  in  battle  with  the  intelligent-design</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a>movement,  which  opposes  the  teaching  of  Darwinian  evolution  in  schools  and claims that biological complexity proves there must be a creator who thought out all biological details in advance. The biologists are right about the past, but the proponents of intelligent design might, ironically, be right about the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time of writing, the replacement of natural selection by intelligent design could  happen  in  any  of  three  ways:  through  biological  engineering,  cyborg engineering (cyborgs are beings that combine organic with non-organic parts) or the engineering of inorganic life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of Mice and Men</p>
<p class="calibre1">Biological  engineering  is  deliberate  human  intervention  on  the  biological  level (e.g.  implanting  a  gene)  aimed  at  modifying  an  organisms  shape,  capabilities, needs or desires, in order to realize some preconceived cultural idea, such as the artistic predilections of Eduardo Kac. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  nothing  new  about  biological  engineering,  per  se.  People  have  been using  it  for  millennia  in  order  to  reshape  themselves  and  other  organisms.  A simple  example  is  castration.  Humans  have  been  castrating  bulls  for  perhaps 10,000 years in order to create oxen. Oxen are less aggressive, and are thus easier to train to pull ploughs. Humans also castrated their own young males to create soprano singers with enchanting voices and eunuchs who could safely be entrusted with overseeing the sultans harem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But recent advances in our understanding of how organisms work, down to the cellular and nuclear levels, have opened up previously unimaginable possibilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  instance,  we  can  today  not  merely  castrate  a  man,  but  also  change  his  sex through  surgical  and  hormonal  treatments.  But  that’s  not  all.  Consider  the surprise,  disgust  and  consternation  that  ensued  when,  in  1996,  the  following photograph appeared in newspapers and on television:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a><img src="index-340_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p368"><b class="calibre3">46. </b></a><b class="calibre3">A mouse on whose back scientists grew an ‘ear’ made of cattle cartilage cells. It is an eerie echo of</b> <b class="calibre3">the lion-man statue from the Stadel Cave. Thirty thousand years ago, humans were already fantasising</b> <b class="calibre3">about combining different species. Today, they can actually produce such chimeras</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,  Photoshop  was  not  involved.  It’s  an  untouched  photo  of  a  real  mouse  on whose back scientists implanted cattle cartilage cells. The scientists were able to control the growth of the new tissue, shaping it in this case into something that looks  like  a  human  ear.  The  process  may  soon  enable  scientists  to  manufacture artificial ears, which could then be implanted in humans. <a href="#p363">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  more  remarkable  wonders  can  be  performed  with  genetic  engineering, which is why it raises a host of ethical, political and ideological issues. And it’s not just  pious  monotheists  who  object  that  man  should  not  usurp  God’s  role.  Many con rmed atheists are no less shocked by the idea that scientists are stepping into nature’s shoes. Animal-rights activists decry the su ering caused to lab animals in genetic engineering experiments, and to the farmyard animals that are engineered in complete disregard of their needs and desires. Human-rights activists are afraid that genetic engineering might be used to create supermen who will make serfs of the  rest  of  us.  Jeremiahs  o er  apocalyptic  visions  of  bio-dictatorships  that  will clone  fearless  soldiers  and  obedient  workers.  The  prevailing  feeling  is  that  too many opportunities are opening too quickly and that our ability to modify genes is outpacing our capacity for making wise and far-sighted use of the skill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  result  is  that  we’re  at  present  using  only  a  fraction  of  the  potential  of genetic engineering. Most of the organisms now being engineered are those with the  weakest  political  lobbies  –  plants,  fungi,  bacteria  and  insects.  For  example, lines of E. coli, a bacterium that lives symbiotically in the human gut (and which makes headlines when it gets out of the gut and causes deadly infections), have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a>been  genetically  engineered  to  produce  biofuel. <a href="#p363">2  </a>E.  coli  and  several  species  of fungi have also been engineered to produce insulin, thereby lowering the cost of diabetes treatment. <a href="#p363">3 </a>A gene extracted from an Arctic  sh has been inserted into potatoes, making the plants more frost-resistant. <a href="#p363">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">A few mammals have also been subject to genetic engineering. Every year the dairy industry su ers billions of dollars in damages due to mastitis, a disease that strikes  dairy-cow  udders.  Scientists  are  currently  experimenting  with  genetically engineered cows whose milk contains lysostaphin, a biochemical that attacks the bacteria responsible for the disease. <a href="#p363">5</a> The pork industry, which has su ered from falling sales because consumers are wary of the unhealthy fats in ham and bacon, has  hopes  for  a  still-experimental  line  of  pigs  implanted  with  genetic  material from a worm. The new genes cause the pigs to turn bad omega 6 fatty acid into its healthy cousin, omega 3. <a href="#p363">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The next generation of genetic engineering will make pigs with good fat look like  child’s  play.  Geneticists  have  managed  not  merely  to  extend  sixfold  the average life expectancy of worms, but also to engineer genius mice that display much-improved  memory  and  learning  skills. <a href="#p363">7  </a>Voles  are  small,  stout  rodents resembling  mice,  and  most  varieties  of  voles  are  promiscuous.  But  there  is  one species in which boy and girl voles form lasting and monogamous relationships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneticists claim to have isolated the genes responsible for vole monogamy. If the addition of a gene can turn a vole Don Juan into a loyal and loving husband, are we far o  from being able to genetically engineer not only the individual abilities of rodents (and humans), but also their social structures? <a href="#p363">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Return of the Neanderthals</p>
<p class="calibre1">But geneticists do not only want to transform living lineages. They aim to revive extinct  creatures  as  well.  And  not  just  dinosaurs,  as  in  <i class="calibre4">Jurassic  Park</i>.  A  team  of Russian,  Japanese  and  Korean  scientists  has  recently  mapped  the  genome  of ancient  mammoths,  found  frozen  in  the  Siberian  ice.  They  now  plan  to  take  a fertilised egg-cell of a present-day elephant, replace the elephantine DNA with a reconstructed mammoth DNA, and implant the egg in the womb of an elephant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After about twenty-two months, they expect the  rst mammoth in 5,000 years to be born. <a href="#p364">9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">But  why  stop  at  mammoths?  Professor  George  Church  of  Harvard  University recently suggested that, with the completion of the Neanderthal Genome Project, we  can  now  implant  reconstructed  Neanderthal  DNA  into  a  Sapiens  ovum,  thus producing  the  rst  Neanderthal  child  in  30,000  years.  Church  claimed  that  he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a>could do the job for a paltry $30 million. Several women have already volunteered to serve as surrogate mothers<a href="#p364">.10</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">What  do  we  need  Neanderthals  for?  Some  argue  that  if  we  could  study  live Neanderthals,  we  could  answer  some  of  the  most  nagging  questions  about  the origins and uniqueness of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. By comparing a Neanderthal to a  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i>  brain,  and  mapping  out  where  their  structures  di er,  perhaps  we  could identify  what  biological  change  produced  consciousness  as  we  experience  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s  an  ethical  reason,  too  –  some  have  argued  that  if  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  was responsible for the extinction of the Neanderthals, it has a moral duty to resurrect them. And having some Neanderthals around might be useful. Lots of industrialists would be glad to pay one Neanderthal to do the menial work of two Sapiens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But why stop even at Neanderthals? Why not go back to God’s drawing board</p>
<p class="calibre1">and design a better Sapiens? The abilities, needs and desires of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> have a genetic basis, and the Sapiens genome is no more complex than that of voles and mice. (The mouse genome contains about 2.5 billion nucleobases, the Sapiens genome about 2.9 billion bases – meaning the latter is only 14 per cent larger.)<a href="#p364">11</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the medium range – perhaps in a few decades – genetic engineering and other forms of biological engineering might enable us to make far-reaching alterations not only to our physiology, immune system and life expectancy, but also to our intellectual  and  emotional  capacities.  If  genetic  engineering  can  create  genius mice,  why  not  genius  humans?  If  it  can  create  monogamous  voles,  why  not humans hard-wired to remain faithful to their partners? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Cognitive  Revolution  that  turned  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  from  an  insigni cant  ape into the master of the world did not require any noticeable change in physiology or even in the size and external shape of the Sapiens brain. It apparently involved no  more  than  a  few  small  changes  to  internal  brain  structure.  Perhaps  another small change would be enough to ignite a Second Cognitive Revolution, create a completely new type of consciousness, and transform  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> into something altogether different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True, we still don’t have the acumen to achieve this, but there seems to be no insurmountable technical barrier preventing us from producing superhumans. The main  obstacles  are  the  ethical  and  political  objections  that  have  slowed  down research  on  humans.  And  no  matter  how  convincing  the  ethical  arguments  may be, it is hard to see how they can hold back the next step for long, especially if what  is  at  stake  is  the  possibility  of  prolonging  human  life  inde nitely, conquering  incurable  diseases,  and  upgrading  our  cognitive  and  emotional abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  would  happen,  for  example,  if  we  developed  a  cure  for  Alzheimer’s disease that, as a side benefit, could dramatically improve the memories of healthy people? Would anyone be able to halt the relevant research? And when the cure is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>developed, could any law enforcement agency limit it to Alzheimer’s patients and prevent healthy people from using it to acquire super-memories? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s unclear whether bioengineering could really resurrect the Neanderthals, but it would very likely bring down the curtain on  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. Tinkering with our genes won’t necessarily kill us. But we might  ddle with  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> to such an extent that we would no longer be  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bionic Life</p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  another  new  technology  which  could  change  the  laws  of  life:  cyborg engineering. Cyborgs are beings which combine organic and inorganic parts, such as a human with bionic hands. In a sense, nearly all of us are bionic these days, since  our  natural  senses  and  functions  are  supplemented  by  devices  such  as eyeglasses, pacemakers, orthotics, and even computers and mobile phones (which relieve our brains of some of their data storage and processing burdens). We stand poised on the brink of becoming true cyborgs, of having inorganic features that are  inseparable  from  our  bodies,  features  that  modify  our  abilities,  desires, personalities and identities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA),  a  US  military research  agency,  is  developing  cyborgs  out  of  insects.  The  idea  is  to  implant electronic chips, detectors and processors in the body of a  y or cockroach, which will  enable  either  a  human  or  an  automatic  operator  to  control  the  insect’s movements remotely and to absorb and transmit information. Such a  y could be sitting  on  the  wall  at  enemy  headquarters,  eavesdrop  on  the  most  secret conversations, and if it isn’t caught  rst by a spider, could inform us exactly what the enemy is planning. <a href="#p364">12 </a>In 2006 the US Naval Undersea Warfare Center reported its intention to develop cyborg sharks, declaring, ‘NUWC is developing a  sh tag whose  goal  is  behaviour  control  of  host  animals  via  neural  implants.’  The developers  hope  to  identify  underwater  electromagnetic  elds  made  by submarines and mines, by exploiting the natural magnetic detecting capabilities of sharks, which are superior to those of any man-made detectors. <a href="#p364">13</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sapiens, too, are being turned into cyborgs. The newest generation of hearing aids are sometimes referred to as ‘bionic ears’. The device consists of an implant that absorbs sound through a microphone located in the outer part of the ear. The implant  lters  the  sounds,  identi es  human  voices,  and  translates  them  into electric signals that are sent directly to the central auditory nerve and from there to the brain. <a href="#p364">14</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Retina  Implant,  a  government-sponsored  German  company,  is  developing  a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a><img src="index-344_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">retinal prosthesis that may allow blind people to gain partial vision. It involves implanting  a  small  microchip  inside  the  patient’s  eye.  Photocells  absorb  light falling  on  the  eye  and  transform  it  into  electrical  energy,  which  stimulates  the intact nerve cells in the retina. The nervous impulses from these cells stimulate the brain,  where  they  are  translated  into  sight.  At  present  the  technology  allows patients  to  orientate  themselves  in  space,  identify  letters,  and  even  recognise faces. <a href="#p364">15</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesse Sullivan, an American electrician, lost both arms up to the shoulder in a 2001  accident.  Today  he  uses  two  bionic  arms,  courtesy  of  the  Rehabilitation Institute  of  Chicago.  The  special  feature  of  Jesse’s  new  arms  is  that  they  are operated  by  thought  alone.  Neural  signals  arriving  from  Jesse’s  brain  are translated  by  micro-computers  into  electrical  commands,  and  the  arms  move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Jesse wants to raise his arm, he does what any normal person unconsciously does – and the arm rises. These arms can perform a much more limited range of movements  than  organic  arms,  but  they  enable  Jesse  to  carry  out  simple  daily functions. A similar bionic arm has recently been out tted for Claudia Mitchell, an American soldier who lost her arm in a motorcycle accident. Scientists believe that we will soon have bionic arms that will not only move when willed to move, but will also be able to transmit signals back to the brain, thereby enabling amputees to regain even the sensation of touch! <a href="#p364">16</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p368"><b class="calibre3">47. </b></a><b class="calibre3">Jesse Sullivan and Claudia Mitchell holding hands. The amazing thing about their bionic arms is that</b> <b class="calibre3">they are operated by thought</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At present these bionic arms are a poor replacement for our organic originals, but they have the potential for unlimited development. Bionic arms, for example, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p345"></a>can  be  made  far  more  powerful  than  their  organic  kin,  making  even  a  boxing champion  feel  like  a  weakling.  Moreover,  bionic  arms  have  the  advantage  that they can be replaced every few years, or detached from the body and operated at a distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scientists at Duke University in North Carolina have recently demonstrated this with  rhesus  monkeys  whose  brains  have  been  implanted  with  electrodes.  The electrodes  gather  signals  from  the  brain  and  transmit  them  to  external  devices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The monkeys have been trained to control detached bionic arms and legs through thought alone. One monkey, named Aurora, learned to thought-control a detached bionic arm while simultaneously moving her two organic arms. Like some Hindu goddess,  Aurora  now  has  three  arms,  and  her  arms  can  be  located  in  di erent rooms – or even cities. She can sit in her North Carolina lab, scratch her back with one  hand,  scratch her  head  with  a  second  hand,  and  simultaneously  steal  a banana in New York (although the ability to eat a purloined fruit at a distance remains a dream). Another rhesus monkey, Idoya, won world fame in 2008 when she  thought-controlled  a  pair  of  bionic  legs  in  Kyoto,  Japan,  from  her  North Carolina chair. The legs were twenty times Idoya’s weight. <a href="#p364">17</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a person loses all or nearly all her ability to move any part of her body, while her cognitive abilities remain intact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patients su ering from the syndrome have up till now been able to communicate with  the  outside  world  only  through  small  eye  movements.  However,  a  few patients  have  had  brain-signal-gathering  electrodes  implanted  in  their  brains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">E orts are being made to translate such signals not merely into movements but also into words. If the experiments succeed, locked-in patients could  nally speak directly  with  the  outside  world,  and  we  might  eventually  be  able  to  use  the technology to read other peoples minds. <a href="#p364">18</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet of all the projects currently under development, the most revolutionary is the  attempt  to  devise  a  direct  two-way  brain-computer  interface  that  will  allow computers  to  read  the  electrical  signals  of  a  human  brain,  simultaneously transmitting signals that the brain can read in turn. What if such interfaces are used to directly link a brain to the Internet, or to directly link several brains to each  other,  thereby  creating  a  sort  of  Inter-brain-net?  What  might  happen  to human memory, human consciousness and human identity if the brain has direct access  to  a  collective  memory  bank?  In  such  a  situation,  one  cyborg  could,  for example, retrieve the memories of another – not hear about them, not read about them  in  an  autobiography,  not  imagine  them,  but  directly  remember  them  as  if they were his own. Or her own. What happens to concepts such as the self and gender  identity  when  minds  become  collective?  How  could  you  know  thyself  or follow  your  dream  if  the  dream  is  not  in  your  mind  but  in  some  collective reservoir of aspirations? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>Such  a  cyborg  would  no  longer  be  human,  or  even  organic.  It  would  be something  completely  di erent.  It  would  be  so  fundamentally  another  kind  of being  that  we  cannot  even  grasp  the  philosophical,  psychological  or  political implications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another Life</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  third  way  to  change  the  laws  of  life  is  to  engineer  completely  inorganic beings. The most obvious examples are computer programs and computer viruses that can undergo independent evolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  eld of genetic programming is today one of the most interesting spots in the computer science world. It tries to emulate the methods of genetic evolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  programmers  dream  of  creating  a  program  that  could  learn  and  evolve completely independently of its creator. In this case, the programmer would be a <i class="calibre4">primum mobile</i>, a  rst mover, but his creation would be free to evolve in directions neither its maker nor any other human could ever have envisaged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A prototype for such a program already exists – it’s called a computer virus. As it spreads through the Internet, the virus replicates itself millions upon millions of times, all the while being chased by predatory antivirus programs and competing with  other  viruses  for  a  place  in  cyberspace.  One  day  when  the  virus  replicates itself  a  mistake  occurs  –  a  computerised  mutation.  Perhaps  the  mutation  occurs because  the  human  engineer  programmed  the  virus  to  make  occasional  random replication  mistakes.  Perhaps  the  mutation  was  due  to  a  random  error.  If,  by chance, the modi ed virus is better at evading antivirus programs without losing its ability to invade other computers, it will spread through cyberspace. If so, the mutants will survive and reproduce. As time goes by, cyberspace would be full of new viruses that nobody engineered, and that undergo non-organic evolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are these living creatures? It depends on what you mean by ‘living creatures’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  have  certainly  been  produced  by  a  new  evolutionary  process,  completely independent of the laws and limitations of organic evolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine  another  possibility  –  suppose  you  could  back  up  your  brain  to  a portable hard drive and then run it on your laptop. Would your laptop be able to think and feel just like a Sapiens? If so, would it be you or someone else? What if computer programmers could create an entirely new but digital mind, composed of  computer  code,  complete  with  a  sense  of  self,  consciousness  and  memory?  If you  ran the program on your computer, would it be a person? If you deleted it could you be charged with murder? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  might  soon  have  the  answer  to  such  questions.  The  Human  Brain  Project, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p347"></a>founded  in  2005,  hopes  to  recreate  a  complete  human  brain  inside  a  computer, with electronic circuits in the computer emulating neural networks in the brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The projects director has claimed that, if funded properly, within a decade or two we  could  have  an  arti cial  human  brain  inside  a  computer  that  could  talk  and behave very much as a human does. If successful, that would mean that after 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">billion years of milling around inside the small world of organic compounds, life will suddenly break out into the vastness of the inorganic realm, ready to take up shapes beyond our wildest dreams. Not all scholars agree that the mind works in a manner  analogous  to  today’s  digital  computers  –  and  if  it  doesn’t,  present-day computers would not be able to simulate it. Yet it would be foolish to categorically dismiss the possibility before giving it a try. In 2013 the project received a grant of €1 billion from the European Union. <a href="#p364">19</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Singularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently, only a tiny fraction of these new opportunities have been realised. Yet the world of 2014 is already a world in which culture is releasing itself from the shackles of biology. Our ability to engineer not merely the world around us, but above  all  the  world  inside  our  bodies  and  minds,  is  developing  at  breakneck speed.  More  and  more  spheres  of  activity  are  being  shaken  out  of  their complacent  ways.  Lawyers  need  to  rethink  issues  of  privacy  and  identity; governments are faced with rethinking matters of health care and equality; sports associations  and  educational  institutions  need  to  rede ne  fair  play  and achievement;  pension  funds  and  labour  markets  should  readjust  to  a  world  in which sixty might be the new thirty. They must all deal with the conundrums of bioengineering, cyborgs and inorganic life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mapping the  rst human genome required  fteen years and $3 billion. Today</p>
<p class="calibre1">you can map a person’s DNA within a few weeks and at the cost of a few hundred dollars. <a href="#p365">20 </a>The era of personalized medicine – medicine that matches treatment to DNA – has begun. The family doctor could soon tell you with greater certainty that you  face  high  risks  of  liver  cancer,  whereas  you  needn’t  worry  too  much  about heart  attacks.  She  could  determine  that  a  popular  medication  that  helps  92  per cent of people is useless to you, and you should instead take another pill, fatal to many  people  but  just  right  for  you.  The  road  to  near-perfect  medicine  stands before us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  with  improvements  in  medical  knowledge  will  come  new  ethical conundrums.  Ethicists  and  legal  experts  are  already  wrestling  with  the  thorny issue of privacy as it relates to DNA. Would insurance companies be entitled to ask</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a>for our DNA scans and to raise premiums if they discover a genetic tendency to reckless behaviour? Would we be required to fax our DNA, rather than our CV, to potential  employers?  Could  an  employer  favour  a  candidate  because  his  DNA looks better? Or could we sue in such cases for ‘genetic discrimination’? Could a company  that  develops  a  new  creature  or  a  new  organ  register  a  patent  on  its DNA sequences? It is obvious that one can own a particular chicken, but can one own an entire species? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such dilemmas are dwarfed by the ethical, social and political implications of the Gilgamesh Project and of our potential new abilities to create superhumans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  government  medical  programmes throughout  the  world,  national  health  insurance  programmes  and  national constitutions  worldwide  recognise  that  a  humane  society  ought  to  give  all  its members  fair  medical  treatment  and  keep  them  in  relatively  good  health.  That was all well and good as long as medicine was chie y concerned with preventing illness  and  healing  the  sick.  What  might  happen  once  medicine  becomes preoccupied  with  enhancing  human  abilities?  Would  all  humans  be  entitled  to such enhanced abilities, or would there be a new superhuman elite? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our late modern world prides itself on recognising, for the  rst time in history, the basic equality of all humans, yet it might be poised to create the most unequal of  all  societies.  Throughout  history,  the  upper  classes  always  claimed  to  be smarter,  stronger  and  generally  better  than  the  underclass.  They  were  usually deluding  themselves.  A  baby  born  to  a  poor  peasant  family  was  likely  to  be  as intelligent  as  the  crown  prince.  With  the  help  of  new  medical capabilities,  the pretensions of the upper classes might soon become an objective reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not science  ction. Most science- ction plots describe a world in which Sapiens  –  identical  to  us  –  enjoy  superior  technology  such  as  light-speed spaceships  and  laser  guns.  The  ethical  and  political  dilemmas  central  to  these plots are taken from our own world, and they merely recreate our emotional and social  tensions  against  a  futuristic  backdrop.  Yet  the  real  potential  of  future technologies is to change  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> itself, including our emotions and desires, and not merely our vehicles and weapons. What is a spaceship compared to an eternally young cyborg who does not breed and has no sexuality, who can share thoughts directly with other beings, whose abilities to focus and remember are a thousand  times  greater  than  our  own,  and  who  is  never  angry  or  sad,  but  has emotions and desires that we cannot begin to imagine? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Science  ction rarely describes such a future, because an accurate description is by  de nition  incomprehensible.  Producing  a  lm  about  the  life  of  some  super-cyborg is akin to producing  <i class="calibre4">Hamlet</i> for an audience of Neanderthals. Indeed, the future masters of the world will probably be more di erent from us than we are from  Neanderthals.  Whereas  we  and  the  Neanderthals  are  at  least  human,  our</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p349"></a>inheritors will be godlike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Physicists  de ne  the  Big  Bang  as  a  singularity.  It  is  a  point  at  which  all  the known laws of nature did not exist. Time too did not exist. It is thus meaningless to say that anything existed ‘before’ the Big Bang. We may be fast approaching a new singularity, when all the concepts that give meaning to our world – me, you, men, women, love and hate – will become irrelevant. Anything happening beyond that point is meaningless to us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Frankenstein Prophecy</p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1818 Mary Shelley published  <i class="calibre4">Frankenstein</i>, the story of a scientist who creates an  arti cial  being  that  goes  out  of  control  and  wreaks  havoc.  In  the  last  two centuries, the same story has been told over and over again in countless versions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has become a central pillar of our new scienti c mythology. At  rst sight, the Frankenstein story appears to warn us that if we try to play God and engineer life we will be punished severely. Yet the story has a deeper meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Frankenstein myth confronts  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> with the fact that the last days are fast approaching. Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe intervenes, so goes  the  story,  the  pace  of  technological  development  will  soon  lead  to  the replacement of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> by completely di erent beings who possess not only di erent physiques, but also very di erent cognitive and emotional worlds. This is something most Sapiens  nd extremely disconcerting. We like to believe that in the future people just like us will travel from planet to planet in fast spaceships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  don’t  like  to  contemplate  the  possibility  that  in  the  future,  beings  with emotions and identities like ours will no longer exist, and our place will be taken by alien life forms whose abilities dwarf our own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  somehow  nd  comfort  in  the  idea  that  Dr  Frankenstein  created  a  terrible monster, whom we had to destroy in order to save ourselves. We like to tell the story  that  way  because  it  implies  that  we  are  the  best  of  all  beings,  that  there never was and never will be something better than us. Any attempt to improve us will  inevitably  fail,  because  even  if  our  bodies  might  be  improved,  you  cannot touch the human spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We would have a hard time swallowing the fact that scientists could engineer spirits as well as bodies, and that future Dr Frankensteins could therefore create something truly superior to us, something that will look at us as condescendingly as we look at the Neanderthals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  cannot  be  certain  whether  today’s  Frankensteins  will  indeed  ful l  this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>prophecy. The future is unknown, and it would be surprising if the forecasts of the last few pages were realised in full. History teaches us that what seems to be just around  the  corner  may  never  materialise  due  to  unforeseen  barriers,  and  that other  unimagined  scenarios  will  in  fact  come  to  pass.  When  the  nuclear  age erupted in the 1940S, many forecasts were made about the future nuclear world of the  year  2000.  When  sputnik  and  <i class="calibre4">Apol o  11</i>  red  the  imagination  of  the  world, everyone began predicting that by the end of the century, people would be living in  space  colonies  on  Mars  and  Pluto.  Few  of  these  forecasts  came  true.  On  the other hand, nobody foresaw the Internet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  don’t  go  out  just  yet  to  buy  liability  insurance  to  indemnify  you  against lawsuits  led  by  digital  beings.  The  above  fantasies  –  or  nightmares  –  are  just stimulants for your imagination. What we should take seriously is the idea that the next  stage  of  history  will  include  not  only  technological  and  organisational transformations,  but  also  fundamental  transformations  in  human  consciousness and  identity.  And  these  could  be  transformations  so  fundamental  that  they  will call  the  very  term  ‘human’  into  question.  How  long  do  we  have?  No  one  really knows. As already mentioned, some say that by 2050 a few humans will already be  a-mortal.  Less  radical  forecasts  speak  of  the  next  century,  or  the  next millennium. Yet from the perspective of 70,000 years of Sapiens history, what are a few millennia? </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the curtain is indeed about to drop on Sapiens history, we members of one of its final generations should devote some time to answering one last question: what do  we  want  to  become?  This  question,  sometimes  known  as  the  Human Enhancement  question,  dwarfs  the  debates  that  currently  preoccupy  politicians, philosophers,  scholars  and  ordinary  people.  After  all,  today’s  debate  between today’s  religions,  ideologies,  nations  and  classes  will  in  all  likelihood  disappear along with  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. If our successors indeed function on a di erent level of consciousness (or perhaps possess something beyond consciousness that we cannot even conceive), it seems doubtful that Christianity or Islam will be of interest to them, that their social organisation could be Communist or capitalist, or that their genders could be male or female. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  yet  the  great  debates  of  history  are  important  because  at  least  the  rst generation  of  these  gods  would  be  shaped  by  the  cultural  ideas  of  their  human designers.  Would  they  be  created  in  the  image  of  capitalism,  of  Islam,  or  of feminism?  The  answer  to  this  question  might  send  them  careening  in  entirely different directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most people prefer not to think about it. Even the  eld of bioethics prefers to address another question, ‘What is it forbidden to do?’ Is it acceptable to carry out genetic experiments on living human beings? On aborted fetuses? On stem cells? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is  it  ethical  to  clone  sheep? And  chimpanzees?  And  what  about  humans?  All  of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p351"></a>these are important questions, but it is naïve to imagine that we might simply hit the brakes and stop the scienti c projects that are upgrading  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> into a di erent kind of being. For these projects are inextricably meshed together with the Gilgamesh Project. Ask scientists why they study the genome, or try to connect a brain to a computer, or try to create a mind inside a computer. Nine out of ten times you’ll get the same standard answer: we are doing it to cure diseases and save  human  lives.  Even  though  the  implications  of  creating  a  mind  inside  a computer  are  far  more  dramatic  than  curing  psychiatric  illnesses,  this  is  the standard  justi cation  given,  because  nobody  can  argue  with  it.  This  is  why  the Gilgamesh Project is the  agship of science. It serves to justify everything science does.  Dr  Frankenstein  piggybacks  on  the  shoulders  of  Gilgamesh.  Since  it  is impossible to stop Gilgamesh, it is also impossible to stop Dr Frankenstein. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  only  thing  we  can  try  to  do  is  to  in uence  the  direction  scientists  are taking. Since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too, perhaps the real question facing us is not ‘What do we want to become?’, but ‘What do we want to want?’  Those  who  are  not  spooked  by  this  question  probably  haven’t  given  it enough thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a>Afterword:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Animal that Became a God</p>
<p class="calibre1">SEVENTY  THOUSAND  YEARS  AGO,  <i class="calibre4">HOMO  sapiens</i>  was  still  an  insigni cant animal minding its own business in a corner of Africa. In the following millennia it  transformed  itself  into  the  master  of  the  entire  planet  and  the  terror  of  the ecosystem. Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god, poised to acquire not only eternal youth, but also the divine abilities of creation and destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we can be proud of. We have mastered our surroundings, increased food production, built cities, established empires and created far- ung trade networks. But did we decrease the amount of su ering in the world? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other animals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the last few decades we have at last made some real progress as far as the human condition is concerned, with the reduction of famine, plague and war. Yet the situation of other animals is deteriorating more rapidly than ever before, and the improvement in the lot of humanity is too recent and fragile to be certain of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, despite the astonishing things that humans are capable of doing, we remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever. We have advanced  from  canoes  to  galleys  to  steamships  to  space  shuttles  –  but  nobody knows where we’re going. We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. We are consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and on the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is there anything more dangerous than dissatis ed and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want? </p>
