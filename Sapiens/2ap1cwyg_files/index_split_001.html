<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">17. </b></a><b class="calibre3"> The Declaration of Independence of the United States, signed 4 July 1776</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  these  cooperation  networks  –  from  the  cities  of  ancient  Mesopotamia  to  the Qin and Roman empires – were ‘imagined orders’. The social norms that sustained them  were  based  neither  on  ingrained  instincts  nor  on  personal  acquaintances, but rather on belief in shared myths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  can  myths  sustain  entire  empires?  We  have  already  discussed  one  such example: Peugeot. Now let’s examine two of the best-known myths of history: the Code  of  Hammurabi  of  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1776 BC,  which  served  as  a  cooperation  manual  for hundreds of thousands of ancient Babylonians; and the American Declaration of Independence  of  1776 AD,  which  today  still  serves  as  a  cooperation  manual  for hundreds of millions of modern Americans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1776 BC  Babylon  was  the  world’s  biggest  city.  The  Babylonian Empire  was probably the world’s largest, with more than a million subjects. It ruled most of Mesopotamia, including the bulk of modern Iraq and parts of present-day Syria and Iran. The Babylonian king most famous today was Hammurabi. His fame is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>due primarily to the text that bears his name, the Code of Hammurabi. This was a collection of laws and judicial decisions whose aim was to present Hammurabi as a role model of a just king, serve as a basis for a more uniform legal system across the  Babylonian  Empire,  and  teach  future  generations  what  justice  is  and  how  a just king acts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Future generations took notice. The intellectual and bureaucratic elite of ancient Mesopotamia canonised the text, and apprentice scribes continued to copy it long after Hammurabi died and his empire lay in ruins. Hammurabi’s Code is therefore a  good  source  for  understanding  the  ancient  Mesopotamians’  ideal  of  social order. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  text  begins  by  saying  that  the  gods  Anu,  Enlil  and  Marduk  –  the  leading deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon – appointed Hammurabi ‘to make justice prevail in the land, to abolish the wicked and the evil, to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak’. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">4 </a>It then lists about 300 judgements, given in the set formula</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘If such and such a thing happens, such is the judgment.’ For example, judgements 196–9 and 209–14 read:</p>
<p class="calibre1">If a superior man should blind the eye of another superior man, they shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">196.    blind his eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he should break the bone of another superior man, they shall break his</p>
<p class="calibre1">197. bone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he should blind the eye of a commoner or break the bone of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">198. commoner, he shall weigh and deliver 60 shekels of silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he should blind the eye of a slave of a superior man or break the bone of 199. a slave of a superior man, he shall weigh and deliver one-half of the slave’s value (in silver). <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If a superior man strikes a woman of superior class and thereby causes her</p>
<p class="calibre1">209. to miscarry her fetus, he shall weigh and deliver ten shekels of silver for her fetus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">210. If that woman should die, they shall kill his daughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he should cause a woman of commoner class to miscarry her fetus by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">211. beating, he shall weigh and deliver five shekels of silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">212. If that woman should die, he shall weigh and deliver thirty shekels of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he strikes a slave-woman of a superior man and thereby causes her to</p>
<p class="calibre1">213. miscarry her fetus, he shall weigh and deliver two shekels of silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If that slave-woman should die, he shall weigh and deliver twenty shekels</p>
<p class="calibre1">214. of silver. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">After listing his judgements, Hammurabi again declares that</p>
<p class="calibre1">These are the just decisions which Hammurabi, the able king, has established and thereby has directed the land along the course of truth and the correct way of life … I am Hammurabi, noble king. I have not been careless or negligent toward humankind, granted to my care by the god Enlil, and with whose shepherding the god Marduk charged me<a href="index_split_005.html#p357">.7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Hammurabi’s Code asserts that Babylonian social order is rooted in universal and eternal principles of justice, dictated by the gods. The principle of hierarchy is of paramount  importance.  According  to  the  code,  people  are  divided  into  two genders  and  three  classes:  superior  people,  commoners  and  slaves.  Members  of each  gender  and  class  have  di erent  values.  The  life  of  a  female  commoner  is worth  thirty  silver  shekels  and  that  of  a  slave-woman  twenty  silver  shekels, whereas the eye of a male commoner is worth sixty silver shekels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The code also establishes a strict hierarchy within families, according to which children  are  not  independent  persons,  but  rather  the  property  of  their  parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, if one superior man kills the daughter of another superior man, the killer’s daughter  is  executed  in  punishment.  To  us  it  may  seem  strange  that  the  killer remains unharmed whereas his innocent daughter is killed, but to Hammurabi and the Babylonians this seemed perfectly just. Hammurabi’s Code was based on the premise that if the king’s subjects all accepted their positions in the hierarchy and acted  accordingly,  the  empire’s  million  inhabitants  would  be  able  to  cooperate e ectively.  Their  society  could  then  produce  enough  food  for  its  members, distribute it e ciently, protect itself against its enemies, and expand its territory so as to acquire more wealth and better security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About 3,500 years after Hammurabi’s death, the inhabitants of thirteen  British colonies  in  North  America  felt  that  the  king  of  England  was  treating  them unjustly. Their representatives gathered in the city of Philadelphia, and on 4 July 1776  the  colonies  declared  that  their  inhabitants  were  no  longer  subjects  of  the British  Crown.  Their  Declaration  of  Independence  proclaimed  universal  and eternal principles of justice, which, like those of Hammurabi, were inspired by a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>divine  power.  However,  the  most  important  principle  dictated  by  the  American god was somewhat di erent from the principle dictated by the gods of Babylon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The American Declaration of Independence asserts that:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that al  men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  Hammurabi’s  Code,  the  American  founding  document  promises  that  if humans act according to its sacred principles, millions of them would be able to cooperate effectively, living safely and peacefully in a just and prosperous society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the Code of Hammurabi, the American Declaration of Independence was not just a document of its time and place – it was accepted by future generations as well. For more than 200 years, American schoolchildren have been copying and learning it by heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two texts present us with an obvious dilemma. Both the Code of Hammurabi and  the  American  Declaration  of  Independence  claim  to  outline  universal  and eternal principles of justice, but according to the Americans all people are equal, whereas  according  to  the  Babylonians  people  are  decidedly  unequal.  The Americans  would,  of  course,  say  that  they  are  right,  and  that  Hammurabi  is wrong.  Hammurabi,  naturally,  would  retort  that  he  is  right,  and  that  the Americans are wrong. In fact, they are both wrong. Hammurabi and the American Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy. Yet the only place where such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and in the myths they invent and tell one another. These principles have no objective validity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  easy  for  us  to  accept  that  the  division  of  people  into  ‘superiors’ and commoners’  is  a  gment  of  the  imagination.  Yet  the  idea  that  all  humans  are equal is also a myth. In what sense do all humans equal one another? Is there any objective reality, outside the human imagination, in which we are truly equal? Are all  humans  equal  to  one  another  biologically?  Let  us  try  to  translate  the  most famous line of the American Declaration of Independence into biological terms: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that al  men are <b class="calibre3">created equal</b>, that they are <b class="calibre3">endowed</b> by their <b class="calibre3">Creator</b> with certain <b class="calibre3">unalienable rights</b>, that among these are life, <b class="calibre3">liberty</b>, and the pursuit of <b class="calibre3">happiness</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to the science of biology, people were not created’. They have evolved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation. The Americans got the idea of equality from Christianity, which argues that every person has a divinely created soul, and that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>all  souls  are  equal  before  God.  However,  if  we  do  not  believe  in  the  Christian myths  about  God,  creation  and  souls,  what  does  it  mean  that  all  people  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘equal’? Evolution is based on di erence, not on equality. Every person carries a somewhat  di erent  genetic  code,  and  is  exposed  from  birth  to  di erent environmental in uences. This leads to the development of di erent qualities that carry with them di erent chances of survival. ‘Created equal’ should therefore be translated into ‘evolved differently’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as people were never created, neither, according to the science of biology, is  there  a  ‘Creator’  who  ‘endows’  them  with  anything.  There  is  only  a  blind evolutionary process, devoid of any purpose, leading to the birth of individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Endowed by their creator’ should be translated simply into ‘born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equally,  there  are  no  such  things  as  rights  in  biology.  There  are  only  organs, abilities  and  characteristics.  Birds  y  not  because  they  have  a  right  to  y,  but because  they  have  wings.  And  it’s  not  true  that  these  organs,  abilities  and characteristics are ‘unalienable’. Many of them undergo constant mutations, and may well be completely lost over time. The ostrich is a bird that lost its ability to fly. So ‘unalienable rights’ should be translated into ‘mutable characteristics’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what are the characteristics that evolved in humans? ‘Life’, certainly. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘liberty’? There is no such thing in biology. Just like equality, rights and limited liability companies, liberty is something that people invented and that exists only in  their  imagination.  From  a  biological  viewpoint,  it  is  meaningless  to  say  that humans  in  democratic  societies  are  free,  whereas  humans  in  dictatorships  are unfree. And what about ‘happiness’? So far biological research has failed to come up with a clear de nition of happiness or a way to measure it objectively. Most biological studies acknowledge only the existence of pleasure, which is more easily de ned  and  measured.  So  ‘life,  liberty,  and  the  pursuit  of  happiness’  should  be translated into ‘life and the pursuit of pleasure’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So here is that line from the American Declaration of Independence translated into biological terms:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that al  men evolved di erently, that they are born with certain mutable characteristics, and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Advocates of equality and human rights may be outraged by this line of reasoning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their response is likely to be, ‘We know that people are not equal biologically! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  if  we  believe  that  we  are  all  equal  in  essence,  it  will  enable  us  to  create  a stable and prosperous society.’ I have no argument with that. This is exactly what I  mean  by  ‘imagined  order’.  We  believe  in  a  particular  order  not  because  it  is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate e ectively and forge  a  better  society.  Imagined  orders  are  not  evil  conspiracies  or  useless</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>mirages. Rather, they are the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate e ectively.  Bear  in  mind,  though,  that  Hammurabi  might  have  defended  his principle  of  hierarchy  using  the  same  logic:  ‘I  know  that  superiors,  commoners and slaves are not inherently di erent kinds of people. But if we believe that they are, it will enable us to create a stable and prosperous society.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">True Believers</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s likely that more than a few readers squirmed in their chairs while reading the preceding paragraphs. Most of us today are educated to react in such a way. It is easy to accept that Hammurabi’s Code was a myth, but we do not want to hear that human rights are also a myth. If people realise that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn’t there a danger that our society will collapse? Voltaire said about God that ‘there is no God, but don’t tell that to my servant, lest he murder me  at  night’.  Hammurabi  would  have  said  the  same  about  his  principle  of hierarchy, and Thomas Je erson about human rights.  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> has no natural rights, just as spiders, hyenas and chimpanzees have no natural rights. But don’t tell that to our servants, lest they murder us at night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such fears are well justified. A natural order is a stable order. There is no chance that gravity will cease to function tomorrow, even if people stop believing in it. In contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon  myths,  and  myths  vanish  once  people  stop  believing  in  them.  In  order  to safeguard  an  imagined  order,  continuous  and  strenuous  e orts  are  imperative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  of  these  e orts  take  the  shape  of  violence  and  coercion.  Armies,  police forces,  courts  and  prisons  are  ceaselessly  at  work  forcing  people  to  act  in accordance  with  the  imagined  order.  If  an  ancient  Babylonian  blinded  his neighbour, some violence was usually necessary in order to enforce the law of ‘an eye  for  an  eye’.  When,  in  1860,  a  majority  of  American  citizens  concluded  that African slaves are human beings and must therefore enjoy the right of liberty, it took a bloody civil war to make the southern states acquiesce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, an imagined order cannot be sustained by violence alone. It requires some  true  believers  as  well.  Prince  Talleyrand,  who  began  his  chameleon-like career  under  Louis  XVI,  later  served  the  revolutionary  and  Napoleonic  regimes, and switched loyalties in time to end his days working for the restored monarchy, summed up decades of governmental experience by saying that ‘You can do many things with bayonets, but it is rather uncomfortable to sit on them.’ A single priest often  does  the  work  of  a  hundred  soldiers  far  more  cheaply  and  e ectively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, no matter how e cient bayonets are, somebody must wield them. Why</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>should the soldiers, jailors, judges and police maintain an imagined order in which they do not believe? Of all human collective activities, the one most di cult to organise  is  violence.  To  say  that  a  social  order  is  maintained  by  military  force immediately  raises  the  question:  what  maintains the  military  order?  It  is impossible  to  organise  an  army  solely  by  coercion.  At  least  some  of  the commanders  and  soldiers  must  truly  believe  in  something,  be  it  God,  honour, motherland, manhood or money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  even  more  interesting  question  concerns  those  standing  at  the  top  of  the social  pyramid.  Why  should  they  wish  to  enforce  an  imagined  order  if  they themselves don’t believe in it? It is quite common to argue that the elite may do so out of cynical greed. Yet a cynic who believes in nothing is unlikely to be greedy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It does not take much to provide the objective biological needs of  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After those needs are met, more money can be spent on building pyramids, taking holidays around the world,  nancing election campaigns, funding your favourite terrorist  organisation,  or  investing  in  the  stock  market  and  making  yet  more money  –  all  of  which  are  activities  that  a  true  cynic  would  nd  utterly meaningless.  Diogenes,  the  Greek  philosopher  who  founded  the  Cynical  school, lived  in  a  barrel.  When  Alexander  the  Great  once  visited  Diogenes  as  he  was relaxing  in  the  sun,  and  asked  if  there  were  anything  he  might  do  for  him,  the Cynic answered the all-powerful conqueror, ‘Yes, there is something you can do for me. Please move a little to the side. You are blocking the sunlight.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  why  cynics  don’t  build  empires  and  why  an  imagined  order  can  be maintained  only  if  large  segments  of  the  population  –  and  in  particular  large segments  of  the  elite  and  the  security  forces  –  truly  believe  in  it.  Christianity would not have lasted 2,000 years if the majority of bishops and priests failed to believe  in  Christ.  American  democracy  would  not  have  lasted  250  years  if  the majority  of  presidents  and  congressmen  failed  to  believe  in  human  rights.  The modern  economic  system  would  not  have  lasted  a  single  day  if  the  majority  of investors and bankers failed to believe in capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Prison Wal s</p>
<p class="calibre1">How  do  you  cause  people  to  believe  in  an  imagined  order  such  as  Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined. You always insist that the order sustaining society is an objective reality created by the great gods or by the laws of nature. People are unequal, not because Hammurabi said so, but because Enlil and Marduk decreed it. People are equal, not because Thomas Je erson said so, but because God created them that way. Free markets</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>are the best economic system, not because Adam Smith said so, but because these are the immutable laws of nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  also  educate  people  thoroughly.  From  the  moment  they  are  born,  you constantly  remind  them  of  the  principles  of  the  imagined  order,  which  are incorporated into anything and everything. They are incorporated into fairy tales, dramas,  paintings,  songs,  etiquette,  political  propaganda,  architecture,  recipes and fashions. For example, today people believe in equality, so it’s fashionable for rich kids to wear jeans, which were originally working-class attire. In the Middle Ages people believed in class divisions, so no young nobleman would have worn a peasant’s  smock.  Back  then,  to  be  addressed  as  ‘Sir’  or  ‘Madam’  was  a  rare privilege  reserved  for  the  nobility,  and  often  purchased  with  blood.  Today  all polite  correspondence,  regardless  of  the  recipient,  begins  with  ‘Dear  Sir  or Madam’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The humanities and social sciences devote most of their energies to explaining exactly how the imagined order is woven into the tapestry of life. In the limited space at our disposal we can only scratch the surface. Three main factors prevent people  from  realising  that  the  order  organising  their  lives  exists  only  in  their imagination:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">a.  The  imagined  order  is  embedded  in  the  material  world</b>.  Though  the imagined order exists only in our minds, it can be woven into the material reality around us, and even set in stone. Most Westerners today believe in individualism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They believe that every human is an individual, whose worth does not depend on what other people think of him or her. Each of us has within ourselves a brilliant ray of light that gives value and meaning to our lives. In modern Western schools teachers and parents tell children that if their classmates make fun of them, they should ignore it. Only they themselves, not others, know their true worth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In modern architecture, this myth leaps out of the imagination to take shape in stone and mortar. The ideal modern house is divided into many small rooms so that  each  child  can  have  a  private  space, hidden  from  view,  providing  for maximum  autonomy.  This  private  room  almost  invariably  has  a  door,  and  in many households it is accepted practice for the child to close, and perhaps lock, the  door.  Even  parents  are  forbidden  to  enter  without  knocking  and  asking permission. The room is decorated as the child sees  t, with rock-star posters on the  wall  and  dirty  socks  on  the  oor.  Somebody  growing  up  in  such  a  space cannot  help  but  imagine  himself  ‘an  individual’,  his  true  worth  emanating  from within rather than from without. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Medieval  noblemen  did  not  believe  in  individualism.  Someone’s  worth  was determined by their place in the social hierarchy, and by what other people said about  them.  Being  laughed  at  was  a  horrible  indignity.  Noblemen  taught  their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>children to protect their good name whatever the cost. Like modern individualism, the medieval value system left the imagination and was manifested in the stone of medieval  castles.  The  castle  rarely  contained  private  rooms  for  children  (or anyone else, for that matter). The teenage son of a medieval baron did not have a private  room  on  the  castle’s  second  oor,  with  posters  of  Richard  the  Lionheart and King Arthur on the walls and a locked door that his parents were not allowed to open. He slept alongside many other youths in a large hall. He was always on display and always had to take into account what others saw and said. Someone growing up in such conditions naturally concluded that a man’s true worth was determined by his place in the social hierarchy and by what other people said of him. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">b. The imagined order shapes our desires</b>. Most people do not wish to accept that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact every person is born into a pre-existing imagined order, and his or her desires are shaped from birth by its  dominant  myths.  Our  personal  desires  thereby  become  the  imagined  order’s most important defences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For instance, the most cherished desires of present-day Westerners are shaped by romantic, nationalist, capitalist and humanist myths that have been around for centuries. Friends giving advice often tell each other, ‘Follow your heart.’ But the heart is a double agent that usually takes its instructions from the dominant myths of the day, and the very recommendation to ‘Follow your heart’ was implanted in our minds by a combination of nineteenth-century Romantic myths and twentieth-century consumerist myths. The Coca-Cola Company, for example, has marketed Diet Coke around the world under the slogan, ‘Diet Coke. Do what feels good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  what  people  take  to  be  their  most  personal  desires  are  usually programmed  by  the  imagined  order.  Let’s  consider,  for  example,  the  popular desire to take a holiday abroad. There is nothing natural or obvious about this. A chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using his power in order to go on holiday into the territory of a neighbouring chimpanzee band. The elite of ancient Egypt spent their fortunes building pyramids and having their corpses mummi ed, but none of them thought of going shopping in Babylon or taking a skiing holiday in  Phoenicia.  People  today  spend  a  great  deal  of  money  on  holidays  abroad because they are true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we must have as many di erent experiences as we can. We must open ourselves to a wide  spectrum  of  emotions;  we  must  sample  various  kinds  of  relationships;  we must try di erent cuisines; we must learn to appreciate di erent styles of music. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the best ways to do all that is to break free from our daily routine, leave behind  our  familiar  setting,  and  go  travelling  in  distant  lands,  where  we  can</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a><img src="index-103_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">‘experience’ the culture, the smells, the tastes and the norms of other people. We hear again and again the romantic myths about ‘how a new experience opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">my eyes and changed my life’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consumerism  tells  us  that  in  order  to  be  happy  we  must  consume  as  many products and services as possible. If we feel that something is missing or not quite right, then we probably need to buy a product (a car, new clothes, organic food) or  a  service  (housekeeping,  relationship  therapy,  yoga  classes).  Every  television commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or service will make life better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanticism,  which  encourages  variety,  meshes  perfectly  with  consumerism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their marriage has given birth to the infinite ‘market of experiences’, on which the modern  tourism  industry  is  founded.  The  tourism  industry  does  not  sell  ight tickets  and  hotel  bedrooms.  It  sells  experiences.  Paris  is  not  a  city,  nor  India  a country  –  they  are  both  experiences,  the  consumption  of  which  is  supposed  to widen  our  horizons,  ful l  our  human  potential,  and  make  us  happier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently, when the relationship between a millionaire and his wife is going through a rocky patch, he takes her on an expensive trip to Paris. The trip is not a re ection of some independent desire, but rather of an ardent belief in the myths of  romantic  consumerism.  A  wealthy  man  in  ancient  Egypt  would  never  have dreamed of solving a relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, he might have built for her the sumptuous tomb she had always wanted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Like the elite of ancient Egypt, most people in most cultures dedicate their lives to building pyramids. Only the names, shapes and sizes of these pyramids change</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>from one culture to the other. They may take the form, for example, of a suburban cottage with a swimming pool and an evergreen lawn, or a gleaming penthouse with an enviable view. Few question the myths that cause us to desire the pyramid in the first place. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">c. The imagined order is inter-subjective</b>. Even if by some superhuman e ort I succeed in freeing my personal desires from the grip of the imagined order, I am just one person. In order to change the imagined order I must convince millions of strangers to cooperate with me. For the imagined order is not a subjective order existing in my own imagination – it is rather an inter-subjective order, existing in the shared imagination of thousands and millions of people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  understand  this,  we  need  to  understand  the  di erence  between</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘objective’, ‘subjective’, and ‘inter-subjective’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A n <b class="calibre3">objective</b>  phenomenon  exists  independently  of  human  consciousness  and human  beliefs.  Radioactivity,  for  example,  is  not  a  myth.  Radioactive  emissions occurred long before people discovered them, and they are dangerous even when people do not believe in them. Marie Curie, one of the discoverers of radioactivity, did not know, during her long years of studying radioactive materials, that they could harm her body. While she did not believe that radioactivity could kill her, she  nevertheless  died  of  aplastic  anaemia,  a  disease  caused  by  overexposure  to radioactive materials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The <b class="calibre3">subjective</b>  is  something  that  exists  depending  on  the  consciousness  and beliefs of a single individual. It disappears or changes if that particular individual changes his or her beliefs. Many a child believes in the existence of an imaginary friend who is invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world. The imaginary friend exists solely in the child’s subjective consciousness, and when the child grows up and ceases to believe in it, the imaginary friend fades away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">T h e <b class="calibre3">inter-subjective</b>  is  something  that  exists  within  the  communication network  linking  the  subjective  consciousness  of  many  individuals.  If  a  single individual  changes  his  or  her  beliefs,  or  even  dies,  it  is  of  little  importance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear. Inter-subjective phenomena are neither malevolent frauds nor insigni cant charades. They exist in a di erent way from physical phenomena such as radioactivity, but their impact on the world may still be enormous. Many of history’s most important drivers are inter-subjective: law, money, gods, nations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peugeot,  for  example,  is  not  the  imaginary  friend  of  Peugeot’s  CEO.  The company exists in the shared imagination of millions of people. The CEO believes in the company’s existence because the board of directors also believes in it, as do the company’s lawyers, the secretaries in the nearby o ce, the tellers in the bank, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>the brokers on the stock exchange, and car dealers from France to Australia. If the CEO  alone  were  suddenly  to  stop  believing  in  Peugeot’s  existence,  he’d  quickly land in the nearest mental hospital and someone else would occupy his office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarly, the dollar, human rights and the United States of America exist in the shared  imagination  of  billions,  and  no  single  individual  can  threaten  their existence. If I alone were to stop believing in the dollar, in human rights, or in the United  States,  it  wouldn’t  much  matter.  These  imagined  orders  are  inter-subjective,  so  in  order  to  change  them  we  must  simultaneously  change  the consciousness of billions of people, which is not easy. A change of such magnitude can  be  accomplished  only  with  the  help  of  a  complex  organisation,  such  as  a political party, an ideological movement, or a religious cult. However, in order to establish such complex organisations, it’s necessary to convince many strangers to cooperate with one another. And this will happen only if these strangers believe in  some  shared  myths.  It  follows  that  in  order  to  change  an  existing  imagined order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  dismantle  Peugeot,  for  example,  we  need  to  imagine  something more powerful, such as the French legal system. In order to dismantle the French legal  system  we  need  to  imagine  something  even  more  powerful,  such  as  the French state. And if we would like to dismantle that too, we will have to imagine something yet more powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  no  way  out  of  the  imagined  order.  When  we  break  down  our  prison walls  and  run  towards  freedom,  we  are  in  fact  running  into  the  more  spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a><b class="calibre3">7</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Memory Overload</p>
<p class="calibre1">EVOLUTION DID NOT ENDOW HUMANS with the ability to play football. True, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">produced legs for kicking, elbows for fouling and mouths for cursing, but all that this enables us to do is perhaps practise penalty kicks by ourselves. To get into a game with the strangers we  nd in the schoolyard on any given afternoon, we not only have to work in concert with ten teammates we may never have met before, we also need to know that the eleven players on the opposing team are playing by the same rules. Other animals that engage strangers in ritualised aggression do so largely by instinct – puppies throughout the world have the rules for rough-and-tumble play hard-wired into their genes. But human teenagers have no genes for football.  They  can  nevertheless  play  the  game  with  complete  strangers  because they  have  all  learned  an  identical  set  of  ideas  about  football.  These  ideas  are entirely imaginary, but if everyone shares them, we can all play the game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same applies, on a larger scale, to kingdoms, churches and trade networks, with  one  important  di erence.  The  rules  of  football  are  relatively  simple  and concise,  much  like  those  necessary  for  cooperation  in  a  forager  band  or  small village.  Each  player  can  easily  store  them  in  his  brain  and  still  have  room  for songs,  images  and  shopping  lists.  But  large  systems  of  cooperation  that  involve not  twenty-two  but  thousands  or  even  millions  of  humans  require  the  handling and storage of huge amounts of information, much more than any single human brain can contain and process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The large societies found in some other species, such as ants and bees, are stable and resilient because most of the information needed to sustain them is encoded in the genome. A female honeybee larva can, for example, grow up to be either a queen  or  a  worker,  depending  on  what  food  it  is  fed.  Its  DNA  programmes  the necessary  behaviours  for  whatever  role  it  will  ful l  in  life.  Hives  can  be  very complex  social  structures,  containing  many  di erent  kinds  of  workers,  such  as harvesters, nurses and cleaners. But so far researchers have failed to locate lawyer bees. Bees don’t need lawyers, because there is no danger that they might forget or violate the hive constitution. The queen does not cheat the cleaner bees of their food, and they never go on strike demanding higher wages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  humans  do  such  things  all  the  time.  Because  the  Sapiens  social  order  is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>imagined, humans cannot preserve the critical information for running it simply by making copies of their DNA and passing these on to their progeny. A conscious e ort has to be made to sustain laws, customs, procedures and manners, otherwise the  social  order  would  quickly  collapse.  For  example,  King  Hammurabi  decreed that people are divided into superiors, commoners and slaves. Unlike the beehive class system, this is not a natural division – there is no trace of it in the human genome. If the Babylonians could not keep this ‘truth’ in mind, their society would have  ceased  to  function.  Similarly,  when  Hammurabi  passed  his  DNA  to  his o spring, it did not encode his ruling that a superior man who killed a commoner woman must pay thirty silver shekels. Hammurabi deliberately had to instruct his sons in the laws of his empire, and his sons and grandsons had to do the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Empires generate huge amounts of information. Beyond laws, empires have to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep  accounts  of  transactions  and  taxes,  inventories  of  military  supplies  and merchant  vessels,  and  calendars  of  festivals  and  victories.  For  millions  of  years people  stored  information  in  a  single  place  –  their  brains.  Unfortunately,  the human  brain  is  not  a  good  storage  device  for  empire-sized  databases,  for  three main reasons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, its capacity is limited. True, some people have astonishing memories, and in ancient times there were memory professionals who could store in their heads the  topographies  of  whole  provinces  and  the  law  codes  of  entire  states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,  there  is  a  limit  that  even  master  mnemonists  cannot  transcend.  A lawyer  might  know  by  heart  the  entire  law  code  of  the  Commonwealth  of Massachusetts, but  not  the  details  of  every  legal  proceeding  that  took  place  in Massachusetts from the Salem witch trials onward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, humans die, and their brains die with them. Any information stored in a  brain  will  be  erased  in  less  than  a  century.  It  is,  of  course,  possible  to  pass memories  from  one  brain  to  another,  but  after  a  few  transmissions,  the information tends to get garbled or lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirdly and most importantly, the human brain has been adapted to store and process only particular types of information. In order to survive, ancient hunter-gatherers  had  to  remember  the  shapes,  qualities  and  behaviour  patterns  of thousands  of  plant  and  animal  species.  They  had  to  remember  that  a  wrinkled yellow  mushroom  growing  in  autumn  under  an  elm  tree  is  most  probably poisonous, whereas a similar-looking mushroom growing in winter under an oak tree is a good stomach-ache remedy. Hunter-gatherers also had to bear in mind the opinions  and  relations  of  several  dozen  band  members.  If  Lucy  needed  a  band member’s  help  to  get  John  to  stop  harassing  her,  it  was  important  for  her  to remember  that  John  had  fallen  out  last  week  with  Mary,  who  would  thus  be  a likely  and  enthusiastic  ally.  Consequently,  evolutionary  pressures  have  adapted the  human  brain  to  store  immense  quantities  of  botanical,  zoological, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>topographical and social information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  when  particularly  complex  societies  began  to  appear  in  the  wake  of  the Agricultural  Revolution,  a  completely  new  type  of  information  became  vital  –</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers. Foragers were never obliged to handle large amounts of mathematical data. No forager needed to remember, say, the number of fruit on each tree in the forest. So human brains did not adapt to storing and processing numbers. Yet in order  to  maintain  a  large  kingdom,  mathematical  data  was  vital.  It  was  never enough  to  legislate  laws  and  tell  stories  about  guardian  gods.  One  also  had  to collect taxes. In order to tax hundreds of thousands of people, it was imperative to collect data about peoples incomes and possessions; data about payments made; data  about  arrears,  debts  and  nes;  data  about  discounts  and  exemptions.  This added up to millions of data bits, which had to be stored and processed. Without this capacity, the state would never know what resources it had and what further resources  it  could  tap.  When confronted  with  the  need  to  memorise,  recall  and handle all these numbers, most human brains overdosed or fell asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This mental limitation severely constrained the size and complexity of human collectives.  When  the  amount  of  people  and  property  in  a  particular  society crossed  a  critical  threshold,  it  became  necessary  to  store  and  process  large amounts of mathematical data. Since the human brain could not do it, the system collapsed. For thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution, human social networks remained relatively small and simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst  to  overcome  the  problem  were  the  ancient  Sumerians,  who  lived  in southern  Mesopotamia.  There,  a  scorching  sun  beating  upon  rich  muddy  plains produced plentiful harvests and prosperous towns. As the number of inhabitants grew,  so  did  the  amount  of  information  required  to  coordinate  their  a airs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between  the  years  3500 BC  and  3000 BC,  some  unknown  Sumerian  geniuses invented a system for storing and processing information outside their brains, one that  was  custom-built  to  handle  large  amounts  of  mathematical  data.  The Sumerians  thereby  released  their  social  order  from  the  limitations  of  the  human brain, opening the way for the appearance of cities, kingdoms and empires. The data-processing system invented by the Sumerians is called ‘writing’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signed, Kushim</p>
<p class="calibre1">Writing is a method for storing information through material signs. The Sumerian writing system did so by combining two types of signs, which were pressed in clay tablets.  One  type  of  signs  represented  numbers.  There  were  signs  for  1,  10,  60, 600, 3,600 and 36,000. (The Sumerians used a combination of base-6 and base-10</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><img src="index-109_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">numeral systems. Their base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies, such as the division of the day into twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360</p>
<p class="calibre1">degrees.)  The  other  type  of  signs  represented  people,  animals,  merchandise, territories,  dates  and  so  forth.  By  combining  both  types  of  signs  the  Sumerians were  able  to  preserve  far  more  data  than  any  human  brain  could  remember  or any DNA chain could encode. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">19. </b></a><b class="calibre3">A clay tablet with an administrative text from the city of Uruk</b>,  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">c</b></i><b class="calibre3">.3400–3000 BC. ‘Kushim’ may be the</b> <b class="calibre3">generic title of an officeholder, or the name of a particular individual. If Kushim was indeed a person, he</b> <b class="calibre3">may be the first individual in history whose name is known to us! All the names applied earlier in human</b> <b class="calibre3">history – the Neanderthals, the Natufians, Chauvet Cave, Göbekli Tepe – are modern inventions. We have</b> <b class="calibre3">no idea what the builders of Göbekli Tepe actually called the place. With the appearance of writing, we</b> <b class="calibre3">are beginning to hear history through the ears of its protagonists. When Kushim’s neighbours called out</b> <b class="calibre3">to him, they might really have shouted ‘Kushim!’ It is telling that the first recorded name in history</b> <b class="calibre3">belongs to an accountant, rather than a prophet, a poet or a great conqueror. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">1</a></b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At this early stage, writing was limited to facts and  gures. The great Sumerian novel,  if  there  ever  was  one,  was  never  committed  to  clay  tablets.  Writing  was time-consuming and the reading public tiny, so no one saw any reason to use it for anything other than essential record-keeping. If we look for the  rst words of wisdom  reaching  us  from  our  ancestors,  5,000  years  ago,  we’re  in  for  a  big disappointment.  The  earliest  messages  our  ancestors  have  left  us  read,  for example, ‘29,086 measures barley 37 months Kushim.’ The most probable reading of this sentence is: ‘A total of 29,086 measures of barley were received over the course  of  37  months.  Signed,  Kushim.’  Alas,  the  rst  texts  of  history  contain  no philosophical insights, no poetry, legends, laws, or even royal triumphs. They are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a><img src="index-110_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">humdrum economic documents, recording the payment of taxes, the accumulation of debts and the ownership of property. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Partial script cannot express the entire spectrum of a spoken language, but it can express things that fall</b> <b class="calibre3">outside the scope of spoken language. Partial scripts such as the Sumerian and mathematical scripts</b> <b class="calibre3">cannot be used to write poetry, but they can keep tax accounts very effectively</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only one other type of text survived from these ancient days, and it is even less exciting:  lists  of  words,  copied  over  and  over  again  by  apprentice  scribes  as training  exercises.  Even  had  a  bored  student  wanted  to  write  out  some  of  his poems  instead  of  copy  a  bill  of  sale,  he  could  not  have  done  so.  The  earliest Sumerian writing was a partial rather than a full script. Full script is a system of material signs that can represent spoken language more or less completely. It can therefore express everything people can say, including poetry. Partial script, on the  other  hand,  is  a  system  of  material  signs  that  can  represent  only  particular types of information, belonging to a limited  eld of activity. Latin script, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and Braille are full scripts. You can use them to write tax registers,  love  poems,  history  books,  food  recipes  and  business  law.  In  contrast, the  earliest  Sumerian  script,  like  modern  mathematical  symbols  and  musical notation,  are  partial  scripts.  You  can  use  mathematical  script  to  make calculations, but you cannot use it to write love poems. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a><img src="index-111_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">It didn’t disturb the Sumerians that their script was ill-suited for writing poetry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  didn’t  invent  it  in  order  to  copy  spoken  language,  but  rather  to  do  things that spoken language failed at. There were some cultures, such as those of the pre-Columbian Andes, which used only partial scripts throughout their entire histories, unfazed by their scripts’ limitations and feeling no need for a full version. Andean script was very di erent from its Sumerian counterpart. In fact, it was so di erent that many people would argue it wasn’t a script at all. It was not written on clay tablets or pieces of paper. Rather, it was written by tying knots on colourful cords called  quipus.  Each  quipu  consisted  of  many  cords  of  di erent  colours,  made  of wool or cotton. On each cord, several knots were tied in di erent places. A single quipu  could  contain  hundreds  of  cords  and  thousands  of  knots.  By  combining di erent knots on di erent cords with di erent colours, it was possible to record large  amounts  of mathematical data relating to, for example, tax collection and property ownership. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">For hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, quipus were essential to the business of cities, kingdoms and empires. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">3 </a>They reached their full potential under the Inca Empire, which ruled 10–12 million people and covered today’s Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, as well as chunks of Chile, Argentina and Colombia. Thanks to quipus, the Incas could save and process large amounts of data, without which they would not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>have been able to maintain the complex administrative machinery that an empire of that size requires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, quipus were so e ective and accurate that in the early years following the Spanish conquest of South America, the Spaniards themselves employed quipus in  the  work  of  administering  their  new  empire.  The  problem  was  that  the Spaniards did not themselves know how to record and read quipus, making them dependent  on  local  professionals.  The  continent’s  new  rulers  realised  that  this placed them in a tenuous position – the native quipu experts could easily mislead and cheat their overlords. So once Spain’s dominion was more  rmly established, quipus were phased out and the new empire’s records were kept entirely in Latin script and numerals. Very few quipus survived the Spanish occupation, and most of  those  remaining  are  undecipherable,  since,  unfortunately,  the  art  of  reading quipus has been lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Wonders of Bureaucracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Mesopotamians eventually started to want to write down things other than monotonous  mathematical  data.  Between  3000 BC  and  2500 BC  more  and  more signs  were  added  to  the  Sumerian  system,  gradually  transforming  it  into  a  full script  that  we  today  call  cuneiform.  By  2500 BC,  kings  were  using  cuneiform  to issue decrees, priests were using it to record oracles, and less exalted citizens were using it to write personal letters. At roughly the same time, Egyptians developed another  full  script  known  as  hieroglyphics.  Other  full  scripts  were  developed  in China around 1200 BC and in Central America around 1000–500 BC. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  these  initial  centres,  full  scripts  spread  far  and  wide,  taking  on  various new  forms  and  novel  tasks.  People  began  to  write  poetry,  history  books, romances, dramas, prophecies and cookbooks. Yet writing’s most important task continued  to  be  the  storage  of  reams  of  mathematical  data,  and  that  task remained the prerogative of partial script. The Hebrew Bible, the Greek  <i class="calibre4">Iliad</i>, the Hindu Mahabharata and the Buddhist Tipitika all began as oral works. For many generations  they  were  transmitted  orally  and  would  have  lived  on  even  had writing  never  been  invented.  But  tax  registries  and  complex  bureaucracies  were born together with partial script, and the two remain inexorably linked to this day like Siamese twins – think of the cryptic entries in computerised data bases and spreadsheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  more  and  more  things  were  written,  and  particularly  as  administrative archives grew to huge proportions, new problems appeared. Information stored in a persons brain is easy to retrieve. My brain stores billions of bits of data, yet I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>can  quickly,  almost  instantaneously,  recall  the  name  of  Italy’s  capital, immediately  afterwards  recollect  what  I  did  on  11  September  2001,  and  then reconstruct  the  route  leading  from  my  house  to  the  Hebrew  University  in Jerusalem. Exactly how the brain does it remains a mystery, but we all know that the brain’s retrieval system is amazingly e cient, except when you are trying to remember where you put your car keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How, though, do you find and retrieve information stored on quipu cords or clay tablets? If you have just ten tablets or a hundred tablets, it’s not a problem. But what  if  you  have  accumulated  thousands  of  them,  as  did  one  of  Hammurabi’s contemporaries, King Zimrilim of Mari? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine  for  a  moment  that  it’s  1776 BC.  Two  Marians  are  quarrelling  over possession of a wheat  eld. Jacob insists that he bought the  eld from Esau thirty years ago. Esau retorts that he in fact rented the  eld to Jacob for a term of thirty years, and that now, the term being up, he intends to reclaim it. They shout and wrangle and start pushing one another before they realise that they can resolve their dispute by going to the royal archive, where are housed the deeds and bills of sale that apply to all the kingdom’s real estate. Upon arriving at the archive they are shuttled from one o cial to the other. They wait through several herbal tea breaks, are told to come back tomorrow, and eventually are taken by a grumbling clerk to look for the relevant clay tablet. The clerk opens a door and leads them into a huge room lined,  oor to ceiling, with thousands of clay tablets. No wonder the  clerk  is  sour-faced.  How  is  he  supposed  to  locate  the  deed  to  the  disputed wheat  eld written thirty years ago? Even if he  nds it, how will he be able to cross-check  to  ensure  that  the  one  from  thirty  years  ago  is  the  latest  document relating to the  eld in question? If he can’t  nd it, does that prove that Esau never sold or rented out the  eld? Or just that the document got lost, or turned to mush when some rain leaked into the archive? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, just imprinting a document in clay is not enough to guarantee e cient, accurate and convenient data processing. That requires methods of organisation like  catalogues,  methods  of  reproduction  like  photocopy  machines,  methods  of rapid and accurate retrieval like computer algorithms, and pedantic (but hopefully cheerful) librarians who know how to use these tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inventing such methods proved to be far more di cult than inventing writing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  writing  systems  developed  independently  in  cultures  distant  in  time  and place from each other. Every decade archaeologists discover another few forgotten scripts. Some of them might prove to be even older than the Sumerian scratches in clay. But most of them remain curiosities because those who invented them failed to invent e cient ways of cataloguing and retrieving data. What set apart Sumer, as  well  as  pharaonic  Egypt,  ancient  China  and  the  Inca  Empire,  is  that  these cultures  developed  good  techniques  of  archiving,  cataloguing  and  retrieving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>written  records.  They  also  invested  in  schools  for  scribes,  clerks,  librarians  and accountants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A writing exercise from a school in ancient Mesopotamia discovered by modern archaeologists gives us a glimpse into the lives of these students, some 4,000 years ago:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I went in and sat down, and my teacher read my tablet. He said, ‘There’s something missing!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">And he caned me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the people in charge said, ‘Why did you open your mouth without my permission?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">And he caned me. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Ancient scribes learned not merely to read and write, but also to use catalogues, dictionaries, calendars, forms and tables. They studied and internalised techniques of  cataloguing,  retrieving  and  processing  information  very  di erent  from  those used by the brain. In the brain, all data is freely associated. When I go with my spouse to sign on a mortgage for our new home, I am reminded of the  rst place we lived together, which reminds me of our honeymoon in New Orleans, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminds me of alligators, which remind me of dragons, which remind me of  <i class="calibre4">The</i> <i class="calibre4">Ring of the Nibelungen</i>, and suddenly, before I know it, there I am humming the Siegfried  leitmotif  to  a  puzzled  bank  clerk.  In  bureaucracy,  things  must  be  kept apart. There is one drawer for home mortgages, another for marriage certi cates, a third for tax registers, and a fourth for lawsuits. Otherwise, how can you  nd anything?  Things  that  belong  in  more  than  one  drawer,  like  Wagnerian  music dramas (do I  le them under ‘music’, ‘theatre’, or perhaps invent a new category altogether?),  are  a  terrible  headache.  So  one  is  forever  adding,  deleting  and rearranging drawers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to function, the people who operate such a system of drawers must be reprogrammed  to  stop  thinking  as  humans  and  to  start  thinking  as  clerks  and accountants.  As  everyone  from  ancient  times  till  today  knows,  clerks  and accountants think in a non-human fashion. They think like  ling cabinets. This is not their fault. If they don’t think that way their drawers will all get mixed up and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>they  won’t  be  able  to  provide  the  services  their  government,  company  or organisation  requires.  The  most  important  impact  of  script  on  human  history  is precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Free association and holistic thought have given way to compartmentalisation and bureaucracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Language of Numbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the centuries passed, bureaucratic methods of data processing grew ever more di erent  from  the  way  humans  naturally  think  –  and  ever  more  important.  A critical step was made sometime before the ninth century AD, when a new partial script  was  invented,  one  that  could  store  and  process  mathematical  data  with unprecedented  e ciency.  This  partial  script  was  composed  of  ten  signs, representing  the  numbers  from  0  to  9.  Confusingly,  these  signs  are  known  as Arabic numerals even though they were  rst invented by the Hindus (even more confusingly,  modern  Arabs  use  a  set  of  digits  that  look  quite  di erent  from Western ones). But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded India they encountered  the  system,  understood  its  usefulness,  re ned  it,  and  spread  it through the Middle East and then to Europe. When several other signs were later added  to  the  Arab  numerals  (such  as  the  signs  for  addition,  subtraction  and multiplication), the basis of modern mathematical notation came into being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  this  system  of  writing  remains  a  partial  script,  it  has  become  the world’s  dominant  language.  Almost  all  states,  companies,  organisations  and institutions  –  whether  they  speak  Arabic,  Hindi,  English  or  Norwegian  –  use mathematical script to record and process data. Every piece of information that can  be  translated  into  mathematical  script  is  stored,  spread  and  processed  with mind-boggling speed and efficiency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A person who wishes to in uence the decisions of governments, organisations and companies must therefore learn to speak in numbers. Experts do their best to translate even ideas such as ‘poverty’, ‘happiness’ and ‘honesty’ into numbers (‘the poverty  line’,  ‘subjective  well-being  levels’,  ‘credit  rating’).  Entire  elds  of knowledge,  such  as  physics  and  engineering,  have  already  lost  almost  all  touch with  the  spoken  human  language,  and  are  maintained  solely  by  mathematical script. </p>

<p class="calibre1">More  recently,  mathematical  script  has  given  rise  to  an  even  more revolutionary writing system, a computerised binary script consisting of only two signs: 0 and 1. The words I am now typing on my keyboard are written within my computer by different combinations of 0 and 1. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Writing was born as the maidservant of human consciousness, but is increasingly becoming  its  master.  Our  computers  have  trouble  understanding  how  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i> talks, feels and dreams. So we are teaching  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> to talk, feel and dream in the language of numbers, which can be understood by computers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is not the end of the story. The  eld of arti cial intelligence is seeking to create a new kind of intelligence based solely on the binary script of computers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Science- ction  movies  such  as  <i class="calibre4">The Matrix</i>  and  <i class="calibre4">The Terminator</i>  tell  of  a  day  when the  binary  script  throws  o   the  yoke  of  humanity.

<p class="calibre1">There is No Justice in History</p>
<p class="calibre1">UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HISTORY IN THE millennia following the Agricultural</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution boils down to a single question: how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to  sustain  such  networks?  The  short  answer  is  that  humans  created  imagined orders  and  devised  scripts.  These  two  inventions  lled  the  gaps  left  by  our biological inheritance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the appearance of these networks was, for many, a dubious blessing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The imagined orders sustaining these networks were neither neutral nor fair. They divided  people  into  make-believe  groups,  arranged  in  a  hierarchy.  The  upper levels  enjoyed  privileges  and  power,  while  the  lower  ones  su ered  from discrimination  and  oppression.  Hammurabi’s  Code,  for  example,  established  a pecking  order  of  superiors,  commoners  and  slaves.  Superiors  got  all  the  good things  in  life.  Commoners  got  what  was  left.  Slaves  got  a  beating  if  they complained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  its  proclamation  of  the  equality  of  all  men,  the  imagined  order established  by  the  Americans  in  1776  also  established  a  hierarchy.  It  created  a hierarchy  between  men,  who  bene ted  from  it,  and  women,  whom  it  left disempowered.  It  created  a  hierarchy  between  whites,  who  enjoyed  liberty,  and blacks and American Indians, who were considered humans of a lesser type and therefore did not share in the equal rights of men. Many of those who signed the Declaration of Independence were slaveholders. They did not release their slaves upon signing the Declaration, nor did they consider themselves hypocrites. In their view, the rights of  <i class="calibre4">men</i> had little to do with Negroes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The American order also consecrated the hierarchy between rich and poor. Most Americans at that time had little problem with the inequality caused by wealthy parents  passing  their  money  and  businesses  on  to  their  children.  In  their  view, equality meant simply that the same laws applied to rich and poor. It had nothing to  do  with  unemployment  bene ts,  integrated  education  or  health  insurance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liberty, too, carried very di erent connotations than it does today. In 1776, it did not mean that the disempowered (certainly not blacks or Indians or, God forbid, women) could gain and exercise power. It meant simply that the state could not, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a><img src="index-119_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">except in unusual circumstances, con scate a citizen’s private property or tell him what to do with it. The American order thereby upheld the hierarchy of wealth, which some thought was mandated by God and others viewed as representing the immutable  laws  of  nature.  Nature,  it  was  claimed,  rewarded  merit  with  wealth while penalising indolence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  the  above-mentioned  distinctions  –  between  free  persons  and  slaves, between whites and blacks, between rich and poor – are rooted in  ctions. (The hierarchy  of  men  and  women  will  be  discussed  later.)  Yet  it  is  an  iron  rule  of history that every imagined hierarchy disavows its  ctional origins and claims to be  natural  and  inevitable.  For  instance,  many  people  who  have  viewed  the hierarchy  of  free  persons  and  slaves  as  natural  and  correct  have  argued  that slavery  is  not  a  human  invention.  Hammurabi  saw  it  as  ordained  by  the  gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aristotle  argued  that  slaves  have  a  ‘slavish  nature’  whereas  free  people  have  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘free nature’. Their status in society is merely a reflection of their innate nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ask  white  supremacists  about  the  racial  hierarchy,  and  you  are  in  for  a pseudoscienti c  lecture  concerning  the  biological  di erences  between  the  races. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You are likely to be told that there is something in Caucasian blood or genes that makes whites naturally more intelligent, moral and hardworking. Ask a diehard capitalist about the hierarchy of wealth, and you are likely to hear that it is the inevitable outcome of objective di erences in abilities. The rich have more money, in  this  view,  because  they  are  more  capable  and  diligent.  No  one  should  be bothered, then, if the wealthy get better health care, better education and better nutrition. The rich richly deserve every perk they enjoy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hindus  who  adhere  to  the  caste  system  believe  that  cosmic  forces  have  made one  caste  superior  to  another.  According  to  a  famous  Hindu  creation  myth,  the gods fashioned the world out of the body of a primeval being, the Purusa. The sun was  created  from  the  Purusa’s  eye,  the  moon  from  the  Purusa’s  brain,  the Brahmins  (priests)  from  its  mouth,  the  Kshatriyas  (warriors)  from  its  arms,  the Vaishyas  (peasants  and  merchants)  from  its  thighs,  and  the  Shudras  (servants) from  its  legs.  Accept  this  explanation  and  the  sociopolitical  di erences  between Brahmins and Shudras are as natural and eternal as the di erences between the sun and the moon. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">1 </a>The ancient Chinese believed that when the goddess Nü Wa created humans from earth, she kneaded aristocrats from  ne yellow soil, whereas commoners were formed from brown mud. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,  to  the  best  of  our  understanding,  these  hierarchies  are  all  the  product  of human  imagination.  Brahmins  and  Shudras  were  not  really  created  by  the  gods from different body parts of a primeval being. Instead, the distinction between the two castes was created by laws and norms invented by humans in northern India about  3,000  years  ago.  Contrary  to  Aristotle,  there  is  no  known  biological di erence between slaves and free people. Human laws and norms have turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">some people into slaves and others into masters. Between blacks and whites there are some objective biological di erences, such as skin colour and hair type, but there is no evidence that the differences extend to intelligence or morality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most people claim that their social hierarchy is natural and just, while those of other societies are based on false and ridiculous criteria. Modern Westerners are taught  to  sco   at  the  idea  of  racial  hierarchy.  They  are  shocked  by  laws prohibiting blacks to live in white neighbourhoods, or to study in white schools, or to  be  treated  in  white  hospitals.  But  the  hierarchy  of  rich  and  poor  –  which mandates  that  rich  people  live  in  separate  and  more  luxurious  neighbourhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, and receive medical treatment in separate  and  better-equipped  facilities  –  seems  perfectly  sensible  to  many Americans and Europeans. Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, complex human societies seem to require imagined hierarchies and unjust  discrimination.  Of  course  not  all  hierarchies  are  morally  identical,  and some societies su ered from more extreme types of discrimination than others, yet scholars  know  of  no  large  society  that  has  been  able  to  dispense  with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>discrimination  altogether.  Time  and  again  people  have  created  order  in  their societies by classifying the population into imagined categories, such as superiors, commoners and slaves; whites and blacks; patricians and plebeians; Brahmins and Shudras;  or  rich  and  poor.  These  categories  have  regulated  relations  between millions of humans by making some people legally, politically or socially superior to others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hierarchies  serve  an  important  function.  They  enable  complete  strangers  to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to become  personally  acquainted.  In  George Bernard  Shaw’s  <i class="calibre4">Pygmalion</i>,  Henry Higgins doesn’t need to establish an intimate acquaintance with Eliza Doolittle in order to understand how he should relate to her. Just hearing her talk tells him that she is a member of the underclass with whom he can do as he wishes – for example, using her as a pawn in his bet to pass o  a  ower girl as a duchess. A modern  Eliza  working  at  a  orist’s  needs  to  know  how  much  e ort  to  put  into selling roses and gladioli to the dozens of people who enter the shop each day. She can’t  make  a  detailed  enquiry  into  the  tastes  and  wallets  of  each  individual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, she uses social cues – the way the person is dressed, his or her age, and if she’s  not  politically  correct  his  skin  colour.  That  is  how  she  immediately distinguishes  between  the  accounting- rm  partner  who’s  likely  to  place  a  large order for expensive roses, and a messenger boy who can only a ord a bunch of daisies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  course,  di erences  in  natural  abilities  also  play  a  role  in  the  formation  of social  distinctions.  But  such  diversities  of  aptitudes  and  character  are  usually mediated through imagined hierarchies. This happens in two important ways. First and foremost, most abilities have to be nurtured and developed. Even if somebody is born with a particular talent, that talent will usually remain latent if it is not fostered, honed and exercised. Not all people get the same chance to cultivate and re ne their abilities. Whether or not they have such an opportunity will usually depend on their place within their society’s imagined hierarchy. Harry Potter is a good example. Removed from his distinguished wizard family and brought up by ignorant  muggles,  he  arrives  at  Hogwarts  without  any  experience  in  magic.  It takes him seven books to gain a  rm command of his powers and knowledge of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his unique abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, even if people belonging to di erent classes develop exactly the same abilities, they are unlikely to enjoy equal success because they will have to play the game by di erent rules. If, in British-ruled India, an Untouchable, a Brahmin, a Catholic Irishman and a Protestant Englishman had somehow developed exactly the  same  business  acumen,  they  still  would  not  have  had  the  same  chance  of becoming rich. The economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and uno cial glass ceilings. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>The Vicious Circle</p>
<p class="calibre1">All societies are based on imagined hierarchies, but not necessarily on the same hierarchies. What accounts for the di erences? Why did traditional Indian society classify  people  according  to  caste,  Ottoman  society  according  to  religion,  and American society according to race? In most cases the hierarchy originated as the result of a set of accidental historical circumstances and was then perpetuated and refined over many generations as different groups developed vested interests in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  instance,  many  scholars  surmise  that  the  Hindu  caste  system  took  shape when Indo-Aryan people invaded the Indian subcontinent about 3,000 years ago, subjugating the local population. The invaders established a strati ed society, in which  they  –  of  course  –  occupied  the  leading  positions  (priests  and  warriors), leaving the natives to live as servants and slaves. The invaders, who were few in number, feared losing their privileged status and unique identity. To forestall this danger,  they  divided  the  population  into  castes,  each  of  which  was  required  to pursue  a  speci c  occupation  or  perform  a  speci c  role  in  society.  Each  had di erent legal status, privileges and duties. Mixing of castes – social interaction, marriage, even the sharing of meals – was prohibited. And the distinctions were not just legal – they became an inherent part of religious mythology and practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rulers argued that the caste system re ected an eternal cosmic reality rather than  a  chance  historical  development.  Concepts  of  purity  and  impurity  were essential  elements  in  Hindu  religion,  and  they  were  harnessed  to  buttress  the social pyramid. Pious Hindus were taught that contact with members of a di erent caste could pollute not only them personally, but society as a whole, and should therefore  be  abhorred.  Such  ideas  are  hardly  unique  to  Hindus.  Throughout history, and in almost all societies, concepts of pollution and purity have played a leading role in enforcing social and political divisions and have been exploited by numerous ruling classes to maintain their privileges. The fear of pollution is not a complete fabrication of priests and princes, however. It probably has its roots in biological  survival  mechanisms  that  make  humans  feel  an  instinctive  revulsion towards  potential  disease  carriers,  such  as  sick  persons  and  dead  bodies.  If  you want to keep any human group isolated – women, Jews, Roma, gays, blacks – the best way to do it is convince everyone that these people are a source of pollution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Hindu  caste  system  and  its  attendant  laws  of  purity  became  deeply embedded  in  Indian  culture.  Long  after  the  Indo-Aryan  invasion  was  forgotten, Indians continued to believe in the caste system and to abhor the pollution caused by  caste  mixing.  Castes  were  not  immune  to  change.  In  fact,  as  time  went  by, large  castes  were  divided  into  sub-castes.  Eventually  the  original  four  castes turned  into  3,000  di erent  groupings  called  <i class="calibre4">jati</i>  (literally  ‘birth’).  But  this proliferation of castes did not change the basic principle of the system, according</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>to which every person is born into a particular rank, and any infringement of its rules  pollutes  the  person  and  society  as  a  whole.  A  persons  <i class="calibre4">jati</i>  determines  her profession, the food she can eat, her place of residence and her eligible marriage partners.  Usually  a  person  can  marry  only  within  his  or  her  caste,  and  the resulting children inherit that status. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever a new profession developed or a new group of people appeared on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  scene,  they  had  to  be  recognised  as  a  caste  in  order  to  receive  a  legitimate place within Hindu society. Groups that failed to win recognition as a caste were, literally, outcasts – in this strati ed society, they did not even occupy the lowest rung. They became known as Untouchables. They had to live apart from all other people and scrape together a living in humiliating and disgusting ways, such as sifting  through  garbage  dumps  for  scrap  material.  Even  members  of  the  lowest caste avoided mingling with them, eating with them, touching them and certainly marrying them. In modern India, matters of marriage and work are still heavily in uenced by the caste system, despite all attempts by the democratic government of India to break down such distinctions and convince Hindus that there is nothing polluting in caste mixing<a href="index_split_005.html#p357">.3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Purity in America</p>
<p class="calibre1">A similar vicious circle perpetuated the racial hierarchy in modern America. From the  sixteenth  to  the  eighteenth  century,  the  European  conquerors  imported millions  of  African  slaves  to  work  the  mines  and  plantations  of  America.  They chose to import slaves from Africa rather than from Europe or East Asia due to three circumstantial factors. Firstly, Africa was closer, so it was cheaper to import slaves from Senegal than from Vietnam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, in Africa there already existed a well-developed slave trade (exporting slaves mainly to the Middle East), whereas in Europe slavery was very rare. It was obviously far easier to buy slaves in an existing market than to create a new one from scratch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirdly, and most importantly, American plantations in places such as Virginia, Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever, which had originated in Africa. Africans had acquired over the generations a partial genetic immunity to these diseases, whereas Europeans were totally defenceless and died in droves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  consequently  wiser  for  a  plantation  owner  to  invest  his  money  in  an African  slave  than  in  a  European  slave  or  indentured  labourer.  Paradoxically, genetic  superiority  (in  terms  of  immunity)  translated  into  social  inferiority: precisely  because  Africans  were  tter  in  tropical  climates  than  Europeans,  they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>ended up as the slaves of European masters! Due to these circumstantial factors, the burgeoning new societies of America were to be divided into a ruling caste of white Europeans and a subjugated caste of black Africans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  people  don’t  like  to  say  that  they  keep  slaves  of  a  certain  race  or  origin simply  because  it’s  economically  expedient.  Like  the  Aryan  conquerors  of  India, white  Europeans  in  the  Americas  wanted  to  be  seen  not  only  as  economically successful but also as pious, just and objective. Religious and scienti c myths were pressed  into  service  to  justify  this  division.  Theologians  argued  that  Africans descend  from  Ham,  son  of  Noah,  saddled  by  his  father  with  a  curse  that  his o spring would be slaves. Biologists argued that blacks are less intelligent than whites  and  their  moral  sense  less  developed.  Doctors alleged  that  blacks  live  in filth and spread diseases – in other words, they are a source of pollution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  myths  struck  a  chord  in  American  culture,  and  in  Western  culture generally.  They  continued  to  exert  their  in uence  long  after  the  conditions  that created slavery had disappeared. In the early nineteenth century imperial Britain outlawed  slavery  and  stopped  the  Atlantic  slave  trade,  and  in  the  decades  that followed  slavery  was  gradually  outlawed  throughout  the  American  continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Notably,  this  was  the  rst  and  only  time  in  history  that  slaveholding  societies voluntarily  abolished  slavery.  But,  even  though  the  slaves  were  freed,  the  racist myths that justi ed slavery persisted. Separation of the races was maintained by racist legislation and social custom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  result  was  a  self-reinforcing  cycle  of  cause  and  e ect,  a  vicious  circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider, for example, the southern United States immediately after the Civil War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution outlawed slavery and the Fourteenth Amendment mandated that citizenship and the equal protection of the  law  could  not  be  denied  on  the  basis  of  race.  However,  two  centuries  of slavery meant that most black families were far poorer and far less educated than most white families. A black person born in Alabama in 1865 thus had much less chance  of  getting  a  good  education  and  a  well-paid  job  than  did  his  white neighbours. His children, born in the 1880S and 1890s, started life with the same disadvantage – they, too, were born to an uneducated, poor family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But economic disadvantage was not the whole story. Alabama was also home to many poor whites who lacked the opportunities available to their better-o  racial brothers  and  sisters.  In  addition,  the  Industrial  Revolution  and  the  waves  of immigration made the United States an extremely  uid society, where rags could quickly turn into riches. If money was all that mattered, the sharp divide between the races should soon have blurred, not least through intermarriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that did not happen. By 1865 whites, as well as many blacks, took it to be a simple matter of fact that blacks were less intelligent, more violent and sexually dissolute, lazier and less concerned about personal cleanliness than whites. They</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>were  thus  the  agents  of  violence,  theft,  rape  and  disease  –  in  other  words, pollution.  If  a  black Alabaman  in  1895  miraculously  managed  to  get  a  good education and then applied for a respectable job such as a bank teller, his odds of being accepted were far worse than those of an equally quali ed white candidate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stigma that labelled blacks as, by nature, unreliable, lazy and less intelligent conspired against him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  might  think  that  people  would  gradually  understand  that  these  stigmas were  myth  rather  than  fact  and  that  blacks  would  be  able,  over  time,  to  prove themselves  just  as  competent,  law-abiding  and  clean  as  whites.  In  fact,  the opposite happened – these prejudices became more and more entrenched as time went by. Since all the best jobs were held by whites, it became easier to believe that blacks really are inferior. ‘Look,’ said the average white citizen, ‘blacks have been  free  for  generations,  yet  there  are  almost  no  black  professors,  lawyers, doctors or even bank tellers. Isn’t that proof that blacks are simply less intelligent and hard-working?’ Trapped in this vicious circle, blacks were not hired for white-collar  jobs  because  they  were  deemed  unintelligent,  and  the  proof  of  their inferiority was the paucity of blacks in white-collar jobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vicious circle did not stop there. As anti-black stigmas grew stronger, they were translated into a system of ‘Jim Crow’ laws and norms that were meant to safeguard the racial order. Blacks were forbidden to vote in elections, to study in white schools, to buy in white stores, to eat in white restaurants, to sleep in white hotels.  The  justi cation  for  all  of  this  was  that  blacks  were  foul,  slothful  and vicious, so whites had to be protected from them. Whites did not want to sleep in the same hotel as blacks or to eat in the same restaurant, for fear of diseases. They did not want their children learning in the same school as black children, for fear of brutality and bad in uences. They did not want blacks voting in elections, since blacks  were  ignorant  and  immoral.  These  fears  were  substantiated  by  scienti c studies that ‘proved’ that blacks were indeed less educated, that various diseases were  more  common  among  them,  and  that  their  crime  rate  was  far  higher  (the studies  ignored  the  fact  that  these  ‘facts’  <i class="calibre4">resulted</i>  from  discrimination  against blacks). </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the mid-twentieth century, segregation in the former Confederate states was probably worse than in the late nineteenth century. Clennon King, a black student who applied to the University of Mississippi in 1958, was forcefully committed to a  mental  asylum.  The  presiding  judge  ruled  that  a  black  person  must  surely  be insane to think that he could be admitted to the University of Mississippi. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a><img src="index-126_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">The vicious circle: a chance histotical situation is translated into a rigid social system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing  was  as  revolting  to  American  southerners  (and  many  northerners)  as sexual relations and marriage between black men and white women. Sex between the races became the greatest taboo and any violation, or suspected violation, was viewed as deserving immediate and summary punishment in the form of lynching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Ku  Klux  Klan,  a  white  supremacist  secret  society,  perpetrated  many  such killings. They could have taught the Hindu Brahmins a thing or two about purity laws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  time,  the  racism  spread  to  more  and  more  cultural  arenas.  American aesthetic  culture  was  built  around  white  standards  of  beauty.  The  physical attributes of the white race – for example light skin, fair and straight hair, a small upturned nose – came to be identi ed as beautiful. Typical black features – dark skin,  dark  and  bushy  hair,  a  attened  nose  –  were  deemed  ugly.  These preconceptions  ingrained  the  imagined  hierarchy  at  an  even  deeper  level  of human consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such vicious circles can go on for centuries and even millennia, perpetuating an imagined  hierarchy  that  sprang  from  a  chance  historical  occurrence.  Unjust discrimination  often  gets  worse,  not  better,  with  time.  Money  comes  to  money, and  poverty  to  poverty.  Education  comes  to  education,  and  ignorance  to ignorance. Those once victimised by history are likely to be victimised yet again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And those whom history has privileged are more likely to be privileged again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  sociopolitical  hierarchies  lack  a  logical  or  biological  basis  –  they  are nothing  but  the  perpetuation  of  chance  events  supported  by  myths.  That  is  one good reason to study history. If the division into blacks and whites or Brahmins and Shudras was grounded in biological realities – that is, if Brahmins really had better brains than Shudras – biology would be su cient for understanding human society. Since the biological distinctions between di erent groups of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> are, in fact, negligible, biology can’t explain the intricacies of Indian society or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>American racial dynamics. We can only understand those phenomena by studying the  events,  circumstances,  and  power  relations  that  transformed  gments  of imagination into cruel – and very real – social structures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He and She</p>
<p class="calibre1">Di erent  societies  adopt  di erent  kinds  of  imagined  hierarchies.  Race  is  very important  to  modern  Americans  but  was  relatively  insigni cant  to  medieval Muslims.  Caste  was  a  matter  of  life  and  death  in  medieval  India,  whereas  in modern Europe it is practically non-existent. One hierarchy, however, has been of supreme  importance  in  all  known  human  societies:  the  hierarchy  of  gender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  everywhere  have  divided  themselves  into  men  and  women.  And  almost everywhere  men  have  got  the  better  deal,  at  least  since  the  Agricultural Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the earliest Chinese texts are oracle bones, dating to 1200 BC, used to divine  the  future.  On  one  was  engraved  the  question:  ‘Will  Lady  Hao’s childbearing be lucky?’ To which was written the reply: ‘If the child is born on a <i class="calibre4">ding</i> day, lucky; if on a  <i class="calibre4">geng</i> day, vastly auspicious.’ However, Lady Hao was to give birth on a  <i class="calibre4">jiayin</i> day. The text ends with the morose observation: ‘Three weeks and  one  day  later,  on  <i class="calibre4">jiayin</i>  day,  the  child  was  born.  Not  lucky.  It  was  a  girl.’<a href="index_split_005.html#p357">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  3,000  years  later,  when  Communist  China  enacted  the  ‘one  child’</p>
<p class="calibre1">policy,  many  Chinese  families  continued  to  regard  the  birth  of  a  girl  as  a misfortune. Parents would occasionally abandon or murder newborn baby girls in order to have another shot at getting a boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  many  societies  women  were  simply  the  property  of  men,  most  often  their fathers, husbands or brothers. Rape, in many legal systems, falls under property violation – in other words, the victim is not the woman who was raped but the male  who  owns  her.  This  being  the  case,  the  legal  remedy  was  the  transfer  of ownership – the rapist was required to pay a bride price to the woman’s father or brother, upon which she became the rapist’s property. The Bible decrees that ‘If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they  are  found,  then  the  man  who  lay  with  her  shall  give  to  the  father  of  the young  woman  fty  shekels  of  silver,  and  she  shall  be  his  wife’  (Deuteronomy 22:28–9). The ancient Hebrews considered this a reasonable arrangement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raping a woman who did not belong to any man was not considered a crime at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, just as picking up a lost coin on a busy street is not considered theft. And if a husband raped his own wife, he had committed no crime. In fact, the idea that a husband could rape his wife was an oxymoron. To be a husband was to have full</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>control  of  your  wife’s  sexuality.  To  say  that  a  husband  ‘raped’  his  wife  was  as illogical as saying that a man stole his own wallet. Such thinking was not confined to the ancient Middle East. As of 2006, there were still  fty-three countries where a husband could not be prosecuted for the rape of his wife. Even in Germany, rape laws were amended only in 1997 to create a legal category of marital rape. <a href="index_split_005.html#p357">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Is the division into men and women a product of the imagination, like the caste system in India and the racial system in America, or is it a natural division with deep  biological  roots?  And  if  it  is  indeed  a  natural  division,  are  there  also biological explanations for the preference given to men over women? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  of  the  cultural,  legal  and  political  disparities  between  men  and  women re ect  the  obvious  biological  di erences  between  the  sexes.  Childbearing  has always been women’s job, because men don’t have wombs. Yet around this hard universal kernel, every society accumulated layer upon layer of cultural ideas and norms that have little to do with biology. Societies associate a host of attributes with  masculinity  and  femininity  that,  for  the  most  part,  lack  a  rm  biological basis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  instance,  in  democratic  Athens  of  the  fth  century BC,  an  individual possessing  a  womb  had  no  independent  legal  status  and  was  forbidden  to participate in popular assemblies or to be a judge. With few exceptions, such an individual could not bene t from a good education, nor engage in business or in philosophical  discourse.  None  of  Athens’  political  leaders,  none  of  its  great philosophers,  orators,  artists  or  merchants  had  a  womb.  Does  having  a  womb make  a  person  un t,  biologically,  for  these  professions?  The  ancient  Athenians thought so. Modern Athenians disagree. In present-day Athens, women vote, are elected  to  public  o ce,  make  speeches,  design  everything  from  jewellery  to buildings to software, and go to university. Their wombs do not keep them from doing  any  of  these  things  as  successfully  as  men  do.  True,  they  are  still  under-represented in politics and business – only about 12 per cent of the members of Greece’s parliament are women. But there is no legal barrier to their participation in politics, and most modern Greeks think it is quite normal for a woman to serve in public office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many modern Greeks also think that an integral part of being a man is being sexually attracted to women only, and having sexual relations exclusively with the opposite  sex.  They  don’t  see  this  as  a  cultural  bias,  but  rather  as  a  biological reality  –  relations  between  two  people  of  the  opposite  sex  are  natural,  and between  two  people  of  the  same  sex  unnatural.  In  fact,  though,  Mother  Nature does  not  mind  if  men  are  sexually  attracted  to  one  another.  It’s  only  human mothers steeped in particular cultures who make a scene if their son has a  ing with the boy next door. The mother’s tantrums are not a biological imperative. A signi cant  number  of  human  cultures  have  viewed  homosexual  relations  as  not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>only  legitimate  but  even  socially  constructive,  ancient  Greece  being  the  most notable example. The  <i class="calibre4">Iliad</i> does not mention that Thetis had any objection to her son Achilles’ relations with Patroclus. Queen Olympias of Macedon was one of the most temperamental and forceful women of the ancient world, and even had her own husband, King Philip, assassinated. Yet she didn’t have a  t when her son, Alexander the Great, brought his lover Hephaestion home for dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  can  we  distinguish  what  is  biologically  determined  from  what  people merely  try  to  justify  through  biological  myths?  A  good  rule of thumb is ‘Biology enables,  Culture  forbids.’  Biology  is  willing  to  tolerate  a  very  wide  spectrum  of possibilities.  It’s  culture  that  obliges  people  to  realise  some  possibilities  while forbidding others. Biology enables women to have children – some cultures oblige women  to  realise  this  possibility.  Biology  enables  men  to  enjoy  sex  with  one another – some cultures forbid them to realise this possibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by de nition also  natural.  A  truly  unnatural  behaviour,  one  that  goes  against  the  laws  of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from  Christian  theology.  The  theological  meaning  of  ‘natural’  is  ‘in  accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature’. Christian theologians argued that  God  created  the  human  body,  intending  each  limb  and  organ  to  serve  a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by God,  then  it  is  a  natural  activity.  To  use  them  di erently  than  God  intends  is unnatural.  But  evolution  has  no  purpose.  Organs  have  not  evolved  with  a purpose, and the way they are used is in constant  ux. There is not a single organ in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it  rst appeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function, but  once  they  exist,  they  can  be  adapted  for  other  usages  as  well.  Mouths,  for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors 600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarly,  wings  didn’t  suddenly  appear  in  all  their  aerodynamic  glory.  They developed  from  organs  that  served  another  purpose.  According  to  one  theory, insect  wings  evolved  millions  of  years  ago  from  body  protrusions  on  ightless bugs. Bugs with bumps had a larger surface area than those without bumps, and this  enabled  them to  absorb  more  sunlight  and  thus  stay  warmer.  In  a  slow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>evolutionary process, these solar heaters grew larger. The same structure that was good for maximum sunlight absorption – lots of surface area, little weight – also, by  coincidence,  gave  the  insects  a  bit  of  a  lift  when  they  skipped  and  jumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those with bigger protrusions could skip and jump farther. Some insects started using the things to glide, and from there it was a small step to wings that could actually propel the bug through the air. Next time a mosquito buzzes in your ear, accuse  her  of  unnatural  behaviour.  If  she  were  well  behaved  and  content  with what God gave her, she’d use her wings only as solar panels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same sort of multitasking applies to our sexual organs and behaviour. Sex rst evolved for procreation and courtship rituals as a way of sizing up the  tness of  a  potential  mate.  But  many  animals  now  put  both  to  use  for  a  multitude  of social  purposes  that  have  little  to  do  with  creating  little  copies  of  themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chimpanzees, for example, use sex to cement political alliances, establish intimacy and defuse tensions. Is that unnatural? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sex and Gender</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is little sense, then, in arguing that the natural function of women is to give birth,  or  that  homosexuality  is  unnatural.  Most  of  the  laws,  norms,  rights  and obligations  that  de ne  manhood  and  womanhood  re ect  human  imagination more than biological reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Biologically, humans are divided into males and females. A male  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> is one who has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome; a female is one with</p>
<p class="calibre1">two Xs. But ‘man’ and woman’ name social, not biological, categories. While in the great majority of cases in most human societies men are males and women are females, the social terms carry a lot of baggage that has only a tenuous, if any, relationship  to  the  biological  terms.  A  man  is  not  a  Sapiens  with  particular biological  qualities  such  as  XY  chromosomes,  testicles  and  lots  of  testosterone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather,  he  ts  into  a  particular  slot  in  his  society’s  imagined  human  order.  His culture’s myths assign him particular masculine roles (like engaging in politics), rights (like voting) and duties (like military service). Likewise, a woman is not a Sapiens with two X chromosomes, a womb and plenty of oestrogen. Rather, she is a female member of an imagined human order. The myths of her society assign her unique feminine roles (raising children), rights (protection against violence) and duties (obedience to her husband). Since myths, rather than biology, de ne the  roles,  rights  and  duties  of  men  and  women,  the  meaning  of  ‘manhood’  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘womanhood’ have varied immensely from one society to another. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Throughout the animal kingdom males tend to be more colourful and accessorised than females – think</b> <b class="calibre3">of peacocks’ tails and lions’ manes</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To make things less confusing, scholars usually distinguish between ‘sex’, which is a biological category, and ‘gender’, a cultural category. Sex is divided between males  and  females,  and  the  qualities  of  this  division  are  objective  and  have remained constant throughout history. Gender is divided between men and women (and  some  cultures  recognise  other  categories).  So-called  ‘masculine’  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘feminine’  qualities  are  inter-subjective  and  undergo  constant  changes.  For</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>example,  there  are  far-reaching  di erences  in  the  behaviour,  desires,  dress  and even  body  posture  expected  from  women  in  classical  Athens  and  women  in modern Athens. <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sex is child’s play; but gender is serious business. To get to be a member of the male sex is the simplest thing in the world. You just need to be born with an X and a Y chromosome. To get to be a female is equally simple. A pair of X chromosomes will  do  it.  In  contrast,  becoming  a  man  or  a  woman  is  a  very  complicated  and demanding undertaking. Since most masculine and feminine qualities are cultural rather than biological, no society automatically crowns each male a man, or every female a woman. Nor are these titles laurels that can be rested on once they are acquired.  Males  must  prove  their  masculinity  constantly,  throughout  their  lives, from  cradle  to  grave,  in  an  endless  series  of  rites  and  performances.  And  a woman’s work is never done – she must continually convince herself and others that she is feminine enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Success is not guaranteed. Males in particular live in constant dread of losing their claim to manhood. Throughout history, males have been willing to risk and even sacrifice their lives, just so that people will say ‘He’s a real man!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">What’s So Good About Men? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  least  since  the  Agricultural  Revolution,  most  human  societies  have  been patriarchal societies that valued men more highly than women. No matter how a society  de ned  ‘man’  and  ‘woman’,  to  be  a  man  was  always  better.  Patriarchal societies educate men to think and act in a masculine way and women to think and act in a feminine way, punishing anyone who dares cross those boundaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet they do not equally reward those who conform. Qualities considered masculine are more valued than those considered feminine, and members of a society who personify  the  feminine  ideal  get  less  than  those  who  exemplify  the  masculine ideal. Fewer resources are invested in the health and education of women; they have  fewer  economic  opportunities,  less  political  power,  and  less  freedom  of movement. Gender is a race in which some of the runners compete only for the bronze medal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True, a handful of women have made it to the alpha position, such as Cleopatra of Egypt, Empress Wu Zetian of China ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>. AD 700) and Elizabeth I of England. Yet they are the exceptions that prove the rule. Throughout Elizabeth’s forty- ve-year reign,  all  Members  of  Parliament  were  men,  all  o cers  in  the  Royal  Navy  and army  were  men,  all  judges  and  lawyers  were  men,  all  bishops  and  archbishops were  men,  all  theologians  and  priests  were  men,  all  doctors  and  surgeons  were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>men,  all  students  and  professors  in  all  universities  and  colleges  were  men,  all mayors  and  sheri s  were  men,  and  almost  all  the  writers,  architects,  poets, philosophers, painters, musicians and scientists were men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patriarchy has been the norm in almost all agricultural and industrial societies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has tenaciously weathered political upheavals, social revolutions and economic transformations.  Egypt,  for  example,  was  conquered  numerous  times  over  the centuries. Assyrians, Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Arabs, Mameluks, Turks and British  occupied  it  –  and  its  society  always  remained  patriarchal.  Egypt  was governed  by  pharaonic  law,  Greek  law,  Roman  law,  Muslim  law,  Ottoman  law and  British  law  –  and  they  all  discriminated  against  people  who  were  not  ‘real men’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since patriarchy is so universal, it cannot be the product of some vicious circle that  was  kick-started  by  a  chance  occurrence.  It  is  particularly  noteworthy  that even before 1492, most societies in both America and Afro-Asia were patriarchal, even though they had been out of contact for thousands of years. If patriarchy in Afro-Asia resulted from some chance occurrence, why were the Aztecs and Incas patriarchal? It is far more likely that even though the precise de nition of ‘man’</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  ‘woman’  varies  between  cultures,  there  is  some  universal  biological  reason why almost all cultures valued manhood over womanhood. We do not know what</p>
<p class="calibre1">this reason is. There are plenty of theories, none of them convincing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muscle Power</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most common theory points to the fact that men are stronger than women, and  that  they  have  used  their  greater  physical  power  to  force  women  into submission. A more subtle version of this claim argues that their strength allows men to monopolise tasks that demand hard manual labour, such as ploughing and harvesting.  This  gives  them  control  of  food  production,  which  in  turn  translates into political clout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  are  two  problems  with  this  emphasis  on  muscle  power.  First,  the statement that men are stronger than women’ is true only on average, and only with regard to certain types of strength. Women are generally more resistant to hunger, disease and fatigue than men. There are also many women who can run faster  and  lift  heavier  weights  than  many  men.  Furthermore,  and  most problematically  for  this  theory,  women  have,  throughout  history,  been  excluded mainly from jobs that require little physical e ort (such as the priesthood, law and politics), while engaging in hard manual labour in the  elds, in crafts and in the household. If social power were divided in direct relation to physical strength or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>stamina, women should have got far more of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  more  importantly,  there  simply  is  no  direct  relation  between  physical strength and social power among humans. People in their sixties usually exercise power  over  people  in  their  twenties,  even  though  twentysomethings  are  much stronger than their elders. The typical plantation owner in Alabama in the mid-nineteenth century could have been wrestled to the ground in seconds by any of the  slaves  cultivating  his  cotton  elds.  Boxing  matches  were  not  used  to  select Egyptian  pharaohs  or  Catholic  popes.  In  forager  societies,  political  dominance generally resides with the person possessing the best social skills rather than the most  developed  musculature.  In  organised  crime,  the  big  boss  is  not  necessarily the strongest man. He is often an older man who very rarely uses his own  sts; he gets younger and  tter men to do the dirty jobs for him. A guy who thinks that the way  to  take  over  the  syndicate  is  to  beat  up  the  don  is  unlikely  to  live  long enough to learn from his mistake. Even among chimpanzees, the alpha male wins his  position  by  building  a  stable  coalition  with  other  males  and  females,  not through mindless violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  human  history  shows  that  there  is  often  an  inverse  relation  between physical prowess and social power. In most societies, it’s the lower classes who do the manual labour. This may re ect  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> position in the food chain. If all that counted were raw physical abilities, Sapiens would have found themselves on a middle rung of the ladder. But their mental and social skills placed them at the top. It is therefore only natural that the chain of power within the species will also be  determined  by  mental  and  social  abilities  more  than  by  brute  force.  It  is therefore hard to believe that the most in uential and most stable social hierarchy in history is founded on men’s ability physically to coerce women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Scum of Society</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another theory explains that masculine dominance results not from strength but from aggression. Millions of years of evolution have made men far more violent than  women.  Women  can  match  men  as  far  as  hatred,  greed  and  abuse  are concerned, but when push comes to shove, the theory goes, men are more willing to  engage  in  raw  physical  violence.  This  is  why  throughout  history  warfare  has been a masculine prerogative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In times of war, men’s control of the armed forces has made them the masters of civilian society, too. They then used their control of civilian society to  ght more and more wars, and the greater the number of wars, the greater men’s control of society. This feedback loop explains both the ubiquity of war and the ubiquity of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>patriarchy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recent  studies  of  the  hormonal  and  cognitive  systems  of  men  and  women strengthen  the  assumption  that  men  indeed  have  more  aggressive  and  violent tendencies,  and  are  therefore,  on  average,  better  suited  to  serve  as  common soldiers. Yet granted that the common soldiers are all men, does it follow that the ones managing the war and enjoying its fruits must also be men? That makes no sense.  It’s  like  assuming  that  because  all  the  slaves  cultivating  cotton  elds  are black,  plantation  owners  will  be  black  as  well.  Just  as  an  all-black  workforce might  be  controlled  by  an  all-white  management,  why  couldn’t  an  all-male soldiery be controlled by an all-female or at least partly female government? In fact, in numerous societies throughout history, the top o cers did not work their way up from the rank of private. Aristocrats, the wealthy and the educated were automatically assigned officer rank and never served a day in the ranks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Duke of Wellington, Napoleon’s nemesis, enlisted in the British army at the age of eighteen, he was immediately commissioned as an o cer. He didn’t think much of the plebeians under his command. ‘We have in the service the scum of the earth as common soldiers,’ he wrote to a fellow aristocrat during the wars against  France.  These  common  soldiers  were  usually  recruited  from  among  the very poorest, or from ethnic minorities (such as the Irish Catholics). Their chances of ascending the military ranks were negligible. The senior ranks were reserved for dukes, princes and kings. But why only for dukes, and not for duchesses? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  French  Empire  in  Africa  was  established  and  defended  by  the  sweat  and blood of Senegalese, Algerians and working-class Frenchmen. The percentage of well-born Frenchmen within the ranks was negligible. Yet the percentage of well-born Frenchmen within the small elite that led the French army, ruled the empire and  enjoyed  its  fruits  was  very  high.  Why  just  Frenchmen,  and  not  French women? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  China  there  was  a  long  tradition  of  subjugating  the  army  to  the  civilian bureaucracy, so mandarins who had never held a sword often ran the wars. ‘You do not waste good iron to make nails,’ went a common Chinese saying, meaning that really talented people join the civil bureaucracy, not the army. Why, then, were all of these mandarins men? </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  can’t  reasonably  argue  that  their  physical  weakness  or  low  testosterone levels  prevented  women  from  being  successful  mandarins,  generals  and politicians.  In  order  to  manage  a  war,  you  surely  need  stamina,  but  not  much physical  strength  or  aggressiveness.  Wars  are  not  a  pub  brawl.  They  are  very complex  projects that  require  an  extraordinary  degree  of  organisation, cooperation  and  appeasement.  The  ability  to  maintain  peace  at  home,  acquire allies  abroad,  and  understand  what  goes  through  the  minds  of  other  people (particularly  your  enemies)  is  usually  the  key  to  victory.  Hence  an  aggressive</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>brute is often the worst choice to run a war. Much better is a cooperative person who  knows  how  to  appease,  how  to  manipulate  and  how  to  see  things  from di erent perspectives. This is the stu  empire-builders are made of. The militarily incompetent  Augustus  succeeded  in  establishing  a  stable  imperial  regime, achieving something that eluded both Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great, who were  much  better  generals.  Both  his  admiring  contemporaries  and  modern historians  often  attribute  this  feat  to  his  virtue  of  <i class="calibre4">clementia  –</i>  mildness  and clemency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Women are often stereotyped as better manipulators and appeasers than men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  are  famed  for  their  superior  ability  to  see  things  from  the  perspective  of others.  If  there’s  any  truth  in  these  stereotypes,  then  women  should  have  made excellent politicians and empire-builders, leaving the dirty work on the battlefields to  testosterone-charged  but  simple-minded  machos.  Popular  myths</p>
<p class="calibre1">notwithstanding, this rarely happened in the real world. It is not at all clear why not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patriarchal Genes</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  third  type  of  biological  explanation  gives  less  importance  to  brute  force  and violence,  and  suggests  that  through  millions  of  years  of  evolution,  men  and women evolved di erent survival and reproduction strategies. As men competed against  each  other  for  the  opportunity  to  impregnate  fertile  women,  an individual’s  chances  of  reproduction  depended  above  all  on  his  ability  to outperform  and  defeat  other  men.  As  time  went  by,  the  masculine  genes  that made  it  to  the  next  generation  were  those  belonging  to  the  most  ambitious, aggressive and competitive men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  woman,  on  the  other  hand,  had  no  problem  nding  a  man  willing  to impregnate  her.  However,  if  she  wanted  her  children  to  provide  her  with grandchildren, she needed to carry them in her womb for nine arduous months, and then nurture them for years. During that time she had fewer opportunities to obtain food, and required a lot of help. She needed a man. In order to ensure her own survival and the survival of her children, the woman had little choice but to agree  to  whatever  conditions  the  man  stipulated  so  that  he  would  stick  around and share some of the burden. As time went by, the feminine genes that made it to the next generation belonged to women who were submissive caretakers. Women who spent too much time  ghting for power did not leave any of those powerful genes for future generations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The result of these di erent survival strategies – so the theory goes – is that men</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>have been programmed to be ambitious and competitive, and to excel in politics and business, whereas women have tended to move out of the way and dedicate their lives to raising children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this approach also seems to be belied by the empirical evidence. Particularly problematic  is  the  assumption  that  women’s  dependence  on  external  help  made them  dependent  on  men,  rather  than  on  other  women,  and  that  male competitiveness made men socially dominant. There are many species of animals, such  as  elephants  and  bonobo  chimpanzees,  in  which  the  dynamics  between dependent  females  and  competitive  males  results  in  a  <i class="calibre4">matriarchal</i>  society.  Since females  need  external  help,  they  are  obliged  to  develop  their  social  skills  and learn  how  to  cooperate  and  appease.  They  construct  all-female  social  networks that  help  each  member  raise  her  children.  Males,  meanwhile,  spend  their  time ghting  and  competing.  Their  social  skills  and  social  bonds  remain</p>
<p class="calibre1">underdeveloped. Bonobo and elephant societies are controlled by strong networks of cooperative females, while the self-centred and uncooperative males are pushed to the sidelines. Though bonobo females are weaker on average than the males, the females often gang up to beat males who overstep their limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If this is possible among bonobos and elephants, why not among  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sapiens  are  relatively  weak  animals,  whose  advantage  rests  in  their  ability  to cooperate in large numbers. If so, we should expect that dependent women, even if they are dependent on men, would use their superior social skills to cooperate to outmanoeuvre and manipulate aggressive, autonomous and self-centred men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation,  individuals  who  are  supposedly  less  cooperative  (men)  control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">species  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  are  characterised  not  by  physical  strength, aggressiveness  and  competitiveness,  but  rather  by  superior  social  skills  and  a greater tendency to cooperate. We just don’t know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What we do know, however, is that during the last century gender roles have undergone a tremendous revolution. More and more societies today not only give men  and  women  equal  legal  status,  political  rights  and  economic  opportunities, but also completely rethink their most basic conceptions of gender and sexuality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though  the  gender  gap  is  still  signi cant,  events  have  been  moving  at  a breathtaking speed. At the beginning of the twentieth century the idea of giving voting rights to women was generally seen in the USA as outrageous; the prospect of  a  female  cabinet  secretary  or  Supreme  Court  justice  was  simply  ridiculous; whereas homosexuality was such a taboo subject that it could not even be openly discussed. At the beginning of the twenty- rst century women’s voting rights are taken for granted; female cabinet secretaries are hardly a cause for comment; and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>in 2013  ve US Supreme Court justices, three of them women, decided in favour of legalising same-sex marriages (overruling the objections of four male justices). </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  dramatic  changes  are  precisely  what  makes  the  history  of  gender  so bewildering. If, as is being demonstrated today so clearly, the patriarchal system has been based on unfounded myths rather than on biological facts, what accounts for the universality and stability of this system? </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Arrow of History</p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION, human societies grew ever larger and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  complex,  while  the  imagined  constructs  sustaining  the  social  order  also became  more  elaborate.  Myths  and  ctions  accustomed  people,  nearly  from  the moment of birth, to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain standards,  to  want  certain  things,  and  to  observe  certain  rules.  They  thereby created  arti cial  instincts  that  enabled  millions  of  strangers  to  cooperate effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called culture’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the  rst half of the twentieth century, scholars taught that every culture was complete and harmonious, possessing an unchanging essence that de ned it for all time. Each human group had its own world view and system of social, legal and political arrangements that ran as smoothly as the planets going around the sun. In this view, cultures left to their own devices did not change. They just kept going  at  the  same  pace  and  in  the  same  direction.  Only  a  force  applied  from outside  could  change  them.  Anthropologists,  historians  and  politicians  thus referred to ‘Samoan Culture’ or ‘Tasmanian Culture’ as if the same beliefs, norms and values had characterised Samoans and Tasmanians from time immemorial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, most scholars of culture have concluded that the opposite is true. Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in constant  ux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes in its environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures. But cultures also undergo transitions due to their own internal dynamics. Even a completely isolated culture existing in an ecologically stable environment cannot avoid change. Unlike the laws of physics, which are free of inconsistencies, every man-made order is packed with internal contradictions.  Cultures  are  constantly  trying  to  reconcile  these  contradictions, and this process fuels change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For instance, in medieval Europe the nobility believed in both Christianity and chivalry. A typical nobleman went to church in the morning, and listened as the priest held forth on the lives of the saints. ‘Vanity of vanities,’ said the priest, ‘all is vanity. Riches, lust and honour are dangerous temptations. You must rise above them,  and  follow  in  Christ’s  footsteps.  Be  meek  like  Him,  avoid  violence  and extravagance, and if attacked – just turn the other cheek.’ Returning home in a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>meek and pensive mood, the nobleman would change into his best silks and go to a banquet in his lord’s castle. There the wine  owed like water, the minstrel sang of Lancelot and Guinevere, and the guests exchanged dirty jokes and bloody war tales. ‘It is better to die,’ declared the barons, ‘than to live with shame. If someone questions your honour, only blood can wipe out the insult. And what is better in life than to see your enemies flee before you, and their pretty daughters tremble at your feet?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The contradiction was never fully resolved. But as the European nobility, clergy and commoners grappled with it, their culture changed. One attempt to  gure it out produced the Crusades. On crusade, knights could demonstrate their military prowess  and  their  religious  devotion  at  one  stroke.  The  same  contradiction produced military orders such as the Templars and Hospitallers, who tried to mesh Christian and chivalric ideals even more tightly. It was also responsible for a large part of medieval art and literature, such as the tales of King Arthur and the Holy Grail.  What  was  Camelot  but  an  attempt  to  prove  that  a  good  knight  can  and should be a good Christian, and that good Christians make the best knights? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  example  is  the  modern  political  order.  Ever  since  the  French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better  o .  Guaranteeing  that  every  individual  will  be  free  to  do  as  he  wishes inevitably  short-changes  equality.  The  entire  political  history  of  the  world  since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyone who has read a novel by Charles Dickens knows that the liberal regimes of nineteenth-century Europe gave priority to individual freedom even if it meant throwing insolvent poor families in prison and giving orphans little choice but to join  schools  for  pickpockets.  Anyone  who  has  read  a  novel  by  Alexander Solzhenitsyn knows how Communisms egalitarian ideal produced brutal tyrannies that tried to control every aspect of daily life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contemporary  American  politics  also  revolve  around  this  contradiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Democrats want a more equitable society, even if it means raising taxes to fund programmes  to  help  the  poor,  elderly  and  in rm.  But  that  infringes  on  the freedom  of  individuals  to  spend  their  money  as  they  wish.  Why  should  the government force me to buy health insurance if I prefer using the money to put my  kids  through  college?  Republicans,  on  the  other  hand,  want  to  maximise individual freedom, even if it means that the income gap between rich and poor will grow wider and that many Americans will not be able to afford health care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. But this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>culture’s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. Just as  when  two  clashing  musical  notes  played  together  force  a  piece  of  music forward,  so  discord  in  our  thoughts,  ideas  and  values  compel  us  to  think, reevaluate and criticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If tensions, con icts and irresolvable dilemmas are the spice of every culture, a human being who belongs to any particular culture must hold contradictory beliefs and be riven by incompatible values. It’s such an essential feature of any culture that  it  even  has  a  name:  cognitive  dissonance.  Cognitive  dissonance  is  often considered a failure of the human psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset. Had people been unable to hold contradictory beliefs and values, it would probably have been impossible to establish and maintain any human culture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If,  say,  a  Christian  really  wants  to  understand  the  Muslims  who attend  that mosque down the street, he shouldn’t look for a pristine set of values that every Muslim holds dear. Rather, he should enquire into the catch-22s of Muslim culture, those  places  where  rules  are  at  war  and  standards  scu e.  It’s  at  the  very  spot where  the  Muslims  teeter  between  two  imperatives  that  you’ll  understand  them best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spy Satel ite</p>
<p class="calibre1">Human  cultures  are  in  constant  ux.  Is  this  ux  completely  random,  or  does  it have some overall pattern? In other words, does history have a direction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The answer is yes. Over the millennia, small, simple cultures gradually coalesce into bigger and more complex civilisations, so that the world contains fewer and fewer mega-cultures, each of which is bigger and more complex. This is of course a very crude generalisation, true only at the macro level. At the micro level, it seems that for every group of cultures that coalesces into a mega-culture, there’s a mega-culture that breaks up into pieces. The Mongol Empire expanded to dominate a huge  swathe  of  Asia  and  even  parts  of  Europe,  only  to  shatter  into  fragments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christianity  converted  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  at  the  same  time  that  it splintered into innumerable sects. The Latin language spread through western and central  Europe,  then  split  into  local  dialects  that  themselves  eventually  became national languages. But these break-ups are temporary reversals in an inexorable trend towards unity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perceiving the direction of history is really a question of vantage point. When we adopt the proverbial bird’s-eye view of history, which examines developments in  terms  of  decades  or  centuries,  it’s  hard  to  say  whether  history  moves  in  the direction of unity or of diversity. However, to understand long-term processes the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>bird’s-eye view is too myopic. We would do better to adopt instead the viewpoint of a cosmic spy satellite, which scans millennia rather than centuries. From such a vantage point it becomes crystal clear that history is moving relentlessly towards unity. The sectioning of Christianity and the collapse of the Mongol Empire are just speed bumps on history’s highway. </p>
