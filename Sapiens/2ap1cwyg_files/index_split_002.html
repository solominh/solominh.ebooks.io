<p class="calibre1">The best way to appreciate the general direction of history is to count the number of separate human worlds that coexisted at any given moment on planet Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, we are used to thinking about the whole planet as a single unit, but for most of history, earth was in fact an entire galaxy of isolated human worlds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider Tasmania, a medium-sized island south of Australia. It was cut off from the Australian mainland in about 10,000 BC as the end of the Ice Age caused the sea level to rise. A few thousand hunter-gatherers were left on the island, and had no  contact  with  any  other  humans  until  the  arrival  of  the  Europeans  in  the nineteenth  century.  For  12,000  years,  nobody  else  knew  the  Tasmanians  were there,  and  they  didn’t  know  that  there  was  anyone  else  in  the  world.  They  had their wars, political struggles, social oscillations and cultural developments. Yet as far  as  the  emperors  of  China  or  the  rulers  of  Mesopotamia  were  concerned, Tasmania  could  just  as  well  have  been  located  on  one  of  Jupiter’s  moons.  The Tasmanians lived in a world of their own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">America and Europe, too, were separate worlds for most of their histories. In AD</p>
<p class="calibre1">378,  the  Roman  emperor  Valence  was  defeated  and  killed  by  the  Goths  at  the battle  of  Adrianople.  In  the  same  year,  King  Chak  Tok  Ich’aak  of  Tikal  was defeated and killed by the army of Teotihuacan. (Tikal was an important Mayan city  state,  while  Teotihuacan  was  then  the  largest  city  in  America,  with  almost 250,000 inhabitants – of the same order of magnitude as its contemporary, Rome.) There was absolutely no connection between the defeat of Rome and the rise of Teotihuacan.  Rome  might  just  as  well  have  been  located  on  Mars,  and Teotihuacan on Venus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  many  di erent  human  worlds  coexisted  on  earth?  Around  10.000 BC  our planet  contained  many  thousands  of  them.  By  2000 BC,  their  numbers  had dwindled to the hundreds, or at most a few thousand. By AD 1450, their numbers had declined even more drastically. At that time, just prior to the age of European exploration,  earth  still  contained  a  signi cant  number  of  dwarf  worlds  such  as Tasmania. But close to 90 per cent of humans lived in a single mega-world: the world of Afro-Asia. Most of Asia, most of Europe, and most of Africa (including substantial  chunks  of  sub-Saharan  Africa)  were  already  connected  by  signi cant</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>cultural, political and economic ties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of  the  remaining  tenth  of  the  world’s  human  population  was  divided between four worlds of considerable size and complexity:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1</b>.  The  Mesoamerican  World,  which  encompassed  most  of  Central  America  and parts of North America. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2</b>. The Andean World, which encompassed most of western South America. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">3</b>. The Australian World, which encompassed the continent of Australia. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">4</b>.  The  Oceanic  World,  which  encompassed  most  of  the  islands  of  the  south-western Pacific Ocean, from Hawaii to New Zealand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the next 300 years, the Afro-Asian giant swallowed up all the other worlds. It consumed  the  Mesoamerican  World  in  1521,  when  the  Spanish  conquered  the Aztec  Empire.  It  took  its  rst  bite  out  of  the  Oceanic  World  at  the  same  time, during Ferdinand Magellan’s circumnavigation of the globe, and soon after that completed  its  conquest.  The  Andean  World  collapsed  in  1532,  when  Spanish conquistadors  crushed  the  Inca  Empire.  The  rst  European  landed  on  the Australian continent in 1606, and that pristine world came to an end when British colonisation began in earnest in 1788. Fifteen years later the Britons established their  rst settlement in Tasmania, thus bringing the last autonomous human world into the Afro-Asian sphere of influence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took the Afro-Asian giant several centuries to digest all that it had swallowed, but  the  process  was  irreversible.  Today  almost  all  humans  share  the  same geopolitical  system  (the  entire  planet  is  divided  into  internationally  recognised states);  the  same  economic  system  (capitalist  market  forces  shape  even  the remotest  corners  of  the  globe);  the  same  legal  system  (human  rights  and international  law  are  valid  everywhere,  at  least  theoretically);  and  the  same scienti c system (experts in Iran, Israel, Australia and Argentina have exactly the same views about the structure of atoms or the treatment of tuberculosis). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  single  global  culture  is  not  homogeneous.  Just  as  a  single  organic  body contains  many  di erent  kinds  of  organs  and  cells,  so  our  single  global  culture contains  many  di erent  types  of  lifestyles  and  people,  from  New  York stockbrokers  to  Afghan  shepherds.  Yet  they  are  all  closely  connected  and  they in uence one another in myriad ways. They still argue and  ght, but they argue using  the  same  concepts  and  ght  using  the  same  weapons.  A  real  ‘clash  of civilisations’ is like the proverbial dialogue of the deaf. Nobody can grasp what the other is saying. Today when Iran and the United States rattle swords at one another,  they  both  speak  the  language  of  nation  states,  capitalist  economies, international rights and nuclear physics. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a><img src="index-147_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Map 3. Earth in AD 1450. The named locations within the Afro-Asian World were places visited by the</b> <b class="calibre3">fourteenth-century Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta. A native of Tangier, in Morocco, Ibn Battuta visited</b> <b class="calibre3">Timbuktu, Zanzibar, southern Russia, Central Asia, India, China and Indonesia. His travels illustrate the</b> <b class="calibre3">unity of Afro-Asia on the eve of the modern era</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  still  talk  a  lot  about  ‘authentic’  cultures,  but  if  by  authentic’  we  mean something  that  developed  independently,  and  that  consists  of  ancient  local traditions free of external in uences, then there are no authentic cultures left on earth.  Over  the  last  few  centuries,  all  cultures  were  changed  almost  beyond recognition by a flood of global influences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most interesting examples of this globalisation is ‘ethnic’ cuisine. In an Italian restaurant we expect to  nd spaghetti in tomato sauce; in Polish and Irish  restaurants  lots  of  potatoes;  in  an  Argentinian  restaurant  we  can  choose between  dozens  of  kinds  of  beefsteaks;  in  an  Indian  restaurant  hot  chillies  are incorporated  into  just  about  everything;  and  the  highlight  at  any  Swiss  café  is thick  hot  chocolate  under  an  alp  of  whipped  cream.  But  none  of  these  foods  is native  to  those  nations.  Tomatoes,  chilli  peppers  and  cocoa  are  all  Mexican  in origin; they reached Europe and Asia only after the Spaniards conquered Mexico. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Julius  Caesar  and  Dante  Alighieri  never  twirled  tomato-drenched  spaghetti  on their  forks  (even  forks  hadn’t  been  invented  yet),  William  Tell  never  tasted chocolate,  and  Buddha  never  spiced  up  his  food  with  chilli.  Potatoes  reached Poland and Ireland no more than 400 years ago. The only steak you could obtain in Argentina in 1492 was from a llama. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollywood  lms  have  perpetuated  an  image  of  the  Plains  Indians  as  brave horsemen, courageously charging the wagons of European pioneers to protect the customs  of  their  ancestors.  However,  these  Native  American  horsemen  were  not the defenders of some ancient, authentic culture. Instead, they were the product of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a><img src="index-148_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">a major military and political revolution that swept the plains of western North America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a consequence of the arrival of European horses. In 1492 there were no horses in America. The culture of the nineteenth-century Sioux and Apache has many appealing features, but it was a modern culture – a result of global forces – much more than authentic’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Global Vision</p>
<p class="calibre1">From  a  practical  perspective,  the  most  important  stage  in  the  process  of  global uni cation  occurred  in  the  last  few  centuries,  when  empires  grew  and  trade intensi ed.  Ever-tightening  links  were  formed  between  the  people  of  Afro-Asia, America, Australia and Oceania. Thus Mexican chilli peppers made it into Indian food  and  Spanish  cattle  began  grazing  in  Argentina.  Yet  from  an  ideological perspective,  an  even  more  important  development  occurred  during  the  rst millennium BC,  when  the  idea  of  a  universal  order  took  root.  For  thousands  of years  previously,  history  was  already  moving  slowly  in  the  direction  of  global unity, but the idea of a universal order governing the entire world was still alien to most people. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">25. </b></a><b class="calibre3">Sioux chiefs (1905). Neither the Sioux nor any other Great Plains tribe had horses prior to 1492</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> evolved to think of people as divided into us and them. ‘Us’ was the group immediately around you, whoever you were, and ‘them’ was everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>else. In fact, no social animal is ever guided by the interests of the entire species to which it belongs. No chimpanzee cares about the interests of the chimpanzee species, no snail will lift a tentacle for the global snail community, no lion alpha male makes a bid for becoming the king of all lions, and at the entrance of no beehive can one find the slogan: ‘Worker bees of the world – unite!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  beginning  with  the  Cognitive  Revolution,  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  became  more  and more  exceptional  in  this  respect.  People  began  to  cooperate  on  a  regular  basis with  complete  strangers,  whom  they  imagined  as  ‘brothers’  or  ‘friends’.  Yet  this brotherhood  was  not  universal.  Somewhere  in  the  next  valley,  or  beyond  the mountain  range,  one  could  still  sense  ‘them’.  When  the  rst  pharaoh,  Menes, united  Egypt  around  3000 BC,  it  was  clear  to  the  Egyptians  that  Egypt  had a border,  and  beyond  the  border  lurked  ‘barbarians’.  The  barbarians  were  alien, threatening,  and  interesting  only  to  the  extent  that  they  had  land  or  natural resources  that  the  Egyptians  wanted.  All  the  imagined  orders  people  created tended to ignore a substantial part of humankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst millennium BC witnessed the appearance of three potentially universal orders, whose devotees could for the  rst time imagine the entire world and the entire human race as a single unit governed by a single set of laws. Everyone was</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘us’, at least potentially. There was no longer ‘them’. The  rst universal order to appear  was  economic:  the  monetary  order.  The  second  universal  order  was political: the imperial order. The third universal order was religious: the order of universal religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merchants,  conquerors  and  prophets  were  the  rst  people  who  managed  to transcend  the  binary  evolutionary  division,  ‘us  vs  them’,  and  to  foresee  the potential unity of humankind. For the merchants, the entire world was a single market  and  all  humans  were  potential  customers.  They  tried  to  establish  an economic  order  that  would  apply  to  all,  everywhere.  For  the  conquerors,  the entire world was a single empire and all humans were potential subjects, and for the prophets, the entire world held a single truth and all humans were potential believers.  They  too  tried  to  establish  an  order  that  would  be  applicable  for everyone everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the last three millennia, people made more and more ambitious attempts to realise that global vision. The next three chapters discuss how money, empires and  universal  religions  spread,  and  how  they  laid  the  foundation  of  the  united world  of  today.  We  begin  with  the  story  of  the  greatest  conqueror  in  history,  a conqueror  possessed  of  extreme  tolerance  and  adaptability,  thereby  turning people into ardent disciples. This conqueror is money. People who do not believe in  the  same  god  or  obey  the  same  king  are  more  than  willing  to  use  the  same money.  Osama  Bin  Laden,  for  all  his  hatred  of  American  culture,  American religion  and  American  politics,  was  very  fond  of  American  dollars.  How  did</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>money succeed where gods and kings failed? </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Scent of Money</p>
<p class="calibre1">IN 1519 HERNÁN CORTÉS AND HIS CONQUISTADORS invaded Mexico, hitherto</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  isolated  human  world.  The  Aztecs,  as  the  people  who  lived  there  called themselves, quickly noticed that the aliens showed an extraordinary interest in a certain  yellow  metal.  In  fact,  they  never  seemed  to  stop  talking  about  it.  The natives were not unfamiliar with gold – it was pretty and easy to work, so they used it to make jewellery and statues, and they occasionally used gold dust as a medium of exchange. But when an Aztec wanted to buy something, he generally paid in cocoa beans or bolts of cloth. The Spanish obsession with gold thus seemed inexplicable. What was so important about a metal that could not be eaten, drunk or  woven,  and  was  too  soft  to  use  for  tools  or  weapons?  When  the  natives questioned  Cortés  as  to  why  the  Spaniards  had  such  a  passion  for  gold,  the conquistador answered, ‘Because I and my companions suffer from a disease of the heart which can be cured only with gold.’<a href="index_split_005.html#p358">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Afro-Asian world from which the Spaniards came, the obsession for gold was  indeed  an  epidemic.  Even  the  bitterest  of  enemies  lusted  after  the  same useless yellow metal. Three centuries before the conquest of Mexico, the ancestors of  Cortés  and  his  army  waged  a  bloody  war  of  religion  against  the  Muslim kingdoms in Iberia and North Africa. The followers of Christ and the followers of Allah  killed  each  other  by  the  thousands,  devastated  elds  and  orchards,  and turned prosperous cities into smouldering ruins – all for the greater glory of Christ or Allah. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Christians gradually gained the upper hand, they marked their victories not  only  by  destroying  mosques  and  building  churches,but  also  by  issuing  new gold and silver coins bearing the sign of the cross and thanking God for His help in  combating  the  in dels.  Yet  alongside  the  new  currency,  the  victors  minted another  type  of  coin,  called  the  millares,  which  carried  a  somewhat  di erent message. These square coins made by the Christian conquerors were emblazoned with  owing  Arabic  script  that  declared:  ‘There  is  no  god  except  Allah,  and Muhammad is Allah’s messenger.’ Even the Catholic bishops of Melgueil and Agde issued  these  faithful  copies  of  popular  Muslim  coins,  and  God-fearing  Christians happily used them. <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>Tolerance  ourished on the other side of the hill too. Muslim merchants in North Africa conducted business using Christian coins such as the Florentine  orin, the Venetian  ducat  and  the  Neapolitan  gigliato.  Even  Muslim  rulers  who  called  for jihad against the in del Christians were glad to receive taxes in coins that invoked Christ and His Virgin Mother. <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">How Much is It? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hunter-gatherers  had  no  money.  Each  band  hunted,  gathered  and  manufactured almost  everything  it  required,  from  meat  to  medicine,  from  sandals  to  sorcery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Di erent band members may have specialised in di erent tasks, but they shared their goods and services through an economy of favours and obligations. A piece of meat given for free would carry with it the assumption of reciprocity – say, free medical  assistance.  The  band  was  economically  independent;  only  a  few  rare items that could not be found locally – seashells, pigments, obsidian and the like –</p>
<p class="calibre1">had to be obtained from strangers. This could usually be done by simple barter:</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We’ll give you pretty seashells, and you’ll give us high-quality flint.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Little of this changed with the onset of the Agricultural Revolution. Most people continued  to  live  in  small,  intimate  communities.  Much  like  a  hunter-gatherer band,  each  village  was  a  self-su cient  economic  unit,  maintained  by  mutual favours and obligations plus a little barter with outsiders. One villager may have been particularly adept at making shoes, another at dispensing medical care, so villagers knew where to turn when barefoot or sick. But villages were small and their economies limited, so there could be no full-time shoemakers and doctors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rise of cities and kingdoms and the improvement in transport infrastructure brought  about  new  opportunities  for  specialisation.  Densely  populated  cities provided full-time employment not just for professional shoemakers and doctors, but  also  for  carpenters,  priests,  soldiers  and  lawyers.  Villages  that  gained  a reputation for producing really good wine, olive oil or ceramics discovered that it was worth their while to specialise nearly exclusively in that product and trade it with  other  settlements  for  all  the  other  goods  they  needed.  This  made  a  lot  of sense. Climates and soils differ, so why drink mediocre wine from your backyard if you  can  buy  a  smoother  variety  from  a  place  whose  soil  and  climate  is  much better  suited  to  grape  vines?  If  the  clay  in  your  backyard  makes  stronger  and prettier  pots,  then  you  can  make  an  exchange.  Furthermore,  full-time  specialist vintners and potters, not to mention doctors and lawyers, can hone their expertise to the bene t of all. But specialisation created a problem – how do you manage the exchange of goods between the specialists? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>An  economy  of  favours  and  obligations  doesn’t  work  when  large  numbers  of strangers try to cooperate. It’s one thing to provide free assistance to a sister or a neighbour,  a  very  di erent  thing  to  take  care  of  foreigners  who  might  never reciprocate  the  favour.  One  can  fall  back  on  barter.  But  barter  is  e ective  only when  exchanging  a  limited  range  of  products.  It  cannot  form  the  basis  for  a complex economy. <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to understand the limitations of barter, imagine that you own an apple orchard in the hill country that produces the crispest, sweetest apples in the entire province.  You  work  so  hard  in  your  orchard  that  your  shoes  wear  out.  So  you harness up your donkey cart and head to the market town down by the river. Your neighbour told you that a shoemaker on the south end of the marketplace made him a really sturdy pair of boots that’s lasted him through  ve seasons. You  nd the shoemaker’s shop and o er to barter some of your apples in exchange for the shoes you need. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  shoemaker  hesitates.  How  many  apples  should  he  ask  for  in  payment? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every day he encounters dozens of customers, a few of whom bring along sacks of apples,  while  others  carry  wheat,  goats  or  cloth  –  all  of  varying  quality.  Still others o er their expertise in petitioning the king or curing backaches. The last time the shoemaker exchanged shoes for apples was three months ago, and back then he asked for three sacks of apples. Or was it four? But come to think of it, those apples were sour valley apples, rather than prime hill apples. On the other hand,  on  that  previous  occasion,  the  apples  were  given  in  exchange  for  small women’s shoes. This fellow is asking for man-size boots. Besides, in recent weeks a disease has decimated the  ocks around town, and skins are becoming scarce. The tanners are starting to demand twice as many  nished shoes in exchange for the same quantity of leather. Shouldn’t that be taken into consideration? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a barter economy, every day the shoemaker and the apple grower will have to  learn  anew  the  relative  prices  of  dozens  of  commodities.  If  one  hundred di erent commodities are traded in the market, then buyers and sellers will have to  know  4,950  di erent  exchange  rates.  And  if  1,000  di erent  commodities  are traded, buyers and sellers must juggle 499,500 di erent exchange rates! <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">5 </a>How do you figure it out? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It gets worse. Even if you manage to calculate how many apples equal one pair of shoes, barter is not always possible. After all, a trade requires that each side want  what  the  other  has  to  o er.  What  happens  if  the  shoemaker  doesn’t  like apples and, if at the moment in question, what he really wants is a divorce? True, the farmer could look for a lawyer who likes apples and set up a three-way deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what if the lawyer is full up on apples but really needs a haircut? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some societies tried to solve the problem by establishing a central barter system that collected products from specialist growers and manufacturers and distributed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>them  to  those  who  needed  them.  The  largest  and  most  famous  such  experiment was conducted in the Soviet Union, and it failed miserably. ‘Everyone would work according  to  their  abilities,  and  receive  according  to  their  needs’  turned  out  in practice  into  ‘everyone  would  work  as  little  as  they  can  get  away  with,  and receive  as  much  as  they  could  grab’.  More  moderate  and  more  successful experiments were made on other occasions, for example in the Inca Empire. Yet most societies found a more easy way to connect large numbers of experts – they developed money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shel s and Cigarettes</p>
<p class="calibre1">Money  was  created  many  times  in  many  places.  Its  development  required  no technological breakthroughs – it was a purely mental revolution. It involved the creation  of  a  new  inter-subjective  reality  that  exists  solely  in  people’s  shared imagination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Money is not coins and banknotes. Money is anything that people are willing to use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose of exchanging goods and services. Money enables people to compare quickly and easily the value of di erent commodities (such as apples, shoes and divorces), to easily  exchange  one  thing  for  another,  and  to  store  wealth  conveniently. There have  been  many  types  of  money.  The  most  familiar  is  the  coin,  which  is  a standardised  piece  of  imprinted  metal.  Yet  money  existed  long  before  the invention of coinage, and cultures have prospered using other things as currency, such as shells, cattle, skins, salt, grain, beads, cloth and promissory notes. Cowry shells were used as money for about 4,000 years all over Africa, South Asia, East Asia and Oceania. Taxes could still be paid in cowry shells in British Uganda in the early twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a><img src="index-155_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">26. </b></a><b class="calibre3"> In ancient Chinese script the cowry-shell sign represented money, in words such as ‘to sell’ or</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">‘reward’</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  modern  prisons  and  POW  camps,  cigarettes  have  often  served  as  money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  non-smoking  prisoners  have  been  willing  to  accept  cigarettes  in  payment, and  to  calculate  the  value  of  all  other  goods  and  services  in  cigarettes.  One Auschwitz survivor described the cigarette currency used in the camp: ‘We had our own currency, whose value no one questioned: the cigarette. The price of every article was stated in cigarettes … In “normal” times, that is, when the candidates to the gas chambers were coming in at a regular pace, a loaf of bread cost twelve cigarettes; a 300-gram package of margarine, thirty; a watch, eighty to 200; a litre of alcohol, 400 cigarettes!’<a href="index_split_005.html#p358">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, even today coins and banknotes are a rare form of money. In 2006, the sum total of money in the world is about $60 trillion, yet the sum total of coins and banknotes was less than $6 trillion<a href="index_split_005.html#p358">.7</a> More than 90 per cent of all money –</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  than  $50  trillion  appearing  in  our  accounts  –  exists  only  on  computer servers. Accordingly, most business transactions are executed by moving electronic data from one computer  le to another, without any exchange of physical cash. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>Only  a  criminal  buys  a  house,  for  example,  by  handing  over  a  suitcase  full  of banknotes. As long as people are willing to trade goods and services in exchange for electronic data, it’s even better than shiny coins and crisp banknotes – lighter, less bulky, and easier to keep track of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  complex  commercial  systems  to  function,  some  kind  of  money  is indispensable. A shoemaker in a money economy needs to know only the prices charged for various kinds of shoes – there is no need to memorise the exchange rates between shoes and apples or goats. Money also frees apple experts from the need  to  search  out  apple-craving  shoemakers,  because  everyone  always  wants money.  This  is  perhaps  its  most  basic  quality.  Everyone  always  wants  money because everyone else also always wants money, which means you can exchange money for whatever you want or need. The shoemaker will always be happy to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take  your  money,  because  no  matter  what  he  really  wants  –  apples,  goats  or  a divorce – he can get it in exchange for money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Money is thus a universal medium of exchange that enables people to convert almost everything into almost anything else. Brawn gets converted to brain when a  discharged  soldier  nances  his  college  tuition  with  his  military  bene ts.  Land gets converted into loyalty when a baron sells property to support his retainers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Health is converted to justice when a physician uses her fees to hire a lawyer – or bribe a judge. It is even possible to convert sex into salvation, as  fteenth-century prostitutes did when they slept with men for money, which they in turn used to buy indulgences from the Catholic Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ideal types of money enable people not merely to turn one thing into another, but  to  store  wealth  as  well.  Many  valuables  cannot  be  stored  –  such  as  time  or beauty.  Some  things  can  be  stored  only  for  a  short  time,  such  as  strawberries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other things are more durable, but take up a lot of space and require expensive facilities and care. Grain, for example, can be stored for years, but to do so you need  to  build  huge  storehouses  and  guard  against  rats,  mould,  water,  re  and thieves.  Money,  whether  paper,  computer  bits  or  cowry  shells,  solves  these problems. Cowry shells don’t rot, are unpalatable to rats, can survive  res and are compact enough to be locked up in a safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  use  wealth  it  is  not  enough  just  to  store  it.  It  often  needs  to  be transported from place to place. Some forms of wealth, such as real estate, cannot be transported at all. Commodities such as wheat and rice can be transported only with  di culty.  Imagine  a  wealthy  farmer  living  in  a  moneyless  land  who emigrates to a distant province. His wealth consists mainly of his house and rice paddies.  The  farmer  cannot  take  with  him  the  house  or  the  paddies.  He  might exchange them for tons of rice, but it would be very burdensome and expensive to transport  all  that  rice.  Money  solves  these  problems.  The  farmer  can  sell  his property  in  exchange  for  a  sack  of  cowry  shells,  which  he  can  easily  carry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>wherever he goes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because money can convert, store and transport wealth easily and cheaply,  it made a vital contribution to the appearance of complex commercial networks and dynamic markets. Without money, commercial networks and markets would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been doomed to remain very limited in their size, complexity and dynamism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How Does Money Work? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cowry shells and dollars have value only in our common imagination. Their worth is not inherent in the chemical structure of the shells and paper, or their colour, or their shape. In other words, money isn’t a material reality – it is a psychological construct. It works by converting matter into mind. But why does it succeed? Why should anyone be willing to exchange a fertile rice paddy for a handful of useless cowry  shells?  Why  are  you  willing  to  ip  hamburgers,  sell  health  insurance  or babysit three obnoxious brats when all you get for your exertions is a few pieces of coloured paper? </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  are  willing  to  do  such  things  when  they  trust  the  gments  of  their collective imagination. Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted. When a wealthy farmer sold his possessions for a sack of cowry shells and  travelled  with  them  to  another  province,  he  trusted  that  upon  reaching  his destination  other  people  would  be  willing  to  sell  him  rice,  houses  and  elds  in exchange for the shells. Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust:  <i class="calibre4">money is the most universal and most efficient system</i> <i class="calibre4">of mutual trust ever devised</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What created this trust was a very complex and long-term network of political, social and economic relations. Why do I believe in the cowry shell or gold coin or dollar bill? Because my neighbours believe in them. And my neighbours believe in them  because  I  believe  in  them.  And  we  all  believe  in  them  because  our  king believes in them and demands them in taxes, and because our priest believes in them and demands them in tithes. Take a dollar bill and look at it carefully. You will see that it is simply a colourful piece of paper with the signature of the US</p>
<p class="calibre1">secretary  of  the  treasury  on  one  side,  and  the  slogan  ‘In  God  We  Trust’  on  the other.  We  accept  the  dollar  in  payment,  because  we  trust  in  God  and  the  US</p>
<p class="calibre1">secretary  of  the  treasury. The  crucial  role  of  trust  explains  why  our  nancial systems are so tightly bound up with our political, social and ideological systems, why  nancial  crises  are  often  triggered  by  political  developments,  and  why  the stock  market  can  rise  or  fall  depending  on  the  way  traders  feel  on  a  particular morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>Initially, when the  rst versions of money were created, people didn’t have this sort of trust, so it was necessary to de ne as ‘money’ things that had real intrinsic value. History’s first known money Sumerian barley money – is a good example. It appeared  in  Sumer  around  3000 BC,  at  the  same  time  and  place,  and  under  the same  circumstances,  in  which  writing  appeared.  Just  as  writing  developed  to answer  the  needs  of  intensifying  administrative  activities,  so  barley  money developed to answer the needs of intensifying economic activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barley  money  was  simply  barley  –  xed  amounts  of  barley  grains  used  as  a universal measure for evaluating and exchanging all other goods and services. The most  common  measurement  was  the  sila,  equivalent  to  roughly  one  litre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standardised bowls, each capable of containing one sila, were mass-produced so that whenever people needed to buy or sell anything, it was easy to measure the necessary amounts of barley. Salaries, too, were set and paid in silas of barley. A male labourer earned sixty silas a month, a female labourer thirty silas. A foreman could earn between 1,200 and 5,000 silas. Not even the most ravenous foreman could eat 5,000 litres of barley a month, but he could use the silas he didn’t eat to buy all sorts of other commodities – oil, goats, slaves, and something else to eat besides barley. <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though barley has intrinsic value, it was not easy to convince people to use  it  as  <i class="calibre4">money</i>  rather  than  as  just  another  commodity.  In  order  to  understand why, just think what would happen if you took a sack full of barley to your local shopping centre, and tried to buy a shirt or a pizza. The vendors would probably call security. Still, it was somewhat easier to build trust in barley as the  rst type of money, because barley has an inherent biological value. Humans can eat it. On the  other  hand,  it  was  di cult  to  store  and  transport  barley.  The  real breakthrough  in  monetary  history  occurred  when  people  gained  trust  in  money that  lacked  inherent  value,  but  was  easier  to  store  and  transport.  Such  money appeared  in  ancient  Mesopotamia in the middle of the third millennium BC.  This was the silver shekel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  silver  shekel  was  not  a  coin,  but  rather  8.33  grams  of  silver.  When Hammurabi’s Code declared that a superior man who killed a slave woman must pay her owner twenty silver shekels, it meant that he had to pay 166 grams of silver, not twenty coins. Most monetary terms in the Old Testament are given in terms of silver rather than coins. Josephs brothers sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty  silver  shekels,  or  rather  166  grams  of  silver  (the  same  price  as  a  slave woman – he was a youth, after all). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike the barley sila, the silver shekel had no inherent value. You cannot eat, drink  or  clothe  yourself  in  silver,  and  it’s  too  soft  for  making  useful  tools  –</p>
<p class="calibre1">ploughshares or swords of silver would crumple almost as fast as ones made out of aluminium foil. When they are used for anything, silver and gold are made into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a><img src="index-159_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">jewellery,  crowns  and  other  status  symbols  –  luxury  goods  that  members  of  a particular culture identify with high social status. Their value is purely cultural. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Set  weights  of  precious  metals  eventually  gave  birth  to  coins.  The  rst  coins  in history were struck around 640 BC by King Alyattes of Lydia, in western Anatolia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These coins had a standardised weight of gold or silver, and were imprinted with an  identi cation  mark.  The  mark  testi ed  to  two  things.  First,  it  indicated  how much  precious  metal  the  coin  contained.  Second,  it  identi ed  the  authority  that issued the coin and that guaranteed its contents. Almost all coins in use today are descendants of the Lydian coins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coins  had  two  important  advantages  over  unmarked  metal  ingots.  First,  the latter had to be weighed for every transaction. Second, weighing the ingot is not enough. How does the shoemaker know that the silver ingot I put down for my boots is really made of pure silver, and not of lead covered on the outside by a thin silver coating? Coins help solve these problems. The mark imprinted on them testi es to their exact value, so the shoemaker doesn’t have to keep a scale on his cash  register.  More  importantly,  the  mark  on  the  coin  is  the  signature  of  some political authority that guarantees the coin’s value. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shape and size of the mark varied tremendously throughout history, but the message was always the same: ‘I, the Great King So-And-So, give you my personal word  that  this  metal  disc  contains  exactly  ve  grams  of  gold.  If  anyone  dares counterfeit this coin, it means he is fabricating my own signature, which would be a  blot  on  my  reputation.  I  will  punish  such  a  crime  with  the  utmost  severity.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s why counterfeiting money has always been considered a much more serious crime  than  other  acts  of  deception.  Counterfeiting  is  not  just  cheating  –  it’s  a breach  of  sovereignty,  an  act  of  subversion  against  the  power,  privileges  and person  of  the  king.  The  legal  term  is  lese-majesty  (violating  majesty),  and  was typically punished by torture and death. As long as people trusted the power and integrity of the king, they trusted his coins. Total strangers could easily agree on the worth of a Roman denarius coin, because they trusted the power and integrity of the Roman emperor, whose name and picture adorned it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">27. </b></a><b class="calibre3">One of the earliest coins in history, from Lydia of the seventh century BC. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  turn,  the  power  of  the  emperor  rested  on  the  denarius.  Just  think  how di cult it would have been to maintain the Roman Empire without coins – if the emperor had to raise taxes and pay salaries in barley and wheat. It would have been impossible to collect barley taxes in Syria, transport the funds to the central treasury in Rome, and transport them again to Britain in order to pay the legions there.  It  would  have  been  equally  di cult  to  maintain  the  empire  if  the inhabitants of the city of Rome believed in gold coins, but the subject populations rejected this belief, putting their trust instead in cowry shells, ivory beads or rolls of cloth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gospel of Gold</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  trust  in  Rome’s  coins  was  so  strong  that  even  outside  the  empire’s  borders, people were happy to receive payment in denarii. In the  rst century AD, Roman coins were an accepted medium of exchange in the markets of India, even though the closest Roman legion was thousands of kilometres away. The Indians had such a strong con dence in the denarius and the image of the emperor that when local rulers  struck  coins  of  their  own  they  closely  imitated  the  denarius,  down  to  the portrait of the Roman emperor! The name ‘denarius’ became a generic name for coins. Muslim caliphs Arabicised this name and issued ‘dinars’. The dinar is still the o cial name of the currency in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Macedonia, Tunisia and several other countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Lydian-style  coinage  was  spreading  from  the  Mediterranean  to  the  Indian Ocean,  China  developed  a  slightly  di erent  monetary  system,  based  on  bronze coins  and  unmarked  silver  and  gold  ingots.  Yet  the  two  monetary  systems  had enough  in  common  (especially  the  reliance  on  gold  and  silver)  that  close monetary  and  commercial  relations  were  established  between  the  Chinese  zone and the Lydian zone. Muslim and European merchants and conquerors gradually spread the Lydian system and the gospel of gold to the far corners of the earth. By the late modern era the entire world was a single monetary zone, relying  rst on gold and silver, and later on a few trusted currencies such as the British pound and the American dollar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The appearance of a single transnational and transcultural monetary zone laid the foundation for the uni cation of Afro-Asia, and eventually of the entire globe, into a single economic and political sphere. People continued to speak mutually incomprehensible languages, obey di erent rulers and worship distinct gods, but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>all believed in gold and silver and in gold and silver coins. Without this shared belief,  global  trading  networks  would  have  been  virtually  impossible.  The  gold and  silver  that  sixteenth-century  conquistadors  found  in  America  enabled European merchants to buy silk, porcelain and spices in East Asia, thereby moving the wheels of economic growth in both Europe and East Asia. Most of the gold and silver mined in Mexico and the Andes slipped through European  ngers to  nd a welcome home in the purses of Chinese silk and porcelain manufacturers. What would have happened to the global economy if the Chinese hadn’t su ered from the same ‘disease of the heart’ that a icted Cortés and his companions – and had refused to accept payment in gold and silver? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  why  should  Chinese,  Indians,  Muslims  and  Spaniards  –  who  belonged  to very di erent cultures that failed to agree about much of anything – nevertheless share  the  belief  in  gold?  Why  didn’t  it  happen  that  Spaniards  believed  in  gold, while Muslims believed in barley, Indians in cowry shells, and Chinese in rolls of silk? Economists have a ready answer. Once trade connects two areas, the forces of supply and demand tend to equalise the prices of transportable goods. In order to understand why, consider a hypothetical case. Assume that when regular trade opened between India and the Mediterranean, Indians were uninterested in gold, so it was almost worthless. But in the Mediterranean, gold was a coveted status symbol, hence its value was high. What would happen next? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merchants  travelling  between  India  and  the  Mediterranean  would  notice  the di erence  in  the  value  of  gold.  In  order  to  make  a  pro t,  they  would  buy  gold cheaply  in  India  and  sell  it  dearly  in  the  Mediterranean.  Consequently,  the demand for gold in India would skyrocket, as would its value. At the same time the  Mediterranean  would  experience  an  in ux  of  gold,  whose  value  would consequently  drop.  Within  a  short  time  the  value  of  gold  in  India  and  the Mediterranean would be quite similar. The mere fact that Mediterranean people believed  in  gold  would  cause  Indians  to  start  believing  in  it  as  well.  Even  if Indians still had no real use for gold, the fact that Mediterranean people wanted it would be enough to make the Indians value it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarly,  the  fact  that  another  person  believes  in  cowry  shells,  or  dollars,  or electronic  data,  is  enough  to  strengthen  our  own  belief  in  them,  even  if  that person is otherwise hated, despised or ridiculed by us. Christians and Muslims who could not agree on religious beliefs could nevertheless agree on a monetary belief, because whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that  <i class="calibre4">other people believe in something</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  thousands  of  years,  philosophers,  thinkers  and  prophets  have  besmirched money  and  called  it  the  root  of  all  evil.  Be  that  as  it  may,  money  is  also  the apogee  of  human  tolerance.  Money  is  more  open-minded  than  language,  state laws,  cultural  codes,  religious  beliefs  and  social  habits.  Money  is  the  only  trust</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Price of Money</p>
<p class="calibre1">Money is based on two universal principles:</p>
<p class="calibre1">a. Universal convertibility: with money as an alchemist, you can turn land into loyalty, justice into health, and violence into knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">b. Universal trust: with money as a go-between, any two people can cooperate on any project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These principles have enabled millions of strangers to cooperate e ectively in trade and industry. But these seemingly benign principles have a dark side. When everything is convertible, and when trust depends on anonymous coins and cowry shells, it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing them with the cold laws of supply and demand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Human communities and families have always been based on belief in ‘priceless’</p>
<p class="calibre1">things,  such  as  honour,  loyalty,  morality  and  love.  These  things  lie  outside  the domain of the market, and they shouldn’t be bought or sold for money. Even if the market  o ers  a  good  price,  certain  things  just  aren’t  done.  Parents  mustn’t  sell their  children  into  slavery;  a  devout  Christian  must  not  commit  a  mortal  sin;  a loyal knight must never betray his lord; and ancestral tribal lands shall never be sold to foreigners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Money  has  always  tried  to  break  through  these  barriers,  like  water  seeping through  cracks  in  a  dam.  Parents  have  been  reduced  to  selling  some  of  their children into slavery in order to buy food for the others. Devout Christians have murdered, stolen and cheated – and later used their spoils to buy forgiveness from the  church.  Ambitious  knights  auctioned  their  allegiance  to  the  highest  bidder, while securing the loyalty of their own followers by cash payments. Tribal lands were sold to foreigners from the other side of the world in order to purchase an entry ticket into the global economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Money  has  an  even  darker  side.  For  although  money  builds  universal  trust between  strangers,  this  trust  is  invested  not  in  humans,  communities  or  sacred values, but in money itself and in the impersonal systems that back it. We do not trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour – we trust the coin they hold. If they run  out  of  coins,  we  run  out  of  trust.  As  money  brings  down  the  dams  of community,  religion  and  state,  the  world  is  in  danger  of  becoming  one  big  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>rather heartless marketplace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence the economic history of humankind is a delicate dance. People rely on money to facilitate cooperation with strangers, but they’re afraid it will corrupt human values and intimate relations. With one hand people willingly destroy the communal dams that held at bay the movement of money and commerce for so</p>
<p class="calibre1">long. Yet with the other hand they build new dams to protect society, religion and the environment from enslavement to market forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is common nowadays to believe that the market always prevails, and that the dams erected by kings, priests and communities cannot long hold back the tides of money.  This  is  naïve.  Brutal  warriors,  religious  fanatics  and  concerned  citizens have repeatedly managed to trounce calculating merchants, and even to reshape the  economy.  It  is  therefore  impossible  to  understand  the  uni cation  of humankind as a purely economic process. In order to understand how thousands of  isolated  cultures  coalesced  over  time  to  form  the  global  village  of  today,  we must  take  into  account  the  role  of  gold  and  silver,  but  we  cannot  disregard  the equally crucial role of steel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a><b class="calibre3">II</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial Visions</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE ANCIENT ROMANS WERE USED TO being defeated. Like the rulers of most of</p>
<p class="calibre1">history’s great empires, they could lose battle after battle but still win the war. An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet even the Romans found it hard to stomach the news arriving from northern Iberia in the middle of the second century BC. A small, insigni cant mountain town called Numantia, inhabited by the peninsula’s native Celts, had dared to throw o the  Roman  yoke.  Rome  at  the  time  was  the  unquestioned  master  of  the  entire Mediterranean  basin,  having  vanquished  the  Macedonian  and  Seleucid  empires, subjugated  the  proud  city  states  of  Greece,  and  turned  Carthage  into  a smouldering ruin. The Numantians had nothing on their side but their  erce love of freedom and their inhospitable terrain. Yet they forced legion after legion to surrender or retreat in shame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  in  134 BC,  Roman  patience  snapped.  The  Senate  decided  to  send Scipio  Aemilianus,  Rome’s  foremost  general  and  the  man  who  had  levelled Carthage, to take care of the Numantians. He was given a massive army of more than 30,000 soldiers. Scipio, who respected the  ghting spirit and martial skill of the  Numantians,  preferred  not  to  waste  his  soldiers  in  unnecessary  combat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,  he  encircled  Numantia  with  a  line  of  forti cations,  blocking  the  town’s contact with the outside world. Hunger did his work for him. After more than a year, the food supply ran out. When the Numantians realised that all hope was lost, they burned down their town; according to Roman accounts, most of them killed themselves so as not to become Roman slaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Numantia later became a symbol of Spanish independence and courage. Miguel</p>
<p class="calibre1">de  Cervantes,  the  author  of  <i class="calibre4">Don  Quixote</i>,  wrote  a  tragedy  called  <i class="calibre4">The  Siege  of</i> <i class="calibre4">Numantia</i> which ends with the town’s destruction, but also with a vision of Spain’s future  greatness.  Poets  composed  paeans  to  its  erce  defenders  and  painters committed  majestic  depictions  of  the  siege  to  canvas.  In  1882,  its  ruins  were declared a national monument’ and became a pilgrimage site for Spanish patriots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  most  popular  comic  books  in  Spain  weren’t  about Superman and Spiderman – they told of the adventures of El Jabato, an imaginary ancient  Iberian  hero  who  fought  against  the  Roman  oppressors.  The  ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>Numantians are to this day Spain’s paragons of heroism and patriotism, cast as role models for the country’s young people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet Spanish patriots extol the Numantians in  <i class="calibre4">Spanish –</i> a romance language that is a progeny of Scipio’s Latin. The Numantians spoke a now dead and lost Celtic language.  Cervantes  wrote  <i class="calibre4">The  Siege  of  Numantia</i>  in  Latin  script,  and  the  play follows Graeco-Roman artistic models. Numantia had no theatres. Spanish patriots who  admire  Numantian  heroism  tend  also  to  be  loyal  followers  of  the  Roman Catholic Church – don’t miss that  rst word – a church whose leader still sits in Rome and whose God prefers to be addressed in Latin. Similarly, modern Spanish law derives from Roman law; Spanish politics is built on Roman foundations; and Spanish cuisine and architecture owe a far greater debt to Roman legacies than to those of the Celts of Iberia. Nothing is really left of Numantia save ruins. Even its story  has  reached  us  thanks  only  to  the  writings  of  Roman  historians.  It  was tailored to the tastes of Roman audiences which relished tales of freedom-loving barbarians. The victory of Rome over Numantia was so complete that the victors co-opted the very memory of the vanquished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not our kind of story. We like to see underdogs win. But there is no justice in history. Most past cultures have sooner or later fallen prey to the armies of some ruthless empire, which have consigned them to oblivion. Empires, too, ultimately fall, but they tend to leave behind rich and enduring legacies. Almost all people in the twenty-first century are the offspring of one empire or another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is an Empire? </p>
<p class="calibre1">An empire is a political order with two important characteristics. First, to qualify for that designation you have to rule over a signi cant number of distinct peoples, each possessing a di erent cultural identity and a separate territory. How many peoples  exactly?  Two  or  three  is  not  su cient.  Twenty  or  thirty  is  plenty.  The imperial threshold passes somewhere in between. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,  empires  are  characterised  by  exible  borders  and  a  potentially unlimited  appetite.  They  can  swallow  and  digest  more  and  more  nations  and territories  without  altering  their  basic  structure  or  identity.  The  British  state  of today  has  fairly  clear  borders  that  cannot  be  exceeded  without  altering  the fundamental structure and identity of the state. A century ago almost any place on earth could have become part of the British Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cultural  diversity  and  territorial  exibility  give  empires  not  only  their  unique character,  but  also  their  central  role  in  history.  It’s  thanks  to  these  two characteristics  that  empires  have  managed  to  unite  diverse  ethnic  groups  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>ecological zones under a single political umbrella, thereby fusing together larger and larger segments of the human species and of planet Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It should be stressed that an empire is de ned solely by its cultural diversity and exible borders, rather than by its origins, its form of government, its territorial extent,  or  the  size  of  its  population.  An  empire  need  not  emerge  from  military conquest.  The  Athenian  Empire  began  its  life  as  a  voluntary  league,  and  the Habsburg  Empire  was  born  in  wedlock,  cobbled  together  by  a  string  of  shrewd marriage alliances. Nor must an empire be ruled by an autocratic emperor. The British  Empire,  the  largest  empire  in  history,  was  ruled  by  a  democracy.  Other democratic  (or  at  least  republican)  empires  have  included  the  modern  Dutch, French,  Belgian  and  American  empires,  as  well  as  the  premodern  empires  of Novgorod, Rome, Carthage and Athens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Size, too, does not really matter. Empires can be puny. The Athenian Empire at its zenith was much smaller in size and population than today’s Greece. The Aztec Empire was smaller than today’s Mexico. Both were nevertheless empires, whereas modern Greece and modern Mexico are not, because the former gradually subdued dozens and even hundreds of di erent polities while the latter have not. Athens lorded it over more than a hundred formerly independent city states, whereas the Aztec Empire, if we can trust its taxation records, ruled 371 di erent tribes and peoples. <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">How was it possible to squeeze such a human potpourri into the territory of a modest modern state? It was possible because in the past there were many more distinct  peoples  in  the  world,  each  of  which  had  a  smaller  population  and occupied  less  territory  than  today’s  typical  people.  The  land  between  the Mediterranean  and  the  Jordan  River,  which  today  struggles  to  satisfy  the ambitions  of  just  two  peoples,  easily  accommodated  in  biblical  times  dozens  of nations, tribes, petty kingdoms and city states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Empires  were  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  the  drastic  reduction  in  human diversity. The imperial steamroller gradually obliterated the unique characteristics of numerous peoples (such as the Numantians), forging out of them new and much larger groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evil Empires? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In our time, ‘imperialist’ ranks second only to ‘fascist’ in the lexicon of political swear words. The contemporary critique of empires commonly takes two forms: 1.  Empires  do  not  work.  In  the  long  run,  it  is  not  possible  to  rule  e ectively over a large number of conquered peoples. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>2.  Even  if  it  can  be  done,  it  should  not  be  done,  because  empires  are  evil engines  of  destruction  and  exploitation.  Every  people  has  a  right  to  self-determination, and should never be subject to the rule of another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  a  historical  perspective,  the  rst  statement  is  plain  nonsense,  and  the second is deeply problematic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  truth  is  that  empire  has  been  the  world’s  most  common  form  of  political organisation for the last 2,500 years. Most humans during these two and a half millennia have lived in empires. Empire is also a very stable form of government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  empires  have  found  it alarmingly easy to put down rebellions. In general, they have been toppled only by external invasion or by a split within the ruling elite.  Conversely,  conquered  peoples  don’t  have  a  very  good  record  of  freeing themselves  from  their  imperial  overlords.  Most  have  remained  subjugated  for hundreds  of  years.  Typically,  they  have  been  slowly  digested  by  the  conquering empire, until their distinct cultures fizzled out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  when  the  Western  Roman  Empire  nally  fell  to  invading Germanic  tribes  in  476 AD,  the  Numantians,  Arverni,  Helvetians,  Samnites, Lusitanians, Umbrians, Etruscans and hundreds of other forgotten peoples whom the  Romans  conquered  centuries  earlier  did  not  emerge  from  the  empires eviscerated carcass like Jonah from the belly of the great  sh. None of them were left.  The  biological  descendants  of  the  people  who  had  identi ed  themselves  as members of those nations, who had spoken their languages, worshipped their gods and told their myths and legends, now thought, spoke and worshipped as Romans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  many  cases,  the  destruction  of  one  empire  hardly  meant  independence  for subject peoples. Instead, a new empire stepped into the vacuum created when the old one collapsed or retreated. Nowhere has this been more obvious than in the Middle  East.  The  current  political  constellation  in  that  region  –  a  balance  of power  between  many  independent  political  entities  with  more  or  less  stable borders – is almost without parallel any time in the last several millennia. The last time the Middle East experienced such a situation was in the eighth century BC  –</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost 3,000 years ago! From the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the eighth century BC until the collapse of the British and French empires in the mid-twentieth century AD, the Middle East passed from the hands of one empire into the hands of another,  like  a  baton  in  a  relay  race.  And  by  the  time  the  British  and  French nally  dropped  the  baton,  the  Aramaeans,  the  Ammonites,  the  Phoenicians,  the Philistines,  the  Moabites,  the  Edomites  and  the  other  peoples  conquered  by  the Assyrians had long disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True,  today’s  Jews,  Armenians  and  Georgians  claim  with  some  measure  of justice that they are the o spring of ancient Middle Eastern peoples. Yet these are only  exceptions  that  prove  the  rule,  and  even  these  claims  are  somewhat</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>exaggerated.  It  goes  without  saying that  the  political,  economic  and  social practices of modern Jews, for example, owe far more to the empires under which they  lived  during  the  past  two  millennia  than  to  the  traditions  of  the  ancient kingdom  of  Judaea.  If  King  David  were  to  show  up  in  an  ultra-Orthodox synagogue  in  present-day  Jerusalem,  he  would  be  utterly  bewildered  to  nd people dressed in East European clothes, speaking in a German dialect (Yiddish) and  having  endless  arguments  about  the  meaning  of  a  Babylonian  text  (the Talmud).  There  were  neither  synagogues,  volumes  of  Talmud,  nor  even  Torah scrolls in ancient Judaea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Building and maintaining an empire usually required the vicious slaughter of large populations  and  the  brutal  oppression  of  everyone  who  was  left.  The  standard imperial toolkit included wars, enslavement, deportation and genocide. When the Romans invaded Scotland in AD 83, they were met by  erce resistance from local Caledonian tribes, and reacted by laying waste to the country. In reply to Roman peace o ers, the chieftain Calgacus called the Romans ‘the ru ans of the world’, and  said  that  ‘to  plunder,  slaughter  and  robbery  they  give  the  lying  name  of empire; they make a desert and call it peace’. <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  does  not  mean,  however,  that  empires  leave  nothing  of  value  in  their wake. To colour all empires black and to disavow all imperial legacies is to reject most of human culture. Imperial elites used the pro ts of conquest to  nance not only armies and forts but also philosophy, art, justice and charity. A signi cant proportion  of  humanity’s  cultural  achievements  owe  their  existence  to  the exploitation  of  conquered  populations.  The  pro ts  and  prosperity  brought  by Roman imperialism provided Cicero, Seneca and St Augustine with the leisure and wherewithal to think and write; the Taj Mahal could not have been built without the wealth accumulated by Mughal exploitation of their Indian subjects; and the Habsburg Empire’s pro ts from its rule over its Slavic, Hungarian and Romanian-speaking  provinces  paid  Haydn’s  salaries  and  Mozart’s  commissions.  No Caledonian writer preserved Calgacus’ speech for posterity. We know of it thanks to the Roman historian Tacitus. In fact, Tacitus probably made it up. Most scholars today agree that Tacitus not only fabricated the speech but invented the character of  Calgacus,  the Caledonian chieftain, to serve as a mouthpiece for what he and other upper-class Romans thought about their own country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  if  we  look  beyond  elite  culture  and  high  art,  and  focus  instead  on  the world  of  common  people,  we  nd  imperial  legacies  in  the  majority  of  modern cultures.  Today  most  of  us  speak,  think  and  dream  in  imperial  languages  that were forced upon our ancestors by the sword. Most East Asians speak and dream in the language of the Han Empire. No matter what their origins, nearly all the inhabitants  of  the  two  American  continents,  from  Alaska’s  Barrow  Peninsula  to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>the Straits of Magellan, communicate in one of four imperial languages: Spanish, Portuguese,  French  or  English.  Present-day  Egyptians  speak  Arabic,  think  of themselves  as  Arabs,  and  identify  wholeheartedly  with  the  Arab  Empire  that conquered Egypt in the seventh century and crushed with an iron  st the repeated revolts that broke out against its rule. About 10 million Zulus in South Africa hark back to the Zulu age of glory in the nineteenth century, even though most of them descend  from  tribes  who  fought  <i class="calibre4">against</i>  the  Zulu  Empire,  and  were  incorporated into it only through bloody military campaigns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s for Your Own Good</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst  empire  about  which  we  have  de nitive  information  was  the  Akkadian Empire  of  Sargon  the  Great  ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.2250 BC).  Sargon  began  his  career  as  the  king  of Kish,  a  small  city  state  in  Mesopotamia.  Within  a  few  decades  he  managed  to conquer  not  only  all  other  Mesopotamian  city  states,  but  also  large  territories outside the Mesopotamian heartland. Sargon boasted that he had conquered the entire  world.  In  reality,  his  dominion  stretched  from  the  Persian  Gulf  to  the Mediterranean,  and  included  most  of  today’s  Iraq  and  Syria,  along  with  a  few slices of modern Iran and Turkey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Akkadian Empire did not last long after its founder’s death, but Sargon left behind an imperial mantle that seldom remained unclaimed. For the next 1,700</p>
<p class="calibre1">years,  Assyrian,  Babylonian  and  Hittite  kings  adopted  Sargon  as  a  role  model, boasting  that  they,  too,  had  conquered  the  entire  world.  Then,  around  550 BC, Cyrus the Great of Persia came along with an even more impressive boast. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a><img src="index-170_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Map 4. The Akkadian Empire and the Persian Empire</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  kings  of  Assyria  always  remained  the  kings  of  Assyria.  Even  when  they claimed  to  rule  the  entire  world,  it  was  obvious  that  they  were  doing  it  for  the greater  glory  of  Assyria,  and  they  were  not  apologetic  about  it.  Cyrus,  on  the other hand, claimed not merely to rule the whole world, but to do so for the sake of  all  people.  ‘We  are  conquering  you  for  your  own  bene t,’  said  the  Persians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyrus wanted the peoples he subjected to love him and to count themselves lucky to  be  Persian  vassals.  The  most  famous  example  of  Cyrus’  innovative  e orts  to gain  the  approbation  of  a  nation  living  under  the  thumb  of  his  empire  was  his command  that  the  Jewish  exiles  in  Babylonia  be  allowed  to  return  to  their Judaean  homeland  and  rebuild  their  temple.  He  even  o ered  them  nancial assistance. Cyrus did not see himself as a Persian king ruling over Jews – he was also the king of the Jews, and thus responsible for their welfare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  presumption  to  rule  the  entire  world  for  the  bene t  of  all  its  inhabitants was  startling.  Evolution  has  made  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>,  like  other  social  mammals,  a xenophobic  creature.  Sapiens  instinctively  divide  humanity  into  two  parts,  ‘we’</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ‘they’. We are people like you and me, who share our language, religion and customs. We are all responsible for each other, but not responsible for them. We were always distinct from them, and owe them nothing. We don’t want to see any of them in our territory, and we don’t care an iota what happens in their territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are barely even human. In the language of the Dinka people of the Sudan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dinka’  simply  means  ‘people’.  People  who  are  not  Dinka  are  not  people.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>Dinka’s  bitter  enemies  are  the  Nuer.  What  does  the  word  Nuer  mean  in  Nuer language?  It  means  ‘original  people’.  Thousands  of  kilometres  from  the  Sudan deserts,  in  the  frozen  ice-lands  of  Alaska  and  north-eastern  Siberia,  live  the Yupiks. What does Yupik mean in Yupik language? It means ‘real people’. <a href="index_split_005.html#p358">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast with this ethnic exclusiveness, imperial ideology from Cyrus onward has  tended  to  be  inclusive  and  all-encompassing.  Even  though  it  has  often emphasised  racial  and  cultural  di erences  between  rulers  and  ruled,  it  has  still recognised  the  basic  unity  of  the  entire  world,  the  existence  of  a  single  set  of principles  governing  all  places  and  times,  and  the  mutual  responsibilities  of  all human beings. Humankind is seen as a large family: the privileges of the parents go hand in hand with responsibility for the welfare of the children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This new imperial vision passed from Cyrus and the Persians to Alexander the Great, and from him to Hellenistic kings, Roman emperors, Muslim caliphs, Indian dynasts,  and  eventually  even  to  Soviet  premiers  and  American  presidents.  This benevolent imperial vision has justi ed the existence of empires, and negated not only  attempts  by  subject  peoples  to  rebel,  but  also  attempts  by  independent peoples to resist imperial expansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similar imperial visions were developed independently of the Persian model in other parts of the world, most notably in Central America, in the Andean region, and in China. According to traditional Chinese political theory, Heaven ( <i class="calibre4">Tian</i>)  is the source of all legitimate authority on earth. Heaven chooses the most worthy person or family and gives them the Mandate of Heaven. This person or family then rules over All Under Heaven ( <i class="calibre4">Tianxia</i>) for the bene t of all its inhabitants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus,  a  legitimate  authority  is  –  by  de nition  –  universal.  If  a  ruler  lacks  the Mandate of Heaven, then he lacks legitimacy to rule even a single city. If a ruler enjoys  the  mandate,  he  is  obliged  to  spread  justice  and  harmony  to  the  entire world.  The  Mandate  of  Heaven  could  not  be  given  to  several  candidates simultaneously, and consequently one could not legitimise the existence of more than one independent state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst emperor of the united Chinese empire, Qín Shǐ Huángdì, boasted that</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘throughout  the  six  directions  [of  the  universe]  everything  belongs  to  the emperor  …  wherever  there  is  a  human  footprint,  there  is  not  one  who  did  not become a subject [of the emperor] … his kindness reaches even oxen and horses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is not one who did not bene t. Every man is safe under his own roof.’<a href="index_split_005.html#p359">4 </a>In Chinese political thinking as well as Chinese historical memory, imperial periods were henceforth seen as golden ages of order and justice. In contradiction to the modern Western view that a just world is composed of separate nation states, in China  periods  of  political  fragmentation  were  seen  as  dark  ages  of  chaos  and injustice.  This  perception  has  had  far-reaching  implications  for  Chinese  history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every time an empire collapsed, the dominant political theory goaded the powers</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>that  be  not  to  settle  for  paltry  independent  principalities,  but  to  attempt reunification. Sooner or later these attempts always succeeded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When They Become Us</p>
<p class="calibre1">Empires  have  played  a  decisive  part  in  amalgamating  many  small  cultures  into fewer big cultures. Ideas, people, goods and technology spread more easily within the borders of an empire than in a politically fragmented region. Often enough, it was the empires themselves which deliberately spread ideas, institutions, customs and norms. One reason was to make life easier for themselves. It is di cult to rule an empire in which every little district has its own set of laws, its own form of writing,  its  own  language  and  its  own  money.  Standardisation  was  a  boon  to emperors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A second and equally important reason why empires actively spread a common</p>
<p class="calibre1">culture  was  to  gain  legitimacy.  At  least  since  the  days  of  Cyrus  and  Qín  Shǐ</p>
<p class="calibre1">Huángdì, empires have justi ed their actions – whether road-building or bloodshed</p>
<p class="calibre1">– as necessary to spread a superior culture from which the conquered bene t even more than the conquerors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  bene ts  were  sometimes  salient  –  law  enforcement,  urban  planning, standardisation  of  weights  and  measures  –  and  sometimes  questionable  –  taxes, conscription,  emperor  worship.  But  most  imperial  elites  earnestly  believed  that they were working for the general welfare of all the empires inhabitants. China’s ruling class treated their country’s neighbours and its foreign subjects as miserable barbarians to whom the empire must bring the bene ts of culture. The Mandate of Heaven was bestowed upon the emperor not in order to exploit the world, but in order to educate humanity. The Romans, too, justi ed their dominion by arguing that they were endowing the barbarians with peace, justice and re nement. The wild  Germans  and  painted  Gauls  had  lived  in  squalor  and  ignorance  until  the Romans  tamed  them  with  law,  cleaned  them  up  in  public  bathhouses,  and improved them with philosophy. The Mauryan Empire in the third century BC took as its mission the dissemination of Buddha’s teachings to an ignorant world. The Muslim  caliphs  received  a  divine  mandate  to  spread  the  Prophet’s  revelation, peacefully if possible but by the sword if necessary. The Spanish and Portuguese empires proclaimed that it was not riches they sought in the Indies and America, but converts to the true faith. The sun never set on the British mission to spread the  twin  gospels  of  liberalism  and  free  trade.  The  Soviets  felt  duty-bound  to facilitate  the  inexorable  historical  march  from  capitalism  towards  the  utopian dictatorship  of  the  proletariat.  Many  Americans  nowadays  maintain  that  their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>government has a moral imperative to bring Third World countries the bene ts of democracy and human rights, even if these goods are delivered by cruise missiles and F-16s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cultural ideas spread by empire were seldom the exclusive creation of the ruling elite. Since the imperial vision tends to be universal and inclusive, it was relatively  easy  for  imperial  elites  to  adopt  ideas,  norms  and  traditions  from wherever they found them, rather than to stick fanatically to a single hidebound tradition. While some emperors sought to purify their cultures and return to what they  viewed  as  their  roots,  for  the  most  part  empires  have  begot  hybrid civilisations that absorbed much from their subject peoples. The imperial culture of Rome was Greek almost as much as Roman. The imperial Abbasid culture was part Persian, part Greek, part Arab. Imperial Mongol culture was a Chinese copycat. In the imperial United States, an American president of Kenyan blood can munch on Italian pizza while watching his favourite  lm,  <i class="calibre4">Lawrence of Arabia</i>, a British epic about the Arab rebellion against the Turks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not that this cultural melting pot made the process of cultural assimilation any easier  for  the  vanquished.  The  imperial  civilisation  may  well  have  absorbed numerous contributions from various conquered peoples, but the hybrid result was still alien to the vast majority. The process of assimilation was often painful and traumatic. It is not easy to give up a familiar and loved local tradition, just as it is di cult  and  stressful  to  understand  and  adopt  a  new  culture.  Worse  still,  even when  subject  peoples  were  successful  in  adopting  the  imperial  culture,  it  could take decades, if not centuries, until the imperial elite accepted them as part of ‘us’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The generations between conquest and acceptance were left out in the cold. They had already lost their beloved local culture, but they were not allowed to take an equal part in the imperial world. On the contrary, their adopted culture continued to view them as barbarians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine an Iberian of good stock living a century after the fall of Numantia. He speaks  his  native  Celtic  dialect  with  his  parents,  but  has  acquired  impeccable Latin, with only a slight accent, because he needs it to conduct his business and deal with the authorities. He indulges his wife’s penchant for elaborately ornate baubles, but is a bit embarrassed that she, like other local women, retains this relic of Celtic taste – he’d rather have her adopt the clean simplicity of the jewellery worn by the Roman governor’s wife. He himself wears Roman tunics and, thanks to  his  success  as  a  cattle  merchant,  due  in  no  small  part  to  his  expertise  in  the intricacies  of  Roman  commercial  law,  he  has  been  able  to  build  a  Roman-style villa.  Yet,  even  though  he  can  recite  Book  III  of  Virgil’s  <i class="calibre4">Georgics</i>  by  heart,  the Romans still treat him as though he’s semi-barbarian. He realises with frustration that he’ll never get a government appointment, or one of the really good seats in the amphitheatre. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>In  the  late  nineteenth  century,  many  educated  Indians  were taught  the  same lesson by their British masters. One famous anecdote tells of an ambitious Indian who  mastered  the  intricacies  of  the  English  language,  took  lessons  in  Western-style  dance,  and  even  became  accustomed  to  eating  with  a  knife  and  fork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equipped  with  his  new  manners,  he  travelled  to  England,  studied  law  at University College London, and became a quali ed barrister. Yet this young man of law, bedecked in suit and tie, was thrown o  a train in the British colony of South Africa for insisting on travelling  rst class instead of settling for third class, where  ‘coloured’  men  like  him  were  supposed  to  ride.  His  name  was  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In some cases the processes of acculturation and assimilation eventually broke down  the  barriers  between  the  newcomers  and  the  old  elite.  The  conquered  no longer saw the empire as an alien system of occupation, and the conquerors came to view their subjects as equal to themselves. Rulers and ruled alike came to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘them’ as ‘us’. All the subjects of Rome eventually, after centuries of imperial rule, were granted Roman citizenship. Non-Romans rose to occupy the top ranks in the o cer corps of the Roman legions and were appointed to the Senate. In AD 48 the emperor Claudius admitted to the Senate several Gallic notables, who, he noted in a speech, through ‘customs, culture, and the ties of marriage have blended with ourselves’. Snobbish senators protested introducing these former enemies into the heart of the Roman political system. Claudius reminded them of an inconvenient truth.  Most  of  their  own  senatorial  families  descended  from  Italian  tribes  who once fought against Rome, and were later granted Roman citizenship. Indeed, the emperor reminded them, his own family was of Sabine ancestry<a href="index_split_005.html#p359">.5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  second  century AD,  Rome  was  ruled  by  a  line  of  emperors  born  in Iberia, in whose veins probably  owed at least a few drops of local Iberian blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reigns of Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninius Pius and Marcus Aurelius are generally thought to constitute the empire’s golden age. After that, all the ethnic dams were let down. Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) was the scion of a Punic family from  Libya.  Elagabalus  (218–22)  was  a  Syrian.  Emperor  Philip  (244–9)  was known colloquially as ‘Philip the Arab’. The empire’s new citizens adopted Roman imperial  culture  with  such  zest  that,  for  centuries  and  even  millennia  after  the empire itself collapsed, they continued to speak the empire’s language, to believe in  the  Christian  God  that  the  empire  had  adopted  from  one  of  its  Levantine provinces, and to live by the empire’s laws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A similar process occurred in the Arab Empire. When it was established in the mid-seventh century AD, it was based on a sharp division between the ruling Arab–</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muslim  elite  and  the  subjugated  Egyptians,  Syrians,  Iranians  and  Berbers,  who were neither Arabs nor Muslim. Many of the empire’s subjects gradually adopted the Muslim faith, the Arabic language and a hybrid imperial culture. The old Arab</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>elite  looked  upon  these  parvenus  with  deep  hostility,  fearing  to  lose  its  unique status and identity. The frustrated converts clamoured for an equal share within the empire and in the world of Islam. Eventually they got their way. Egyptians, Syrians and Mesopotamians were increasingly seen as ‘Arabs’. Arabs, in their turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">– whether authentic’ Arabs from Arabia or newly minted Arabs from Egypt and Syria – came to be increasingly dominated by non-Arab Muslims, in particular by Iranians, Turks and Berbers. The great success of the Arab imperial project was that the imperial culture it created was wholeheartedly adopted by numerous non-Arab people, who continued to uphold it, develop it and spread it – even after the original empire collapsed and the Arabs as an ethnic group lost their dominion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In China the success of the imperial project was even more thorough. For more than 2,000 years, a welter of ethnic and cultural groups  rst termed barbarians were  successfully  integrated  into  imperial  Chinese  culture  and  became  Han Chinese (so named after the Han Empire that ruled China from 206 BC to AD 220). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ultimate achievement of the Chinese Empire is that it is still alive and kicking, yet  it  is  hard  to  see  it  as  an  empire  except  in  outlying  areas  such  as  Tibet  and Xinjiang.  More  than  90  per  cent  of  the  population  of  China  are  seen  by themselves and by others as Han. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  can  understand  the  decolonisation  process  of  the  last  few  decades  in  a similar way. During the modern era Europeans conquered much of the globe under the  guise  of  spreading  a  superior  Western  culture.  They  were  so  successful  that billions  of  people  gradually  adopted  signi cant  parts  of  that  culture.  Indians, Africans,  Arabs,  Chinese  and  Maoris  learned  French,  English  and  Spanish.  They began to believe in human rights and the principle of self-determination, and they adopted Western ideologies such as liberalism, capitalism, Communism, feminism and nationalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Imperial Cycle</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a><img src="index-176_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a><img src="index-177_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  twentieth  century,  local  groups  that  had  adopted  Western  values claimed equality with their European conquerors in the name of these very values. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many anti-colonial struggles were waged under the banners of self-determination, socialism and human rights, all of which are Western legacies. Just as Egyptians, Iranians and Turks adopted and adapted the imperial culture that they inherited from the original Arab conquerors, so today’s Indians, Africans and Chinese have accepted  much  of  the  imperial  culture  of  their  former  Western  overlords,  while seeking to mould it in accordance with their needs and traditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good Guys and Bad Guys in History</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  tempting  to  divide  history  neatly  into  good  guys  and  bad  guys,  with  all empires among the bad guys. For the vast majority of empires were founded on blood,  and  maintained  their  power  through  oppression  and  war.  Yet  most  of today’s cultures are based on imperial legacies. If empires are by de nition bad, what does that say about us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are schools of thought and political movements that seek to purge human culture  of  imperialism,  leaving  behind  what  they  claim  is  a  pure,  authentic civilisation,  untainted  by  sin.  These  ideologies  are  at  best  naïve;  at  worst  they serve as disingenuous window-dressing for crude nationalism and bigotry. Perhaps you could make a case that some of the myriad cultures that emerged at the dawn of  recorded  history  were  pure,  untouched  by  sin  and  unadulterated  by  other societies.  But  no  culture  since  that  dawn  can  reasonably  make  that  claim, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a><img src="index-178_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly no culture that exists now on earth. All human cultures are at least in part the legacy of empires and imperial civilisations, and no academic or political surgery can cut out the imperial legacies without killing the patient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think, for example, about the love-hate relationship between the independent Indian republic of today and the British Raj. The British conquest and occupation of  India  cost  the  lives  of  millions  of  Indians,  and  was  responsible  for  the continuous humiliation and exploitation of hundreds of millions more. Yet many Indians  adopted,  with  the  zest  of  converts,  Western  ideas  such  as  self-determination and human rights, and were dismayed when the British refused to live up to their own declared values by granting native Indians either equal rights as British subjects or independence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,  the  modern  Indian  state  is  a  child  of  the  British  Empire.  The British killed, injured and persecuted the inhabitants of the subcontinent, but they also united a bewildering mosaic of warring kingdoms, principalities and tribes, creating a shared national consciousness and a country that functioned more or less  as  a  single  political  unit.  They  laid  the  foundations  of  the  Indian  judicial system,  created  its  administrative  structure,  and  built  the  railroad  network  that was  critical  for  economic  integration.  Independent  India  adopted  Western democracy, in its British incarnation, as its form of government. English is still the subcontinent’s  lingua  franca,  a  neutral  tongue  that  native  speakers  of  Hindi, Tamil  and  Malayalam  can  use  to  communicate.  Indians  are  passionate  cricket players and chai (tea) drinkers, and both game and beverage are British legacies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commercial tea farming did not exist in India until the mid-nineteenth century, when  it  was  introduced  by  the  British  East  India  Company.  It  was  the  snobbish British sahibs who spread the custom of tea drinking throughout the subcontinent. </p>

A Hindu</b> <b class="calibre3">nationalist government changed the names of both city and station, but showed no appetite for razing</b> <b class="calibre3">such a magnificent building, even if it was built by foreign oppressors</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  many  Indians  today  would  want  to  call  a  vote  to  divest  themselves  of democracy, English, the railway network, the legal system, cricket and tea on the grounds that they are imperial legacies? And if they did, wouldn’t the very act of calling a vote to decide the issue demonstrate their debt to their former overlords? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  if  we  were  to  completely  disavow  the  legacy  of  a  brutal  empire  in  the hope of reconstructing and safeguarding the ‘authentic’ cultures that preceded it, in all probability what we will be defending is nothing but the legacy of an older and no less brutal empire. Those who resent the mutilation of Indian culture by the British Raj inadvertently sanctify the legacies of the Mughal Empire and the conquering sultanate of Delhi. And whoever attempts to rescue ‘authentic Indian culture’ from the alien in uences of these Muslim empires sancti es the legacies of the  Gupta  Empire,  the  Kushan  Empire  and  the  Maurya  Empire.  If  an  extreme Hindu nationalist were to destroy all the buildings left by the British conquerors, such  as  Mumbai’s  main  train  station,  what  about  the  structures  left  by  India’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>Muslim conquerors, such as the Taj Mahal? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody really knows how to solve this thorny question of cultural inheritance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever  path  we  take,  the  rst  step  is  to  acknowledge  the  complexity  of  the dilemma and to accept that simplistically dividing the past into good guys and bad guys  leads  nowhere.  Unless,  of  course,  we  are  willing  to  admit  that  we  usually follow the lead of the bad guys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The New Global Empire</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since around 200 BC, most humans have lived in empires. It seems likely that in the future, too, most humans will live in one. But this time the empire will be truly global. The imperial vision of dominion over the entire world could be imminent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the twenty- rst century unfolds, nationalism is fast losing ground. More and more  people  believe  that  all  of  humankind  is  the  legitimate  source  of  political authority,  rather  than  the  members  of  a  particular  nationality,  and  that safeguarding  human  rights  and  protecting  the  interests  of  the  entire  human species  should  be  the  guiding  light  of  politics.  If  so,  having  close  to  200</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent states is a hindrance rather than a help. Since Swedes, Indonesians and Nigerians deserve the same human rights, wouldn’t it be simpler for a single global government to safeguard them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The appearance of essentially global problems, such as melting ice caps, nibbles away  at  whatever  legitimacy  remains  to  the  independent  nation  states.  No sovereign state will be able to overcome global warming on its own. The Chinese Mandate of Heaven was given by Heaven to solve the problems of humankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  modern  Mandate  of  Heaven  will  be  given  by  humankind  to  solve  the problems of heaven, such as the hole in the ozone layer and the accumulation of greenhouse gases. The colour of the global empire may well be green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  of  2014,  the  world  is  still  politically  fragmented,  but  states  are  fast  losing their  independence.  Not  one  of  them  is  really  able  to  execute  independent economic policies, to declare and wage wars as it pleases, or even to run its own internal a airs as it sees  t. States are increasingly open to the machinations of global  markets,  to  the  interference  of  global  companies  and  NGOs,  and  to  the supervision of global public opinion and the international judicial system. States are obliged to conform to global standards of  nancial behaviour, environmental policy  and  justice.  Immensely  powerful  currents  of  capital,  labour  and information turn and shape the world, with a growing disregard for the borders and opinions of states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  global  empire  being  forged  before  our  eyes  is  not  governed  by  any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>particular state or ethnic group. Much like the Late Roman Empire, it is ruled by a multi-ethnic  elite,  and  is  held  together  by  a  common  culture  and  common interests. Throughout the world, more and more entrepreneurs, engineers, experts, scholars, lawyers and managers are called to join the empire. They must ponder whether  to  answer  the  imperial  call  or  to  remain  loyal  to  their  state  and  their people. More and more choose the empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a><b class="calibre3">12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Law of Religion</p>
<p class="calibre1">IN  THE  MEDIEVAL  MARKET  IN  SAMARKAND,  a  city  built  on  a  Central  Asian oasis, Syrian merchants ran their hands over  ne Chinese silks,  erce tribesmen from  the  steppes  displayed  the  latest  batch  of  straw-haired  slaves  from  the  far west, and shopkeepers pocketed shiny gold coins imprinted with exotic scripts and the  pro les  of  unfamiliar  kings.  Here,  at  one  of  that  era’s  major  crossroads between  east  and  west,  north  and  south,  the  uni cation  of  humankind  was  an everyday fact. The same process could be observed at work when Kublai Khan’s army  mustered  to  invade  Japan  in  1281.  Mongol  cavalrymen  in  skins  and  furs rubbed  shoulders  with  Chinese  foot  soldiers  in  bamboo  hats,  drunken  Korean auxiliaries picked  ghts with tattooed sailors from the South China Sea, engineers from  Central  Asia  listened  with  dropping  jaws  to  the  tall  tales  of  European adventurers, and all obeyed the command of a single emperor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  around  the  holy  Ka’aba  in  Mecca,  human  uni cation  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeding  by  other  means.  Had  you  been  a  pilgrim  to  Mecca,  circling  Islam’s holiest shrine in the year 1300, you might have found yourself in the company of a  party  from  Mesopotamia,  their  robes  oating  in  the  wind,  their  eyes  blazing with  ecstasy,  and  their  mouths  repeating  one  after  the  other  the  ninety-nine names of God. Just ahead you might have seen a weather-beaten Turkish patriarch from the Asian steppes, hobbling on a stick and stroking his beard thoughtfully. To one side, gold jewellery shining against jet-black skin, might have been a group of Muslims  from  the  African  kingdom  of  Mali.  The  aroma  of  clove,  turmeric, cardamom and sea salt would have signalled the presence of brothers from India, or perhaps from the mysterious spice islands further east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today religion is often considered a source of discrimination, disagreement and disunion.  Yet,  in  fact,  religion  has  been  the  third  great  uni er  of  humankind, alongside  money  and  empires.  Since  all  social  orders  and  hierarchies  are imagined, they are all fragile, and the larger the society, the more fragile it is. The crucial historical role of religion has been to give superhuman legitimacy to these fragile  structures.  Religions  assert  that  our  laws  are  not  the  result  of  human caprice, but are ordained by an absolute and supreme authority. This helps place at  least  some  fundamental  laws  beyond  challenge,  thereby  ensuring  social</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>stability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Religion  can  thus  be  de ned  as  <i class="calibre4">a  system  of  human  norms  and  values  that  is</i> <i class="calibre4">founded on a belief in a superhuman order</i>. This involves two distinct criteria: 1. Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not the product of human  whims  or  agreements.  Professional  football  is  not  a  religion,  because despite its many laws, rites and often bizarre rituals, everyone knows that human beings  invented  football  themselves,  and  FIFA  may  at  any  moment  enlarge  the size of the goal or cancel the offside rule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Based on this superhuman order, religion establishes norms and values that it considers  binding.  Many  Westerners  today  believe  in  ghosts,  fairies  and reincarnation,  but  these  beliefs  are  not  a  source  of  moral  and  behavioural standards. As such, they do not constitute a religion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite their ability to legitimise widespread social and political orders, not all religions  have  actuated  this  potential.  In  order  to  unite  under  its  aegis  a  large expanse  of  territory  inhabited  by  disparate  groups  of  human  beings,  a  religion must possess two further qualities. First, it must espouse a  <i class="calibre4">universal</i>  superhuman order that is true always and everywhere. Second, it must insist on spreading this belief to everyone. In other words, it must be universal and missionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The best-known religions of history, such as Islam and Buddhism, are universal and  missionary.  Consequently  people  tend  to  believe  that  all  religions  are  like them.  In  fact,  the  majority  of  ancient  religions  were  local  and  exclusive.  Their followers believed in local deities and spirits, and had no interest in converting the  entire human  race.  As  far  as  we  know,  universal  and  missionary  religions began to appear only in the  rst millennium BC. Their emergence was one of the most  important  revolutions  in  history,  and  made  a  vital  contribution  to  the uni cation  of  humankind,  much  like  the  emergence  of  universal  empires  and universal money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silencing the Lambs</p>
<p class="calibre1">When animism was the dominant belief system, human norms and values had to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take into consideration the outlook and interests of a multitude of other beings, such  as  animals,  plants,  fairies  and  ghosts.  For  example,  a  forager  band  in  the Ganges  Valley  may  have  established  a  rule  forbidding  people  to  cut  down  a particularly large  g tree, lest the  g-tree spirit become angry and take revenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another forager band living in the Indus Valley may have forbidden people from hunting white-tailed foxes, because a white-tailed fox once revealed to a wise old woman where the band might find precious obsidian. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>Such religions tended to be very local in outlook, and to emphasise the unique features of speci c locations, climates and phenomena. Most foragers spent their entire lives within an area of no more than a thousand square kilometres. In order to survive, the inhabitants of a particular valley needed to understand the superhuman order that regulated their valley, and to adjust their behaviour accordingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was pointless to try to convince the inhabitants of some distant valley to follow the same rules. The people of the Indus did not bother to send missionaries to the Ganges to convince locals not to hunt white-tailed foxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Agricultural  Revolution  seems  to  have  been  accompanied  by  a  religious revolution. Hunter-gatherers picked and pursued wild plants and animals, which could be seen as equal in status to  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. The fact that man hunted sheep did not make sheep inferior to man, just as the fact that tigers hunted man did not make man inferior to tigers. Beings communicated with one another directly and negotiated  the  rules  governing  their  shared  habitat.  In  contrast,  farmers  owned and  manipulated  plants  and  animals,  and  could hardly  degrade  themselves  by negotiating  with  their  possessions.  Hence  the  rst  religious  e ect  of  the Agricultural Revolution was to turn plants and animals from equal members of a spiritual round table into property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This,  however,  created  a  big  problem.  Farmers  may  have  desired  absolute control of their sheep, but they knew perfectly well that their control was limited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They could lock the sheep in pens, castrate rams and selectively breed ewes, yet they could not ensure that the ewes conceived and gave birth to healthy lambs, nor could they prevent the eruption of deadly epidemics. How then to safeguard the fecundity of the flocks? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  leading  theory  about  the  origin  of  the  gods  argues  that  gods  gained importance  because  they  o ered  a  solution  to  this  problem.  Gods  such  as  the fertility  goddess,  the  sky  god  and  the  god  of  medicine  took  centre  stage  when plants  and  animals  lost  their  ability  to  speak,  and  the  gods’  main  role  was  to mediate  between  humans  and  the  mute  plants  and  animals.  Much  of  ancient mythology  is  in  fact  a  legal  contract  in  which  humans  promise  everlasting devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals – the  rst chapters of the book of Genesis are a prime example. For thousands of years after the  Agricultural  Revolution,  religious  liturgy  consisted  mainly  of  humans sacri cing  lambs,  wine  and  cakes  to  divine  powers,  who  in  exchange  promised abundant harvests and fecund flocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Agricultural Revolution initially had a far smaller impact on the status of other members of the animist system, such as rocks, springs, ghosts and demons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  these  too  gradually  lost  status  in  favour  of  the  new  gods.  As  long  as people lived their entire lives within limited territories of a few hundred square kilometres, most of their needs could be met by local spirits. But once kingdoms</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>and trade networks expanded, people needed to contact entities whose power and authority encompassed a whole kingdom or an entire trade basin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  attempt  to  answer  these  needs  led  to  the  appearance  of  polytheistic religions (from the Greek:  <i class="calibre4">poly</i> = many,  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> = god). These religions understood the  world  to  be  controlled  by  a  group  of  powerful  gods,  such  as  the  fertility goddess, the rain god and the war god. Humans could appeal to these gods and the  gods  might,  if  they received  devotions  and  sacri ces,  deign  to  bring  rain, victory and health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Animism  did  not  entirely  disappear  at  the  advent  of  polytheism.  Demons, fairies, ghosts, holy rocks, holy springs and holy trees remained an integral part of almost all polytheist religions. These spirits were far less important than the great gods,  but  for  the  mundane  needs  of  many  ordinary  people,  they  were  good enough. While the king in his capital city sacri ced dozens of fat rams to the great war  god,  praying  for  victory  over  the  barbarians,  the  peasant  in  his  hut  lit  a candle to the fig-tree fairy, praying that she help cure his sick son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet the greatest impact of the rise of great gods was not on sheep or demons, but upon the status of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. Animists thought that humans were just one of  many  creatures  inhabiting  the  world.  Polytheists,  on  the  other  hand, increasingly saw the world as a re ection of the relationship between gods and humans. Our prayers, our sacri ces, our sins and our good deeds determined the fate  of  the  entire  ecosystem.  A  terrible  ood  might  wipe  out  billions  of  ants, grasshoppers, turtles, antelopes, gira es and elephants, just because a few stupid Sapiens made the gods angry. Polytheism thereby exalted not only the status of the gods, but also that of humankind. Less fortunate members of the old animist system  lost  their  stature  and  became  either  extras  or  silent  decor  in  the  great drama of man’s relationship with the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Benefits of Idolatry</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two thousand years of monotheistic brainwashing have caused most Westerners to see polytheism as ignorant and childish idolatry. This is an unjust stereotype. In order  to  understand  the  inner  logic  of  polytheism,  it  is  necessary  to  grasp  the central idea buttressing the belief in many gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power or law governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religions recognised  such  a  supreme  power  that  stands  behind  all  the  di erent  gods, demons  and  holy  rocks.  In  classical  Greek  polytheism,  Zeus,  Hera,  Apollo  and their colleagues were subject to an omnipotent and all-encompassing power – Fate</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>(Moira, Ananke). Nordic gods, too, were in thrall to fate, which doomed them to perish in the cataclysm of Ragnarök (the Twilight of the Gods). In the polytheistic religion  of  the  Yoruba  of  West  Africa,  all  gods  were  born  of  the  supreme  god Olodumare, and remained subject to him. In Hindu polytheism, a single principle, Atman, controls the myriad gods and spirits, humankind, and the biological and physical world. Atman is the eternal essence or soul of the entire universe, as well as of every individual and every phenomenon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and  therefore  it  is  unconcerned  with  the  mundane  desires,  cares  and  worries  of humans. It’s pointless to ask this power for victory in war, for health or for rain, because from its all-encompassing vantage point, it makes no di erence whether a particular kingdom wins or loses, whether a particular city prospers or withers, whether  a  particular  person  recuperates  or  dies.  The  Greeks  did  not  waste  any sacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to Atman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  only  reason  to  approach  the  supreme  power  of  the  universe  would  be  to renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good – to embrace even defeat,  poverty,  sickness  and  death.  Thus  some  Hindus,  known  as  Sadhus  or Sannyasis,  devote  their  lives  to  uniting  with  Atman,  thereby  achieving enlightenment.  They  strive  to  see  the  world  from  the  viewpoint  of  this fundamental  principle,  to  realise  that  from  its  eternal  perspective  all  mundane desires and fears are meaningless and ephemeral phenomena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  Hindus,  however,  are  not  Sadhus.  They  are  sunk  deep  in  the  morass  of mundane concerns, where Atman is not much help. For assistance in such matters, Hindus  approach  the  gods  with  their  partial  powers.  Precisely  because  their powers are partial rather than all-encompassing, gods such as Ganesha, Lakshmi and Saraswati have interests and biases. Humans can therefore make deals with these partial powers and rely on their help in order to win wars and recuperate from illness. There are necessarily many of these smaller powers, since once you start  dividing  up  the  all-encompassing  power of  a  supreme  principle,  you’ll inevitably end up with more than one deity. Hence the plurality of gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The insight of polytheism is conducive to far-reaching religious tolerance. Since polytheists believe, on the one hand, in one supreme and completely disinterested power,  and  on  the  other  hand  in  many  partial  and  biased  powers,  there  is  no di culty for the devotees of one god to accept the existence and e cacy of other gods. Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes ‘heretics’ and</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘infidels’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when polytheists conquered huge empires, they did not try to convert their subjects. The Egyptians, the Romans and the Aztecs did not send missionaries to foreign lands to spread the worship of Osiris, Jupiter or Huitzilopochtli (the chief</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>Aztec  god),  and  they  certainly  didn’t  dispatch  armies  for  that  purpose.  Subject peoples  throughout  the  empire  were  expected  to  respect  the  empire’s  gods  and rituals, since these gods and rituals protected and legitimised the empire. Yet they were  not  required  to  give  up  their  local  gods  and  rituals.  In  the  Aztec  Empire, subject  peoples  were  obliged  to  build  temples  for  Huitzilopochtli,  but  these temples  were  built  alongside  those  of  local  gods,  rather  than  in  their  stead.  In many cases the imperial elite itself adopted the gods and rituals of subject people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Romans  happily  added  the  Asian  goddess  Cybele  and  the  Egyptian  goddess Isis to their pantheon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only god that the Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheistic and evangelising  god  of  the  Christians.  The  Roman  Empire  did  not  require  the Christians to give up their beliefs and rituals, but it did expect them to pay respect to the empire’s protector gods and to the divinity of the emperor. This was seen as a declaration of political loyalty. When the Christians vehemently refused to do so,  and  went  on  to  reject  all  attempts  at  compromise,  the  Romans  reacted  by persecuting what they understood to be a politically subversive faction. And even this was done half-heartedly. In the 300 years from the cruci xion of Christ to the conversion  of  Emperor  Constantine,  polytheistic  Roman  emperors  initiated  no more  than  four  general  persecutions  of  Christians.  Local  administrators  and governors incited some anti-Christian violence of their own. Still, if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries, the  polytheistic  Romans  killed  no  more  than  a  few  thousand  Christians. <a href="index_split_005.html#p359">1  </a>In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly di erent interpretations of the religion of love and compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious. All those involved accepted Christ’s divinity and His gospel of compassion and love. However, they disagreed about the nature of this love. Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in  esh and allowed Himself to be tortured and cruci ed, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all  those  who  professed  faith  in  Him.  Catholics  maintained  that  faith,  while essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds. Protestants refused to accept this, arguing that this quid pro quo belittles God’s greatness and love. Whoever thinks that entry to heaven depends  upon  his  or  her  own  good  deeds  magni es  his  own  importance,  and implies that Christ’s su ering on the cross and God’s love for humankind are not enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  theological  disputes  turned  so  violent  that  during  the  sixteenth  and seventeenth centuries, Catholics and Protestants killed each other by the hundreds</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>of thousands. On 23 August 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good  deeds  attacked  communities  of  French  Protestants  who  highlighted  God’s love for humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, between 5,000  and  10,000  Protestants  were  slaughtered  in  less  than  twenty-four  hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the pope in Rome heard the news from France, he was so overcome by joy that  he  organised  festive  prayers  to  celebrate  the  occasion  and  commissioned Giorgio  Vasari  to  decorate  one  of  the  Vatican’s  rooms  with  a  fresco  of  the massacre (the room is currently o -limits to visitors). <a href="index_split_005.html#p359">2</a> More Christians were killed by  fellow  Christians  in  those  twenty-four  hours  than  by  the  polytheistic  Roman Empire throughout its entire existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God is One</p>
<p class="calibre1">With  time  some  followers  of  polytheist  gods  became  so  fond  of  their  particular patron  that  they  drifted  away  from  the  basic  polytheist  insight.  They  began  to believe  that  their  god  was  the  only  god,  and  that  He  was  in  fact  the  supreme power  of  the  universe.  Yet  at  the  same  time  they  continued  to  view  Him  as possessing interests and biases, and believed that they could strike deals with Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus were born monotheist religions, whose followers beseech the supreme power of the universe to help them recover from illness, win the lottery and gain victory in war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst  monotheist  religion  known  to  us  appeared  in  Egypt,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.350 BC,  when Pharaoh  Akhenaten  declared  that  one  of  the  minor  deities  of  the  Egyptian pantheon,  the  god  Aten,  was,  in  fact,  the  supreme  power  ruling  the  universe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Akhenaten institutionalised the worship of Aten as the state religion and tried to check  the  worship  of  all  other  gods.  His  religious  revolution,  however,  was unsuccessful. After his death, the worship of Aten was abandoned in favour of the old pantheon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polytheism continued to give birth here and there to other monotheist religions, but  they  remained  marginal,  not  least  because  they  failed  to  digest  their  own universal message. Judaism, for example, argued that the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, yet His chief interest is in the tiny Jewish nation and  in  the  obscure  land  of  Israel.  Judaism  had  little  to  o er  other  nations,  and throughout most of its existence it has not been a missionary religion. This stage can be called the stage of ‘local monotheism’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  big  breakthrough  came  with  Christianity.  This  faith  began  as  an  esoteric Jewish sect that sought to convince Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-awaited messiah. However, one of the sect’s  rst leaders, Paul of Tarsus, reasoned</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>that if the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, and if He had bothered to incarnate Himself in the  esh and to die on the cross for the salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about, not just Jews. It was thus necessary to spread the good word – the gospel – about Jesus throughout the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul’s arguments fell on fertile ground. Christians began organising widespread missionary activities aimed at all humans. In one of history’s strangest twists, this esoteric Jewish sect took over the mighty Roman Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian  success  served  as  a  model  for  another  monotheist  religion  that appeared  in  the  Arabian  peninsula  in  the  seventh  century  –  Islam.  Like Christianity, Islam, too, began as a small sect in a remote corner of the world, but in an even stranger and swifter historical surprise it managed to break out of the deserts  of  Arabia  and  conquer  an  immense  empire  stretching  from  the  Atlantic Ocean  to  India.  Henceforth,  the  monotheist  idea  played  a  central  role  in  world history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monotheists  have  tended  to  be  far  more  fanatical  and  missionary  than polytheists. A religion that recognises the legitimacy of other faiths implies either that its god is not the supreme power of the universe, or that it received from God just part of the universal truth. Since monotheists have usually believed that they are in possession of the entire message of the one and only God, they have been compelled to discredit all other religions. Over the last two millennia, monotheists repeatedly  tried  to  strengthen  their  hand  by  violently  exterminating  all competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  worked.  At  the  beginning  of  the  rst  century AD,  there  were  hardly  any monotheists in the world. Around AD 500, one of the world’s largest empires – the Roman  Empire  –  was  a  Christian  polity,  and  missionaries  were  busy  spreading Christianity  to  other  parts  of  Europe,  Asia  and  Africa.  By  the  end  of  the  rst millennium AD,  most  people  in  Europe,  West  Asia  and  North  Africa  were monotheists, and empires from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalayas claimed to be ordained  by  the  single  great  God.  By  the  early  sixteenth  century,  monotheism dominated  most  of  Afro-Asia,  with  the  exception  of  East  Asia  and  the  southern parts  of  Africa,  and  it  began  extending  long  tentacles  towards  South  Africa, America  and  Oceania.  Today  most  people  outside  East  Asia  adhere  to  one monotheist  religion  or  another,  and  the  global  political  order  is  built  on monotheistic foundations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  just  as  animism  continued  to  survive  within  polytheism,  so  polytheism continued  to  survive  within  monotheism.  In  theory,  once  a  person  believes  that the  supreme  power  of  the  universe  has  interests  and  biases,  what’s  the  point  in worshipping  partial  powers?  Who  would  want  to  approach  a  lowly  bureaucrat when the president’s o ce is open to you? Indeed, monotheist theology tends to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a><img src="index-190_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">deny the existence of all gods except the supreme God, and to pour hell re and brimstone over anyone who dares worship them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Map 5. The Spread of Christianity and Islam</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet there has always been a chasm between theological theories and historical realities. Most people have found it di cult to digest the monotheist idea fully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  have  continued  to  divide  the  world  into  ‘we’  and  ‘they’,  and  to  see  the supreme power of the universe as too distant and alien for their mundane needs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  monotheist  religions  expelled  the  gods  through  the  front  door  with  a  lot  of fanfare,  only  to  take  them  back  in  through  the  side  window.  Christianity,  for example,  developed  its  own  pantheon  of  saints,  whose  cults  di ered  little  from those of the polytheistic gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as the god Jupiter defended Rome and Huitzilopochtli protected the Aztec Empire,  so  every  Christian  kingdom  had  its  own patron  saint  who  helped  it overcome di culties and win wars. England was protected by St George, Scotland by  St  Andrew,  Hungary  by  St  Stephen,  and  France  had  St  Martin.  Cities  and towns,  professions,  and  even  diseases  –  each  had  their  own  saint.  The  city  of Milan had St Ambrose, while St Mark watched over Venice. St Florian protected chimney cleaners, whereas St Mathew lent a hand to tax collectors in distress. If you  su ered  from  headaches  you  had  to  pray  to  St  Agathius,  but  if  from toothaches, then St Apollonia was a much better audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Christian  saints  did  not  merely  resemble  the  old  polytheistic  gods.  Often</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>they  were  these  very  same  gods  in  disguise.  For  example,  the  chief  goddess  of Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was Christianised, Brigid too was baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the most revered saint in Catholic Ireland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Battle of Good and Evil</p>
<p class="calibre1">Polytheism  gave  birth  not  merely  to  monotheist  religions,  but  also  to  dualistic ones. Dualistic religions espouse the existence of two opposing powers: good and evil.  Unlike  monotheism,  dualism  believes  that  evil  is  an  independent  power, neither created by the good God, nor subordinate to it. Dualism explains that the entire  universe  is  a  battleground  between  these  two  forces,  and  that  everything that happens in the world is part of the struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dualism  is  a  very  attractive  world  view  because  it  has  a  short  and  simple answer to the famous Problem of Evil, one of the fundamental concerns of human thought.  ‘Why  is  there  evil  in  the  world?  Why  is  there  su ering?  Why  do  bad things  happen  to  good  people?’  Monotheists  have  to  practise  intellectual gymnastics to explain how an all-knowing, all-powerful and perfectly good God allows so much su ering in the world. One well-known explanation is that this is God’s way of allowing for human free will. Were there no evil, humans could not choose  between  good  and  evil,  and  hence  there  would  be  no  free  will.  This, however,  is  a  non-intuitive  answer  that  immediately  raises  a  host  of  new questions. Freedom of will allows humans to choose evil. Many indeed choose evil and, according to the standard monotheist account, this choice must bring divine punishment in its wake. If God knew in advance that a particular person would use her free will to choose evil, and that as a result she would be punished for this by  eternal  tortures  in  hell,  why  did  God  create  her?  Theologians  have  written countless  books  to  answer  such  questions.  Some  nd  the  answers  convincing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some don’t. What’s undeniable is that monotheists have a hard time dealing with the Problem of Evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For dualists, it’s easy to explain evil. Bad things happen even to good people because  the  world  is  not  governed  single-handedly  by  a  good  God.  There  is  an independent evil power loose in the world. The evil power does bad things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dualism  has  its  own  drawbacks.  While  solving  the  Problem  of  Evil,  it  is unnerved by the Problem of Order. If the world was created by a single God, it’s clear why it is such an orderly place, where everything obeys the same laws. But if Good and Evil battle for control of the world, who enforces the laws governing this  cosmic  war?  Two  rival  states  can  ght  one  another  because  both  obey  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>same  laws  of  physics.  A  missile  launched  from  Pakistan  can  hit  targets  in  India because gravity works the same way in both countries. When Good and Evil  ght, what common laws do they obey, and who decreed these laws? </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, monotheism explains order, but is mysti ed by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dualistic religions  ourished for more than a thousand years. Sometime between 1500 BC  and  1000 BC  a  prophet  named  Zoroaster  (Zarathustra)  was  active somewhere in Central Asia. His creed passed from generation to generation until it became the most important of dualistic religions – Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians saw the world as a cosmic battle between the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil god  Angra  Mainyu.  Humans  had  to  help  the  good  god  in  this  battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zoroastrianism was an important religion during the Achaemenid Persian Empire (550–330 BC) and later became the o cial religion of the Sassanid Persian Empire (AD 224–651). It exerted a major influence on almost all subsequent Middle Eastern and Central Asian religions, and it inspired a number of other dualist religions, such as Gnosticism and Manichaeanism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  third  and  fourth  centuries AD,  the  Manichaean  creed  spread  from China  to  North  Africa,  and  for  a  moment  it  appeared  that  it  would  beat Christianity to achieve dominance in the Roman Empire. Yet the Manichaeans lost the soul of Rome to the Christians, the Zoroastrian Sassanid Empire was overrun by the monotheistic Muslims, and the dualist wave subsided. Today only a handful of dualist communities survive in India and the Middle East. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,  the  rising  tide  of  monotheism  did  not  really  wipe  out  dualism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish, Christian and Muslim monotheism absorbed numerous dualist beliefs and practices, and some of the most basic ideas of what we call ‘monotheism’ are, in fact, dualist in origin and spirit. Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in a powerful evil force – like the one Christians call the Devil or Satan – who can act  independently,  ght  against  the  good  God,  and  wreak  havoc  without  God’s permission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How can a monotheist adhere to such a dualistic belief (which, by the way, is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament)? Logically, it is impossible. Either you believe  in  a  single  omnipotent  God  or  you  believe  in  two  opposing  powers, neither of which is omnipotent. Still, humans have a wonderful capacity to believe in  contradictions.  So  it  should  not  come  as  a  surprise  that  millions  of  pious Christians, Muslims and Jews manage to believe at one and the same time in an omnipotent  God  and  an  independent  Devil.  Countless  Christians,  Muslims  and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>Jews have gone so far as to imagine that the good God even needs our help in its struggle against the Devil, which inspired among other things the call for jihads and crusades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another key dualistic concept, particularly in Gnosticism and Manichaeanism, was  the  sharp  distinction  between  body  and  soul,  between  matter  and  spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gnostics  and  Manichaeans  argued  that  the  good  god  created  the  spirit  and  the soul, whereas matter and bodies are the creation of the evil god. Man, according to this view, serves as a battleground between the good soul and the evil body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  a  monotheistic  perspective,  this  is  nonsense  –  why  distinguish  so  sharply between body and soul, or matter and spirit? And why argue that body and matter are evil? After all, everything was created by the same good God. But monotheists could  not  help  but  be  captivated  by  dualist  dichotomies,  precisely  because  they helped them address the problem of evil. So such oppositions eventually became cornerstones of Christian and Muslim thought. Belief in heaven (the realm of the good god) and hell (the realm of the evil god) was also dualist in origin. There is no trace of this belief in the Old Testament, which also never claims that the souls of people continue to live after the death of the body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  monotheism,  as  it  has  played  out  in  history,  is  a  kaleidoscope  of monotheist,  dualist,  polytheist  and  animist  legacies,  jumbling  together  under  a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also  in  the  dualist  Devil,  in  polytheist  saints,  and  in  animist  ghosts.  Scholars  of religion  have  a  name  for  this  simultaneous  avowal  of  di erent  and  even contradictory  ideas  and  the  combination  of  rituals  and  practices  taken  from di erent  sources.  It’s  called  syncretism.  Syncretism  might,  in  fact,  be  the  single great world religion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Law of Nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">All the religions we have discussed so far share one important characteristic: they all focus on a belief in gods and other supernatural entities. This seems obvious to Westerners, who are familiar mainly with monotheistic and polytheist creeds. In fact, however, the religious history of the world does not boil down to the history of gods. During the  rst millennium BC, religions of an altogether new kind began to  spread  through  Afro-Asia.  The  newcomers,  such  as  Jainism  and  Buddhism  in India,  Daoism  and  Confucianism  in  China,  and  Stoicism,  Cynicism  and Epicureanism in the Mediterranean basin, were characterised by their disregard of gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These creeds maintained that the superhuman order governing the world is the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>product  of  natural  laws  rather  than  of  divine  wills  and  whims.  Some  of  these natural-law  religions  continued  to espouse  the  existence  of  gods,  but  their  gods were subject to the laws of nature no less than humans, animals and plants were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gods had their niche in the ecosystem, just as elephants and porcupines had theirs, but could no more change the laws of nature than elephants can. A prime example is  Buddhism,  the  most  important  of  the  ancient  natural  law  religions,  which remains one of the major faiths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  central  gure  of  Buddhism  is  not  a  god  but  a  human  being,  Siddhartha Gautama.  According  to  Buddhist  tradition,  Gautama  was  heir  to  a  small Himalayan  kingdom,  sometime  around  500 BC.  The  young  prince  was  deeply a ected by the su ering evident all around him. He saw that men and women, </p>
<p class="calibre1">children and old people, all su er not just from occasional calamities such as war and plague, but also from anxiety, frustration and discontent, all of which seem to be an inseparable part of the human condition. People pursue wealth and power, acquire  knowledge  and  possessions,  beget  sons  and  daughters,  and  build  houses and palaces. Yet no matter what they achieve, they are never content. Those who live in poverty dream of riches. Those who have a million want two million. Those who  have  two  million  want  10  million.  Even  the  rich  and  famous  are  rarely satis ed. They too are haunted by ceaseless cares and worries, until sickness, old age  and  death  put  a  bitter  end  to  them.  Everything  that  one  has  accumulated vanishes like smoke. Life is a pointless rat race. But how to escape it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the age of twenty-nine Gautama slipped away from his palace in the middle of the night, leaving behind his family and possessions. He travelled as a homeless vagabond  throughout  northern  India,  searching  for  a  way  out  of  su ering.  He visited ashrams and sat at the feet of gurus but nothing liberated him entirely –</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  dissatisfaction  always  remained.  He  did  not  despair.  He  resolved  to investigate su ering on his own until he found a method for complete liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He spent six years meditating on the essence, causes and cures for human anguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end he came to the realisation that su ering is not caused by ill fortune, by social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, su ering is caused by the behaviour patterns of one’s own mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gautama’s  insight  was  that  no  matter  what  the  mind  experiences,  it  usually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction. When the mind experiences  something  distasteful  it  craves  to  be  rid  of  the  irritation.  When  the mind experiences something pleasant, it craves that the pleasure will remain and will intensify. Therefore, the mind is always dissatis ed and restless. This is very clear  when  we  experience  unpleasant  things,  such  as  pain.  As  long  as  the  pain continues, we are dissatis ed and do all we can to avoid it. Yet even when we experience pleasant things we are never content. We either fear that the pleasure might disappear, or we hope that it will intensify. People dream for years about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a><img src="index-195_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">nding love but are rarely satis ed when they  nd it. Some become anxious that their partner will leave; others feel that they have settled cheaply, and could have found someone better. And we all know people who manage to do both. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Map 6. The Spread of Buddhism</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great  gods  can  send  us  rain,  social  institutions  can  provide  justice  and  good health care, and lucky coincidences can turn us into millionaires, but none of them can change our basic mental patterns. Hence even the greatest kings are doomed to live in angst, constantly  eeing grief and anguish, forever chasing after greater pleasures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gautama  found  that  there  was  a  way  to  exit  this  vicious  circle.  If,  when  the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no su ering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not su er from it.  There  can  actually  be  richness  in  the  sadness.  If  you  experience  joy  without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving? To accept sadness as sadness, joy as joy, pain as pain? Gautama developed a set of meditation  techniques  that  train  the  mind  to  experience  reality  as  it  is,  without craving. These practices train the mind to focus all its attention on the question, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>‘What  am  I  experiencing  now?’  rather  than  on  ‘What  would  I  rather  be experiencing?’ It is difficult to achieve this state of mind, but not impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gautama grounded these meditation techniques in a set of ethical rules meant to make it easier for people to focus on actual experience and to avoid falling into cravings and fantasies. He instructed his followers to avoid killing, promiscuous sex and theft, since such acts necessarily stoke the  re of craving (for power, for sensual  pleasure,  or  for  wealth).  When  the  ames  are  completely  extinguished, craving  is  replaced  by  a  state  of  perfect  contentment  and  serenity,  known  as nirvana (the literal meaning of which is ‘extinguishing the  re’). Those who have attained  nirvana  are  fully  liberated  from  all  su ering.  They  experience  reality with the utmost clarity, free of fantasies and delusions. While they will most likely still encounter unpleasantness and pain, such experiences cause them no misery. A person who does not crave cannot suffer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  Buddhist  tradition,  Gautama  himself  attained  nirvana  and  was fully liberated from su ering. Henceforth he was known as ‘Buddha’, which means</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The Enlightened One’. Buddha spent the rest of his life explaining his discoveries to  others  so  that  everyone  could  be  freed  from  su ering.  He  encapsulated  his teachings in a single law: su ering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from su ering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This law, known as  <i class="calibre4">dharma</i> or  <i class="calibre4">dhamma</i>, is seen by Buddhists as a universal law of nature. That ‘su ering arises from craving’ is always and everywhere true, just as  in  modern  physics  <i class="calibre4">E</i>  always  equals  <i class="calibre4">mc2</i>.  Buddhists  are  people  who  believe  in this law and make it the fulcrum of all their activities. Belief in gods, on the other hand, is of minor importance to them. The  rst principle of monotheist religions is</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘God  exists.  What  does  He  want  from  me?’  The  rst  principle  of  Buddhism  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Suffering exists. How do I escape it?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Buddhism does not deny the existence of gods – they are described as powerful beings who can bring rains and victories – but they have no in uence on the law that su ering arises from craving. If the mind of a person is free of all craving, no god can make him miserable. Conversely, once craving arises in a person’s mind, all the gods in the universe cannot save him from suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet much like the monotheist religions, premodern natural-law religions such as Buddhism  never  really  rid  themselves  of  the  worship  of  gods.  Buddhism  told people  that  they  should  aim  for  the  ultimate  goal  of  complete  liberation  from su ering,  rather  than  for  stops  along  the  way  such  as  economic  prosperity  and political  power.  However,  99  per  cent  of  Buddhists  did  not  attain  nirvana,  and even  if  they  hoped  to  do  so  in  some  future  lifetime,  they  devoted  most  of  their present  lives  to  the  pursuit  of  mundane  achievements.  So  they  continued  to worship various gods, such as the Hindu gods in India, the Bon gods in Tibet, and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>the Shinto gods in Japan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  as  time  went  by  several  Buddhist  sects  developed  pantheons  of Buddhas  and  bodhisattvas.  These  are  human  and  non-human  beings  with  the capacity to achieve full liberation from suffering but who forego this liberation out of compassion, in order to help the countless beings still trapped in the cycle of misery.  Instead  of  worshipping  gods,  many  Buddhists  began  worshipping  these enlightened beings, asking them for help not only in attaining nirvana, but also in dealing  with  mundane  problems.  Thus  we  nd  many  Buddhas  and  bodhisattvas throughout East Asia who spend their time bringing rain, stopping plagues, and even winning bloody wars – in exchange for prayers, colourful  owers, fragrant incense and gifts of rice and candy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Worship of Man</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last 300 years are often depicted as an age of growing secularism, in which religions  have  increasingly  lost  their  importance.  If  we  are  talking  about  theist religions,  this  is  largely  correct.  But  if  we  take  into  consideration  natural-law religions,  then  modernity  turns  out  to  be  an  age  of  intense  religious  fervour, unparalleled missionary e orts, and the bloodiest wars of religion in history. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Islam  is  of  course  di erent  from  Communism,  because  Islam  sees  the superhuman order governing the world as the edict of an omnipotent creator god, whereas Soviet Communism did not believe in gods. But Buddhism too gives short shrift  to  gods,  and  yet  we  commonly  classify  it  as  a  religion.  Like  Buddhists, Communists believed in a superhuman order of natural and immutable laws that should guide human actions. Whereas Buddhists believe that the law of nature was discovered  by  Siddhartha  Gautama,  Communists  believed  that  the  law  of  nature was  discovered  by  Karl  Marx,  Friedrich  Engels  and  Vladimir  Ilyich  Lenin.  The similarity  does  not  end  there.  Like  other  religions,  Communism  too  has  its  holy scripts and prophetic books, such as Marx’s  <i class="calibre4">Das Kapital</i>, which foretold that history would soon end with the inevitable victory of the proletariat. Communism had its holidays and festivals, such as the First of May and the anniversary of the October Revolution. It had theologians adept at Marxist dialectics, and every unit in the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a><img src="index-198_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Soviet  army  had  a  chaplain,  called  a  commissar,  who  monitored  the  piety  of soldiers  and  o cers.  Communism  had  martyrs,  holy  wars  and  heresies,  such  as Trotskyism. Soviet Communism was a fanatical and missionary religion. A devout Communist could not be a Christian or a Buddhist, and was expected to spread the gospel of Marx and Lenin even at the price of his or her life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order. The</b> <b class="calibre3">theory of relativity is not a religion, because (at least so far) there are no human norms and values that</b> <b class="calibre3">are founded on it. Football is not a religion because nobody argues that its rules reflect superhuman</b> <b class="calibre3">edicts. Islam, Buddhism and Communism are all religions, because all are systems of human norms and</b> <b class="calibre3">values that are founded on belief in a superhuman order. (Note the difference between ‘superhuman’ and</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">‘supernatural’. The Buddhist law of nature and the Marxist laws of history are superhuman, since they</b> <b class="calibre3">were not legislated by humans. Yet they are not supernatural.)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  readers  may  feel  very  uncomfortable  with  this  line  of  reasoning.  If  it makes  you  feel  better,  you  are  free  to  go  on  calling  Communism  an  ideology rather  than  a  religion.  It  makes  no  di erence.  We  can  divide  creeds  into  god-centred religions and godless ideologies that claim to be based on natural laws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  then,  to  be  consistent,  we  would  need  to  catalogue  at  least  some  Buddhist, Daoist and Stoic sects as ideologies rather than religions. Conversely, we should note that belief in gods persists within many modern ideologies, and that some of them, most notably liberalism, make little sense without this belief. </p>
