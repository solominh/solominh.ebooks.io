<p class="calibre1">It would be impossible to survey here the history of all the new modern creeds, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>especially because there are no clear boundaries between them. They are no less syncretic  than  monotheism  and  popular  Buddhism.  Just  as  a  Buddhist  could worship Hindu deities, and just as a monotheist could believe in the existence of Satan,  so  the  typical  American  nowadays  is  simultaneously  a  nationalist  (she believes  in  the  existence  of  an  American  nation  with  a  special  role  to  play  in history),  a  free-market  capitalist  (she  believes  that  open  competition  and  the pursuit  of  self-interest  are  the  best  ways  to  create  a  prosperous  society),  and  a liberal  humanist  (she  believes  that  humans  have  been  endowed  by  their  creator with  certain  inalienable  rights).  Nationalism  will  be  discussed  in <a href="index_split_005.html#p298">Chapter  18</a>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Capitalism – the most successful of the modern religions – gets a whole chapter, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_004.html#p261">Chapter  16, </a>  which  expounds  its  principal  beliefs  and  rituals.  In  the  remaining pages of this chapter I will address the humanist religions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theist  religions  focus  on  the  worship  of  gods.  Humanist  religions  worship humanity,  or  more  correctly,  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>.  Humanism  is  a  belief  that  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i> has a unique and sacred nature, which is fundamentally di erent from the nature of all other animals and of all other phenomena. Humanists believe that the unique nature of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> is the most important thing in the world, and it determines the meaning of everything that happens in the universe. The supreme good is the good of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. The rest of the world and all other beings exist solely for the benefit of this species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  humanists  worship  humanity,  but  they  do  not  agree  on  its  de nition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humanism  has  split  into  three  rival  sects  that  ght  over  the  exact  de nition  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘humanity’,  just  as  rival  Christian  sects  fought  over  the  exact  de nition  of  God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, the most important humanist sect is liberal humanism, which believes that</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘humanity’ is a quality of individual humans, and that the liberty of individuals is therefore sacrosanct. According to liberals, the sacred nature of humanity resides within  each  and  every  individual  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>.  The  inner  core  of  individual humans gives meaning to the world, and is the source for all ethical and political authority. If we encounter an ethical or political dilemma, we should look inside and listen to our inner voice – the voice of humanity. The chief commandments of liberal  humanism  are  meant  to  protect  the  liberty  of  this inner  voice  against intrusion or harm. These commandments are collectively known as ‘human rights’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This,  for  example,  is  why  liberals  object  to  torture  and  the  death  penalty.  In early  modern  Europe,  murderers  were  thought  to  violate  and  destabilise  the cosmic order. To bring the cosmos back to balance, it was necessary to torture and publicly execute the criminal, so that everyone could see the order re-established. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Attending  gruesome  executions  was  a  favourite  pastime  for  Londoners  and Parisians in the era of Shakespeare and Molière. In today’s Europe, murder is seen as a violation of the sacred nature of humanity. In order to restore order, present-day  Europeans  do  not  torture  and  execute  criminals.  Instead,  they  punish  a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>murderer in what they see as the most ‘humane’ way possible, thus safeguarding and even rebuilding his human sanctity. By honouring the human nature of the murderer, everyone is reminded of the sanctity of humanity, and order is restored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By defending the murderer, we right what the murderer has wronged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though liberal humanism sancti es humans, it does not deny the existence of God, and is, in fact, founded on monotheist beliefs. The liberal belief in the free and sacred nature of each individual is a direct legacy of the traditional Christian belief in free and eternal individual souls. Without recourse to eternal souls and a Creator God, it becomes embarrassingly di cult for liberals to explain what is so special about individual Sapiens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another important sect is socialist humanism. Socialists believe that ‘humanity’</p>
<p class="calibre1">is collective rather than individualistic. They hold as sacred not the inner voice of each  individual,  but  the  species  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  as  a  whole.  Whereas  liberal humanism  seeks  as  much  freedom  as  possible  for  individual  humans,  socialist humanism seeks equality between all humans. According to socialists, inequality is the  worst  blasphemy  against  the  sanctity  of  humanity,  because  it  privileges peripheral  qualities  of  humans  over  their  universal  essence.  For  example,  when the rich are privileged over the poor, it means that we value money more than the universal essence of all humans, which is the same for rich and poor alike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like liberal humanism, socialist humanism is built on monotheist foundations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  idea  that  all  humans  are  equal  is  a  revamped version  of  the  monotheist conviction  that  all  souls  are  equal  before  God.  The  only  humanist  sect  that  has actually  broken  loose  from  traditional  monotheism  is  evolutionary  humanism, whose  most  famous  representatives  are  the  Nazis.  What  distinguished  the  Nazis from  other  humanist  sects  was  a  di erent  de nition  of  ‘humanity’,  one  deeply in uenced  by  the  theory  of  evolution.  In  contrast  to  other  humanists,  the  Nazis believed  that  humankind  is  not  something  universal  and  eternal,  but  rather  a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate. Man can evolve into superman, or degenerate into a subhuman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The main ambition of the Nazis was to protect humankind from degeneration</p>
<p class="calibre1">and encourage its progressive evolution. This is why the Nazis said that the Aryan race,  the  most  advanced  form  of  humanity,  had  to  be  protected  and  fostered, while  degenerate  kinds  of  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  like  Jews,  Roma,  homosexuals  and  the mentally  ill  had  to  be  quarantined  and  even  exterminated.  The  Nazis  explained that  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  itself  appeared  when  one  ‘superior’  population  of  ancient humans evolved, whereas ‘inferior’ populations such as the Neanderthals became extinct. These di erent populations were at  rst no more than di erent races, but developed  independently  along  their  own  evolutionary  paths.  This  might  well happen  again.  According  to  the  Nazis,  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  had  already  divided  into several distinct races, each with its own unique qualities. One of these races, the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>Aryan race, had the  nest qualities – rationalism, beauty, integrity, diligence. The Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman. Other races, such as Jews and blacks, were today’s Neanderthals, possessing inferior qualities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  allowed  to  breed,  and  in  particular  to  intermarry  with  Aryans,  they  would adulterate all human populations and doom  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> to extinction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Biologists  have  since  debunked  Nazi  racial  theory.  In  particular,  genetic research conducted after 1945 has demonstrated that the di erences between the various  human  lineages  are  far  smaller  than  the  Nazis  postulated.  But  these conclusions  are  relatively  new.  Given  the  state  of  scienti c  knowledge  in  1933, Nazi beliefs were hardly outside the pale. The existence of di erent human races, the  superiority  of  the  white  race,  and  the  need  to  protect  and  cultivate  this superior race were widely held beliefs among most Western elites. Scholars in the most prestigious Western universities, using the orthodox scienti c methods of the day, published studies that allegedly proved that members of the white race were more  intelligent,  more  ethical  and  more  skilled  than  Africans  or  Indians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Politicians in Washington, London and Canberra took it for granted that it was their job to prevent the adulteration and degeneration of the white race, by, for example,  restricting  immigration  from  China  or  even  Italy  to  ‘Aryan’  countries such as the USA and Australia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  positions  did  not  change  simply  because  new  scienti c  research  was published.  Sociological  and  political  developments  were  far  more  powerful engines  of  change.  In  this  sense,  Hitler  dug  not  just  his  own  grave  but  that  of racism in general. When he launched World War Two, he compelled his enemies to make clear distinctions between ‘us’ and ‘them’. Afterwards, precisely because Nazi ideology was so racist, racism became discredited in the West. But the change took time. White supremacy remained a mainstream ideology in American politics at least until the 1960s. The White Australia policy which restricted immigration of non-white people to Australia remained in force until 1973. Aboriginal Australians did  not  receive  equal  political  rights  until  the  1960s,  and  most  were  prevented from voting in elections because they were deemed unfit to function as citizens. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Nazis did not loathe humanity. They fought liberal humanism, human rights and  Communism  precisely  because  they  admired  humanity  and  believed  in  the great  potential  of  the  human  species.  But  following  the  logic  of  Darwinian</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a><img src="index-203_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">evolution, they argued that natural selection must be allowed to weed out un t individuals and leave only the  ttest to survive and reproduce. By succouring the weak,  liberalism  and  Communism  not  only  allowed  un t  individuals  to  survive, they  actually  gave  them  the  opportunity  to  reproduce,  thereby  undermining natural selection. In such a world, the  ttest humans would inevitably drown in a sea  of  un t  degenerates.  Humankind  would  become  less  and  less  t  with  each passing generation – which could lead to its extinction. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A 1942 German biology textbook explains in the chapter ‘The Laws of Nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Mankind’  that  the  supreme  law  of  nature  is  that  all  beings  are  locked  in  a remorseless  struggle  for  survival.  After  describing  how  plants  struggle  for territory, how beetles struggle to  nd mates and so forth, the textbook concludes that:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle for existence is hard and unforgiving, but is the only way to maintain life. This struggle eliminates everything  that  is  un t  for  life,  and  selects  everything  that  is  able  to  survive  …  These  natural  laws  are incontrovertible; living creatures demonstrate them by their very survival. They are unforgiving. Those who resist</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>them wil  be wiped out. Biology not only tel s us about animals and plants, but also shows us the laws we must fol ow in our lives, and steels our wil s to live and  ght according to these laws. The meaning of life is struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woe to him who sins against these laws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then follows a quotation from  <i class="calibre4">Mein Kampf</i>: ‘The person who attempts to  ght the iron logic of nature thereby  ghts the principles he must thank for his life as a human being. To fight against nature is to bring about one’s own destruction. <a href="index_split_005.html#p359">’3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  dawn  of  the  third  millennium,  the  future  of  evolutionary  humanism  is unclear. For sixty years after the end of the war against Hitler it was taboo to link humanism  with  evolution  and  to  advocate  using  biological  methods  to  upgrade’</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>.  But  today  such  projects  are  back  in  vogue.  No  one  speaks  about exterminating  lower  races  or  inferior  people,  but  many  contemplate  using  our increasing knowledge of human biology to create superhumans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, a huge gulf is opening between the tenets of liberal humanism and the latest  ndings of the life sciences, a gulf we cannot ignore much longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  liberal  political  and  judicial  systems  are  founded  on  the  belief  that  every individual  has  a  sacred  inner  nature,  indivisible  and  immutable,  which  gives meaning  to  the  world,  and  which  is  the  source  of  all  ethical  and  political authority. This is a reincarnation of the traditional Christian belief in a free and eternal soul that resides within each individual. Yet over the last 200 years, the life sciences have thoroughly undermined this belief. Scientists studying the inner workings  of  the  human  organism  have  found  no  soul  there.  They  increasingly argue  that  human  behaviour  is  determined  by  hormones,  genes  and  synapses, rather  than  by  free  will  –  the  same  forces  that  determine  the  behaviour  of chimpanzees,  wolves,  and  ants.  Our  judicial  and  political  systems  largely  try  to sweep such inconvenient discoveries under the carpet. But in all frankness, how long  can  we  maintain  the  wall  separating  the  department  of  biology  from  the departments of law and political science? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a><b class="calibre3">13</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Secret of Success</p>
<p class="calibre1">COMMERCE,  EMPIRES  AND  UNIVERSAL  religions  eventually  brought  virtually every Sapiens on every continent into the global world we live in today. Not that this  process  of  expansion  and  uni cation  was  linear  or  without  interruptions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at the bigger picture, though, the transition from many small cultures to a few large cultures and finally to a single global society was probably an inevitable result of the dynamics of human history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But saying that a global society is inevitable is not the same as saying that the end result had to be the particular kind of global society we now have. We can certainly imagine other outcomes. Why is English so widespread today, and not Danish?  Why  are  there  about  2  billion  Christians  and  1.25  billion  Muslims,  but only 150,000 Zoroastrians and no Manichaeans? If we could go back in time to 10,000  years  ago  and  set  the  process  going  again,  time  after  time,  would  we always see the rise of monotheism and the decline of dualism? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We can’t do such an experiment, so we don’t really know. But an examination of two crucial characteristics of history can provide us with some clues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1. The Hindsight Fal acy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every point in history is a crossroads. A single travelled road leads from the past to the present, but myriad paths fork o  into the future. Some of those paths are wider,  smoother  and  better  marked, and  are  thus  more  likely  to  be  taken,  but sometimes history – or the people who make history – takes unexpected turns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century AD,  the  Roman  Empire  faced  a  wide horizon  of  religious  possibilities.  It  could  have  stuck  to  its  traditional  and variegated polytheism. But its emperor, Constantine, looking back on a fractious century  of  civil  war,  seems  to  have  thought  that  a  single  religion  with  a  clear doctrine could help unify his ethnically diverse realm. He could have chosen any of  a  number  of  contemporary  cults  to  be  his  national  faith  –  Manichaeism, Mithraism, the cults of Isis or Cybele, Zoroastrianism, Judaism and even Buddhism</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>were  all  available  options.  Why  did  he  opt  for  Jesus?  Was  there  something  in Christian theology that attracted him personally, or perhaps an aspect of the faith that  made  him  think  it  would  be  easier  to  use  for  his  purposes?  Did  he  have  a religious experience, or did some of his advisers suggest that the Christians were quickly  gaining  adherents  and  that  it  would  be  best  to  jump  on  that  wagon? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historians can speculate, but not provide any de nitive answer. They can describe <i class="calibre4">how</i>  Christianity  took  over  the  Roman  Empire,  but  they  cannot  explain  <i class="calibre4">why</i>  this particular possibility was realised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  is  the  di erence  between  describing  ‘how’  and  explaining  ‘why’?  To describe ‘how’ means to reconstruct the series of speci c events that led from one point to another. To explain ‘why means to  nd causal connections that account for the occurrence of this particular series of events to the exclusion of all others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  scholars  do  indeed  provide  deterministic  explanations  of  events  such  as the rise of Christianity. They attempt to reduce human history to the workings of biological,  ecological  or  economic  forces.  They  argue  that  there  was  something about the geography, genetics or economy of the Roman Mediterranean that made the  rise  of  a  monotheist  religion  inevitable.  Yet  most  historians  tend  to  be sceptical of such deterministic theories. This is one of the distinguishing marks of history  as  an  academic  discipline  –  the  better  you  know  a  particular  historical period,  the  <i class="calibre4">harder</i> it becomes to explain why things happened one way and not another. Those who have only a super cial knowledge of a certain period tend to focus only on the possibility that was eventually realised. They offer a just-so story to  explain  with  hindsight  why  that  outcome  was  inevitable.  Those more  deeply informed about the period are much more cognisant of the roads not taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, the people who knew the period best – those alive at the time – were the most clueless of all. For the average Roman in Constantine’s time, the future was a fog. It is an iron rule of history that what looks inevitable in hindsight was far from obvious at the time. Today is no di erent. Are we out of the global economic crisis, or is the worst still to come? Will China continue growing until it becomes the leading superpower? Will the United States lose its hegemony? Is the upsurge of  monotheistic  fundamentalism  the  wave  of  the  future  or  a  local  whirlpool  of little  long-term  signi cance?  Are  we  heading  towards  ecological  disaster  or technological  paradise?  There  are  good  arguments  to  be  made  for  all  of  these outcomes,  but  no  way  of  knowing  for  sure.  In  a  few  decades,  people  will  look back and think that the answers to all of these questions were obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is particularly important to stress that possibilities which seem very unlikely to  contemporaries  often  get  realised.  When  Constantine  assumed  the  throne  in 306,  Christianity  was  little  more  than  an  esoteric  Eastern  sect.  If  you  were  to suggest  then  that  it  was  about  to  become  the  Roman  state  religion,  you’d  have been laughed out of the room just as you would be today if you were to suggest</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>that  by  the  year  2050  Hare  Krishna  would  be  the  state  religion  of  the  USA.  In October 1913, the Bolsheviks were a small radical Russian faction. No reasonable person would have predicted that within a mere four years they would take over the country. In AD 600, the notion that a band of desert-dwelling Arabs would soon conquer an expanse stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to India was even more preposterous.  Indeed,  had  the  Byzantine  army  been  able  to  repel  the  initial onslaught, Islam would probably have remained an obscure cult of which only a handful  of  cognoscenti  were  aware.  Scholars  would  then  have  a  very  easy  job explaining why a faith based on a revelation to a middle-aged Meccan merchant could never have caught on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  that  everything  is  possible.  Geographical,  biological  and  economic  forces create  constraints.  Yet  these  constraints  leave  ample  room  for  surprising developments, which do not seem bound by any deterministic laws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  conclusion  disappoints  many  people,  who  prefer  history  to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">deterministic. Determinism is appealing because it implies that our world and our beliefs are a natural and inevitable product of history. It is natural and inevitable that  we  live  in  nation  states,  organise  our  economy  along  capitalist  principles, and  fervently  believe  in  human  rights.  To  acknowledge  that  history  is  not deterministic is to acknowledge that it is just a coincidence that most people today believe in nationalism, capitalism and human rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">History  cannot  be  explained  deterministically  and  it  cannot  be  predicted because  it  is  chaotic.  So  many  forces  are  at  work  and  their  interactions  are  so complex that extremely small variations in the strength of the forces and the way they interact produce huge di erences in outcomes. Not only that, but history is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system. Chaotic systems come in two shapes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for  example,  is  a  level  one  chaotic  system.  Though  it  is  in uenced  by  myriad factors,  we  can  build  computer  models  that  take  more  and  more  of  them  into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never  be  predicted  accurately.  Markets,  for  example,  are  a  level  two  chaotic system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise. If the current price  of  oil  is  $90  a  barrel,  and  the  infallible  computer  program  predicts  that tomorrow it will be $100, traders will rush to buy oil so that they can pro t from the predicted price rise. As a result, the price will shoot up to $100 a barrel today rather than tomorrow. Then what will happen tomorrow? Nobody knows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Politics,  too,  is  a  second-order  chaotic  system.  Many  people  criticise Sovietologists for failing to predict the 1989 revolutions and castigate Middle East</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>experts  for  not  anticipating  the  Arab  Spring  revolutions  of  2011.  This  is  unfair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolutions  are,  by  de nition,  unpredictable.  A  predictable  revolution  never erupts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why not? Imagine that it’s 2010 and some genius political scientists in cahoots with a computer wizard have developed an infallible algorithm that, incorporated into an attractive interface, can be marketed as a revolution predictor. They o er their services to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and, in return for a generous down payment, tell Mubarak that according to their forecasts a revolution would certainly break out in Egypt during the course of the following year. How would Mubarak react? Most likely, he would immediately lower taxes, distribute billions of dollars in handouts to the citizenry – and also beef up his secret police force, just  in  case.  The  pre-emptive  measures  work.  The  year  comes  and  goes  and, surprise,  there  is  no  revolution.  Mubarak  demands  his  money  back.  ‘Your algorithm is worthless!’ he shouts at the scientists. ‘In the end I could have built another  palace  instead  of  giving  all  that  money  away!’  ‘But  the  reason  the revolution  didn’t  happen  is  because  we  predicted  it,’  the  scientists  say  in  their defence. ‘Prophets who predict things that don’t happen?’ Mubarak remarks as he motions his guards to grab them. ‘I could have picked up a dozen of those for next to nothing in the Cairo marketplace.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">So why study history? Unlike physics or economics, history is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our  horizons,  to  understand  that  our  present  situation  is  neither  natural  nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we  imagine.  For  example,  studying  how  Europeans  came  to  dominate  Africans enables  us  to  realise  that  there  is  nothing  natural  or  inevitable  about  the  racial hierarchy, and that the world might well be arranged differently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Blind Clio</p>
<p class="calibre1">We cannot explain the choices that history makes, but we can say something very important about them: history’s choices are not made for the bene t of humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is absolutely no proof that human well-being inevitably improves as history rolls  along.  There  is  no  proof  that  cultures  that  are  bene cial  to  humans  must inexorably succeed and spread, while less bene cial cultures disappear. There is no proof that Christianity was a better choice than Manichaeism, or that the Arab Empire was more beneficial than that of the Sassanid Persians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no proof that history is working for the bene t of humans because we lack an objective scale on which to measure such bene t. Di erent cultures de ne</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>the  good  di erently,  and  we  have  no  objective  yardstick  by  which  to  judge between  them.  The  victors,  of  course,  always  believe  that  their  de nition  is correct. But why should we believe the victors? Christians believe that the victory of Christianity over Manichaeism was bene cial to humankind, but if we do not accept  the  Christian  world  view  then  there  is  no  reason  to  agree  with  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muslims  believe  that  the  fall  of  the  Sassanid  Empire  into  Muslim  hands  was bene cial  to  humankind.  But  these  bene ts  are  evident  only  if  we  accept  the Muslim world view. It may well be that we’d all be better o  if Christianity and Islam had been forgotten or defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans  as  its  unwitting  host.  Organic  parasites,  such  as  viruses,  live  inside  the body of their hosts. They multiply and spread from one host to the other, feeding o  their hosts, weakening them, and sometimes even killing them. As long as the hosts live long enough to pass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition of its host. In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts and  sometimes  even  killing  them.  A  cultural  idea  –  such  as  belief  in  Christian heaven  above  the  clouds  or  Communist  paradise  here  on  earth  –  can  compel  a human to dedicate his or her life to spreading that idea, even at the price of death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The human dies, but the idea spreads. According to this approach, cultures are not conspiracies concocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as Marxists  tend  to  think).  Rather,  cultures  are  mental  parasites  that  emerge accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected by them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  approach  is  sometimes  called  memetics.  It  assumes  that,  just  as  organic evolution is based on the replication of organic information units called ‘genes’, so cultural evolution is based on the replication of cultural information units called</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘memes’. <a href="index_split_005.html#p359">1  </a>Successful  cultures  are  those  that  excel  in  reproducing  their  memes, irrespective of the costs and benefits to their human hosts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  scholars  in  the  humanities  disdain  memetics,  seeing  it  as an  amateurish attempt to explain cultural processes with crude biological analogies. But many of these  same  scholars  adhere  to  memetics’  twin  sister  –  postmodernism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Postmodernist thinkers speak about discourses rather than memes as the building blocks of culture. Yet they too see cultures as propagating themselves with little regard for the bene t of humankind. For example, postmodernist thinkers describe nationalism as a deadly plague that spread throughout the world in the nineteenth and  twentieth  centuries,  causing  wars,  oppression,  hate  and  genocide.  The moment  people  in  one  country  were  infected  with  it,  those  in  neighbouring countries were also likely to catch the virus. The nationalist virus presented itself as being beneficial for humans, yet it has been beneficial mainly to itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similar arguments are common in the social sciences, under the aegis of game</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>theory. Game theory explains how in multi-player systems, views and behaviour patterns that harm  <i class="calibre4">al </i> players nevertheless manage to take root and spread. Arms races are a famous example. Many arms races bankrupt all those who take part in them, without really changing the military balance of power. When Pakistan buys advanced  aeroplanes,  India  responds  in  kind.  When  India  develops  nuclear bombs, Pakistan follows suit. When Pakistan enlarges its navy, India counters. At the  end  of  the  process,  the  balance  of  power  may  remain  much  as  it  was,  but meanwhile billions of dollars that could have been invested in education or health are spent on weapons. Yet the arms race dynamic is hard to resist. ‘Arms racing’ is a pattern of behaviour that spreads itself like a virus from one country to another, harming everyone, but bene ting itself, under the evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction. (Keep in mind that an arms race, like a gene, has no awareness</p>
<p class="calibre1">–  it  does  not  consciously  seek  to  survive  and  reproduce.  Its  spread  is  the unintended result of a powerful dynamic.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">No  matter  what  you  call  it  –  game  theory,  postmodernism  or  memetics  –  the dynamics of history are not directed towards enhancing human well-being. There is no basis for thinking that the most successful cultures in history are necessarily the best ones for  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. Like evolution, history disregards the happiness of individual  organisms.  And  individual  humans,  for  their  part,  are  usually  far too ignorant and weak to influence the course of history to their own advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">History  proceeds  from  one  junction  to  the  next,  choosing  for  some  mysterious reason  to  follow  rst  this  path,  then  another.  Around AD  1500,  history  made  its most momentous choice, changing not only the fate of humankind, but arguably the  fate  of  all  life  on  earth.  We  call  it  the  Scienti c  Revolution.  It  began  in western Europe, a large peninsula on the western tip of Afro-Asia, which up till then played no important role in history. Why did the Scienti c Revolution begin there of all places, and not in China or India? Why did it begin at the midpoint of the second millennium AD rather than two centuries before or three centuries later? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We don’t know. Scholars have proposed dozens of theories, but none of them is particularly convincing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">History has a very wide horizon of possibilities, and many possibilities are never realised.  It  is  conceivable  to  imagine  history  going  on  for  generations  upon generations while bypassing the Scienti c Revolution, just as it is conceivable to imagine history without Christianity, without a Roman Empire, and without gold coins. </p>

Despite  many changes in technology, manners and political boundaries, this medieval Rip Van Winkle would have felt at home. But had one of Columbus’ sailors fallen into a similar slumber and woken up to the ringtone of a twenty- rst-century iPhone, he would  have  found  himself  in  a  world  strange  beyond  comprehension.  ‘Is  this heaven?’ he might well have asked himself. ‘Or perhaps – hell?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last 500 years have witnessed a phenomenal and unprecedented growth in</p>
<p class="calibre1">human power. In the year 1500, there were about 500 million  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> in the entire  world.  Today,  there  are  7  billion. <a href="index_split_005.html#p359">1  </a>The  total  value  of  goods  and  services produced by humankind in the year 1500 is estimated at $250 billion, in today’s dollars. <a href="index_split_005.html#p359">2  </a>Nowadays  the  value  of  a  year  of  human  production  is  close  to  $60</p>

<p class="calibre1">Suppose a single modern battleship got transported back to Columbus’ time. In a matter of seconds it could make driftwood out of the  <i class="calibre4">Niña</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Pinta</i> and  <i class="calibre4">Santa Maria</i> and  then  sink  the  navies  of  every  great  world  power  of  the  time  without sustaining  a  scratch.

<p class="calibre1">In  1500,  few  cities  had  more  than  100,000  inhabitants.  Most  buildings  were constructed  of  mud,  wood  and  straw;  a  three-storey  building  was  a  skyscraper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The streets were rutted dirt tracks, dusty in summer and muddy in winter, plied by pedestrians,  horses,  goats,  chickens  and  a  few  carts.  The  most  common  urban noises  were  human  and  animal  voices,  along  with  the  occasional  hammer  and saw. At sunset, the cityscape went black, with only an occasional candle or torch</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>ickering in the gloom. If an inhabitant of such a city could see modern Tokyo, New York or Mumbai, what would she think? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prior  to  the  sixteenth  century,  no  human  had  circumnavigated  the  earth.  This changed in 1522, when Magellan’s expedition returned to Spain after a journey of 72,000  kilometres.  It  took  three  years  and  cost  the  lives  of  almost  all  the  crew members,  Magellan  included.  In  1873,  Jules  Verne  could  imagine  that  Phileas Fogg, a wealthy British adventurer, might just be able to make it around the world in  eighty  days.  Today  anyone  with  a  middle-class  income  can  safely  and  easily circumnavigate the globe in just forty-eight hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1500, humans were con ned to the earth’s surface. They could build towers and climb mountains, but the sky was reserved for birds, angels and deities. On 20</p>
<p class="calibre1">July  1969  humans  landed  on  the  moon.  This  was  not  merely  a  historical achievement,  but  an  evolutionary  and  even  cosmic  feat.  During  the  previous  4</p>
<p class="calibre1">billion  years  of  evolution,  no  organism  managed  even  to  leave  the  earth’s atmosphere, and certainly none left a foot or tentacle print on the moon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  most  of  history,  humans  knew  nothing  about  99.99  per  cent  of  the organisms on the planet – namely, the microorganisms. This was not because they were of no concern to us. Each of us bears billions of one-celled creatures within us, and not just as free-riders. They are our best friends, and deadliest enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of them digest our food and clean our guts, while others cause illnesses and epidemics. Yet it was only in 1674 that a human eye  rst saw a microorganism, when  Anton  van  Leeuwenhoek  took  a  peek  through  his  home-made  microscope and was startled to see an entire world of tiny creatures milling about in a drop of water. During the subsequent 300 years, humans have made the acquaintance of a huge  number  of  microscopic  species.  We’ve  managed  to  defeat  most  of  the deadliest  contagious  diseases  they  cause,  and  have  harnessed  microorganisms  in the  service  of  medicine  and  industry.  Today  we  engineer  bacteria  to  produce medications, manufacture biofuel and kill parasites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  single  most  remarkable  and  de ning  moment  of  the  past  500  years came  at  05:29:45  on  16  July  1945.  At  that  precise  second,  American  scientists detonated  the  rst  atomic  bomb  at  Alamogordo,  New  Mexico.  From  that  point onward, humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history, but to end it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The historical process that led to Alamogordo and to the moon is known as the Scienti c  Revolution.  During  this  revolution  humankind  has  obtained  enormous new  powers  by  investing  resources  in  scienti c  research.  It  is  a  revolution because,  until  about AD  1500,  humans  the  world  over  doubted  their  ability  to obtain  new  medical,  military  and  economic  powers.  While  government  and wealthy  patrons  allocated  funds  to  education  and  scholarship,  the  aim  was,  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a><img src="index-214_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">general,  to  preserve  existing  capabilities  rather  than  acquire  new  ones.  The typical premodern ruler gave money to priests, philosophers and poets in the hope that  they  would  legitimise  his  rule  and  maintain  the  social  order.  He  did  not expect  them  to  discover  new  medications,  invent  new  weapons  or  stimulate economic growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  last  ve  centuries,  humans  increasingly  came  to  believe  that  they could increase their capabilities by investing in scienti c research. This wasn’t just blind faith – it was repeatedly proven empirically. The more proofs there were, the  more  resources  wealthy  people  and  governments  were  willing  to  put  into science.  We  would  never  have  been  able  to  walk  on  the  moon,  engineer microorganisms and split the atom without such investments. The US government, for  example,  has  in  recent  decades  allocated  billions  of  dollars  to  the  study  of nuclear physics. The knowledge produced by this research has made possible the construction  of  nuclear  power  stations,  which  provide  cheap  electricity  for American industries, which pay taxes to the US government, which uses some of these taxes to finance further research in nuclear physics. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Scientific Revolution’s feedback loop. Science needs more than just research to make progress. It</b> <b class="calibre3">depends on the mutual reinforcement of science, politics and economics. Political and economic</b> <b class="calibre3">institutions provide the resources without which scientific research is almost impossible. In return,</b> <b class="calibre3">scientific research provides new powers that are used, among other things, to obtain new resources,</b> <b class="calibre3">some of which are reinvested in research</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why did modern humans develop a growing belief in their ability to obtain new powers  through  research?  What  forged  the  bond  between  science,  politics  and economics? This chapter looks at the unique nature of modern science in order to provide part of the answer. The next two chapters examine the formation of the alliance between science, the European empires and the economics of capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>Ignoramus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans  have  sought  to  understand  the  universe  at  least  since  the  Cognitive Revolution.  Our  ancestors  put  a  great  deal  of  time  and  e ort  into  trying  to discover the rules that govern the natural world. But modern science di ers from all previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">a. The willingness to admit ignorance</b>. Modern science is based on the Latin injunction  <i class="calibre4">ignoramus</i>  –  ‘we  do  not  know’.  It  assumes  that  we  don’t  know everything.  Even  more  critically,  it  accepts that  the  things  that  we  think  we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory is sacred and beyond challenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">b.  The  centrality  of  observation  and  mathematics</b>.  Having  admitted ignorance,  modern  science  aims  to  obtain  new  knowledge.  It  does  so  by gathering  observations  and  then  using  mathematical  tools  to  connect  these observations into comprehensive theories. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">c. The acquisition of new powers</b>. Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Scienti c  Revolution  has  not  been  a  revolution  of  knowledge.  It  has  been above  all  a  revolution  of  ignorance.  The  great  discovery  that  launched  the Scienti c Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Premodern  traditions  of  knowledge  such  as  Islam,  Christianity,  Buddhism  and Confucianism asserted that everything that is important to know about the world was already known. The great gods, or the one almighty God, or the wise people of  the  past  possessed  all-encompassing  wisdom,  which  they  revealed  to  us  in scriptures and oral traditions. Ordinary mortals gained knowledge by delving into these  ancient  texts  and  traditions  and  understanding  them  properly.  It  was inconceivable that the Bible, the Qur’an or the Vedas were missing out on a crucial secret of the universe – a secret that might yet be discovered by  esh-and-blood creatures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ancient traditions of knowledge admitted only two kinds of ignorance. First, an <i class="calibre4">individual</i>  might  be  ignorant  of  something  important.  To  obtain  the  necessary knowledge, all he needed to do was ask somebody wiser. There was no need to discover  something  that  nobody  yet  knew.  For  example,  if  a  peasant  in  some thirteenth-century  Yorkshire  village  wanted  to  know  how  the  human  race originated, he assumed that Christian tradition held the de nitive answer. All he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>had to do was ask the local priest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, an  <i class="calibre4">entire tradition</i> might be ignorant of  <i class="calibre4">unimportant</i> things. By de nition, whatever the great gods or the wise people of the past did not bother to tell us was  unimportant.  For  example,  if  our  Yorkshire  peasant  wanted  to  know  how spiders weave their webs, it was pointless to ask the priest, because there was no answer  to  this  question  in  any  of  the  Christian  Scriptures.  That  did  not  mean, however, that Christianity was de cient. Rather, it meant that understanding how spiders  weave  their  webs  was  unimportant.  After  all,  God  knew  perfectly  well how spiders do it. If this were a vital piece of information, necessary for human prosperity and salvation, God would have included a comprehensive explanation in the Bible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christianity did not forbid people to study spiders. But spider scholars – if there were any in medieval Europe – had to accept their peripheral role in society and the  irrelevance  of  their  ndings  to  the  eternal  truths  of  Christianity.  No  matter what a scholar might discover about spiders or butter ies or Galapagos  nches, that knowledge was little more than trivia, with no bearing on the fundamental truths of society, politics and economics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, things were never quite that simple. In every age, even the most pious and conservative, there were people who argued that there were  <i class="calibre4">important</i> things of  which  their  <i class="calibre4">entire  tradition</i>  was  ignorant.  Yet  such  people  were  usually marginalised  or  persecuted  –  or  else  they  founded  a  new  tradition  and  began arguing  that  <i class="calibre4">they</i>  knew  everything  there  is  to  know.  For  example,  the  prophet Muhammad began his religious career by condemning his fellow Arabs for living in  ignorance  of  the  divine  truth.  Yet  Muhammad  himself  very  quickly  began  to argue that  <i class="calibre4">he</i> knew the full truth, and his followers began calling him ‘The Seal of the Prophets’. Henceforth, there was no need of revelations beyond those given to Muhammad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern-day science is a unique tradition of knowledge, inasmuch as it openly admits  <i class="calibre4">col ective</i>  ignorance  regarding  <i class="calibre4">the  most  important  questions</i>.  Darwin  never argued that he was ‘The Seal of the Biologists’, and that he had solved the riddle of life  once  and  for  all.  After  centuries  of  extensive  scienti c  research,  biologists admit  that  they  still  don’t  have  any  good  explanation  for  how  brains  produce consciousness. Physicists admit that they don’t know what caused the Big Bang, or how to reconcile quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  other  cases,  competing  scienti c  theories  are  vociferously  debated  on  the basis of constantly emerging new evidence. A prime example is the debates about how best to run the economy. Though individual economists may claim that their method  is  the  best,  orthodoxy  changes  with  every  nancial  crisis  and  stock-exchange bubble, and it is generally accepted that the  nal word on economics is yet to be said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>In  still  other  cases,  particular  theories  are  supported  so  consistently  by  the available  evidence,  that  all  alternatives  have  long  since  fallen  by  the  wayside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such theories are accepted as true – yet everyone agrees that were new evidence to  emerge  that  contradicts  the  theory,  it  would  have  to  be  revised  or  discarded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good examples of these are the plate tectonics theory and the theory of evolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  willingness  to  admit  ignorance  has  made  modern  science  more  dynamic, supple and inquisitive than any previous tradition of knowledge. This has hugely expanded  our  capacity  to  understand  how  the  world  works  and  our  ability  to invent new technologies. But it presents us with a serious problem that most of our ancestors did not have to cope with. Our current assumption that we do not know everything, and that even the knowledge we possess is tentative, extends to the shared myths that enable millions of strangers to cooperate e ectively. If the evidence shows that many of those myths are doubtful, how can we hold society together? How can our communities, countries and international system function? </p>
<p class="calibre1">All modern attempts to stabilise the sociopolitical order have had no choice but to rely on either of two unscientific methods:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">a</b>.  Take  a  scienti c  theory,  and  in  opposition  to  common  scienti c  practices, <i class="calibre4">declare  that  it  is  a  nal  and  absolute  truth</i>.  This  was  the  method  used  by  Nazis (who claimed that their racial policies were the corollaries of biological facts) and  Communists  (who  claimed  that  Marx  and  Lenin  had  divined  absolute economic truths that could never be refuted). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">b</b>. Leave science out of it and live in accordance with  <i class="calibre4">a non-scienti c absolute truth</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  has  been  the  strategy  of  liberal  humanism,  which  is  built  on  a  dogmatic belief in the unique worth and rights of human beings – a doctrine which has embarrassingly little in common with the scientific study of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  that  shouldn’t  surprise  us.  Even  science  itself  has  to  rely  on  religious  and ideological beliefs to justify and finance its research. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern culture has nevertheless been willing to embrace ignorance to a much greater degree than has any previous culture. One of the things that has made it possible  for  modern  social  orders  to  hold  together  is  the  spread  of  an  almost religious belief in technology and in the methods of scienti c research, which have replaced to some extent the belief in absolute truths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Scientific Dogma</p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern  science  has  no  dogma.  Yet  it  has  a  common  core  of  research  methods, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>which are all based on collecting empirical observations – those we can observe with  at  least  one  of  our  senses  –  and  putting  them  together  with  the  help  of mathematical tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People throughout history collected empirical observations, but the importance of these observations was usually limited. Why waste precious resources obtaining new observations when we already have all the answers we need? But as modern people came to admit that they did not know the answers to some very important questions,  they  found  it  necessary  to  look  for  <i class="calibre4">completely  new</i>  knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently,  the  dominant  modern  research  method  takes  for  granted  the insu ciency of old knowledge. Instead of studying old traditions, emphasis is now placed on new observations and experiments. When present observation collides with past tradition, we give precedence to the observation. Of course, physicists analysing the spectra of distant galaxies, archaeologists analysing the  nds from a Bronze Age city, and political scientists studying the emergence of capitalism do not disregard tradition. They start by studying what the wise people of the past have  said  and  written.  But  from  their  rst  year  in  college,  aspiring  physicists, archaeologists  and  political  scientists  are  taught  that  it  is  their  mission  to  go beyond what Einstein, Heinrich Schliemann and Max Weber ever knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mere  observations,  however,  are  not  knowledge.  In  order  to  understand  the universe,  we  need  to  connect  observations  into  comprehensive  theories.  Earlier traditions  usually  formulated  their  theories  in  terms  of  stories.  Modern  science uses mathematics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are very few equations, graphs and calculations in the Bible, the Qur’an, the Vedas or the Confucian classics. When traditional mythologies and scriptures laid  down  general  laws,  these  were  presented  in  narrative  rather  than mathematical form. Thus a fundamental principle of Manichaean religion asserted that  the  world  is  a  battleground  between  good  and  evil.  An  evil  force  created matter, while a good force created spirit. Humans are caught between these two forces, and should choose good over evil. Yet the prophet Mani made no attempt to o er a mathematical formula that could be used to predict human choices by quantifying the respective strength of these two forces. He never calculated that</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the force acting on a man is equal to the acceleration of his spirit divided by the mass of his body’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  exactly  what  scientists  seek  to  accomplish.  In  1687,  Isaac  Newton published  <i class="calibre4">The  Mathematical  Principles  of  Natural  Philosophy</i>,  arguably  the  most important  book  in  modern  history.  Newton  presented  a  general  theory  of movement and change. The greatness of Newton’s theory was its ability to explain and  predict  the  movements  of  all  bodies  in  the  universe,  from  falling  apples  to shooting stars, using three very simple mathematical laws:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a><img src="index-219_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Henceforth, anyone who wished to understand and predict the movement of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannonball  or  a  planet  simply  had  to  make  measurements  of  the  object’s  mass, direction and acceleration, and the forces acting on it. By inserting these numbers into  Newton’s  equations,  the  future  position  of  the  object  could  be  predicted.  It worked like magic. Only around the end of the nineteenth century did scientists come across a few observations that did not  t well with Newton’s laws, and these led  to  the  next  revolutions  in  physics  –  the  theory  of  relativity  and  quantum mechanics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newton showed that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some chapters (for example) boil down to a clear-cut equation; but scholars who attempted  to  reduce  biology,  economics  and  psychology  to  neat  Newtonian equations have discovered that these  elds have a level of complexity that makes such  an  aspiration  futile.  This  did  not  mean,  however,  that  they  gave  up  on mathematics. A new branch of mathematics was developed over the last 200 years to deal with the more complex aspects of reality: statistics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1744,  two  Presbyterian  clergymen  in  Scotland,  Alexander  Webster  and Robert  Wallace,  decided  to  set  up  a  life-insurance  fund  that  would  provide pensions for the widows and orphans of dead clergymen. They proposed that each of their church’s ministers would pay a small portion of his income into the fund, which  would  invest  the  money.  If  a  minister  died,  his  widow  would  receive dividends on the fund’s pro ts. This would allow her to live comfortably for the rest of her life. But to determine how much the ministers had to pay in so that the fund would have enough money to live up to its obligations, Webster and Wallace had  to  be  able  to  predict  how  many  ministers  would  die  each  year,  how  many widows  and  orphans  they  would  leave  behind,  and  by  how  many  years  the widows would outlive their husbands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take note of what the two churchmen did not do. They did not pray to God to reveal  the  answer.  Nor  did  they  search  for  an  answer  in  the  Holy  Scriptures  or among  the  works  of  ancient  theologians.  Nor  did  they  enter  into  an  abstract philosophical  disputation.  Being  Scots,  they  were  practical  types.  So  they contacted  a  professor  of  mathematics  from  the  University  of  Edinburgh,  Colin</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>Maclaurin. The three of them collected data on the ages at which people died and used these to calculate how many ministers were likely to pass away in any given year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  work  was  founded  on  several  recent  breakthroughs  in  the  elds  of statistics  and  probability.  One  of  these  was  Jacob  Bernoulli’s  Law  of  Large Numbers.  Bernoulli  had  codi ed  the  principle  that  while  it  might  be  di cult  to predict with certainty a single event, such as the death of a particular person, it was possible to predict with great accuracy the average outcome of many similar events. That is, while Maclaurin could not use maths to predict whether Webster and Wallace would die next year, he could, given enough data, tell Webster and Wallace how many Presbyterian ministers in Scotland would almost certainly die next  year.  Fortunately,  they  had  ready-made  data  that  they  could  use.  Actuary tables  published  fty  years  previously  by  Edmond  Halley  proved  particularly useful.  Halley  had  analysed  records  of  1,238  births  and  1,174  deaths  that  he obtained from the city of Breslau, Germany. Halley’s tables made it possible to see that,  for  example,  a  twenty-year-old  person  has  a  1:100  chance  of  dying  in  a given year, but a fifty-year-old person has a 1:39 chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Processing  these  numbers,  Webster  and  Wallace  concluded  that,  on  average, there would be 930 living Scottish Presbyterian ministers at any given moment, and an average of twenty-seven ministers would die each year, eighteen of whom would  be  survived  by  widows.  Five  of  those  who  did  not  leave  widows  would leave  orphaned  children,  and  two  of  those  survived  by  widows  would  also  be outlived by children from previous marriages who had not yet reached the age of sixteen.  They  further  computed  how  much  time  was  likely  to  go  by  before  the widows’ death or remarriage (in both these eventualities, payment of the pension would cease). These  gures enabled Webster and Wallace to determine how much money the ministers who joined their fund had to pay in order to provide for their loved ones. By contributing £2 12 <i class="calibre4">s</i>. 2 <i class="calibre4">d</i>. a year, a minister could guarantee that his widowed wife would receive at least £10 a year – a hefty sum in those days. If he thought that was not enough he could choose to pay in more, up to a level of £6</p>
<p class="calibre1">11 <i class="calibre4">s</i>. 3 <i class="calibre4">d</i>. a year – which would guarantee his widow the even more handsome sum of £25 a year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to their calculations, by the year 1765 the Fund for a Provision for the Widows and Children of the Ministers of the Church of Scotland would have capital  totalling  £58,348.  Their  calculations  proved  amazingly  accurate.  When that  year  arrived,  the  fund’s  capital  stood  at  £58,347  –  just  £1  less  than  the prediction! This was even better than the prophecies of Habakkuk, Jeremiah or St John.  Today,  Webster  and  Wallace’s  fund,  known  simply  as Scottish  Widows,  is one  of  the  largest  pension  and  insurance  companies  in  the  world.  With  assets worth £100 billion, it insures not only Scottish widows, but anyone willing to buy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>its policies. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Probability calculations such as those used by the two Scottish ministers became the foundation not merely of actuarial science, which is central to the pension and insurance  business,  but  also  of  the  science  of  demography  (founded  by  another clergyman,  the  Anglican  Robert  Malthus).  Demography  in  its  turn  was  the cornerstone  on  which  Charles  Darwin  (who  almost  became  an  Anglican  pastor) built his theory of evolution. While there are no equations that predict what kind of  organism  will  evolve  under  a  speci c  set  of  conditions,  geneticists  use probability calculations to compute the likelihood that a particular mutation will spread in a given population. Similar probabilistic models have become central to economics,  sociology,  psychology,  political  science  and  the  other  social  and natural  sciences.  Even  physics  eventually  supplemented  Newton’s  classical equations with the probability clouds of quantum mechanics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We need merely look at the history of education to realise how far this process has taken us. Throughout most of history, mathematics was an esoteric  eld that even educated people rarely studied seriously. In medieval Europe, logic, grammar and rhetoric  formed  the  educational  core,  while  the  teaching  of  mathematics  seldom went  beyond  simple  arithmetic  and  geometry.  Nobody  studied  statistics.  The undisputed monarch of all sciences was theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today few students study rhetoric; logic is restricted to philosophy departments, and theology to seminaries. But more and more students are motivated – or forced</p>
<p class="calibre1">– to study mathematics. There is an irresistible drift towards the exact sciences –</p>
<p class="calibre1">defined as ‘exact’ by their use of mathematical tools. Even fields of study that were traditionally  part  of  the  humanities,  such  as  the  study  of  human  language (linguistics)  and  the  human  psyche  (psychology),  rely  increasingly  on mathematics  and  seek  to  present  themselves  as  exact  sciences.  Statistics  courses are now part of the basic requirements not just in physics and biology, but also in psychology, sociology, economics and political science. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the course catalogue of the psychology department at my own university, the rst  required  course  in  the  curriculum  is  ‘Introduction  to  Statistics  and Methodology  in  Psychological  Research’.  Second-year  psychology  students  must take ‘Statistical Methods in Psychological Research’. Confucius, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad  would  have  been  bewildered  if  you  told  them  that  in  order  to understand the human mind and cure its illnesses you must first study statistics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowledge is Power</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>Most people have a hard time digesting modern science because its mathematical language  is  di cult  for  our  minds  to  grasp,  and  its  ndings  often  contradict common  sense.  Out  of  the  7  billion  people  in  the  world,  how  many  really understand  quantum  mechanics,  cell  biology  or  macroeconomics?  Science nevertheless  enjoys  immense  prestige  because  of  the  new  powers  it  gives  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presidents and generals may not understand nuclear physics, but they have a good grasp of what nuclear bombs can do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1620 Francis Bacon published a scientific manifesto tided  <i class="calibre4">The New Instrument</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  it  he  argued  that  ‘knowledge  is  power’.  The  real  test  of  ‘knowledge’  is  not whether it is true, but whether it empowers us. Scientists usually assume that no theory is 100 per cent correct. Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  real  test  is  utility.  A  theory  that  enables  us  to  do  new  things  constitutes knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  the  centuries,  science  has  o ered  us  many  new  tools.  Some  are  mental tools, such as those used to predict death rates and economic growth. Even more important  are  technological  tools.  The  connection  forged  between  science  and technology is so strong that today people tend to confuse the two. We often think that it is impossible to develop new technologies without scienti c research, and that there is little point in research if it does not result in new technologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  the  relationship  between  science  and  technology  is  a  very  recent phenomenon. Prior to 1500, science and technology were totally separate  elds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Bacon  connected  the  two  in  the  early  seventeenth  century,  it  was  a revolutionary  idea.  During  the seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries  this relationship tightened, but the knot was tied only in the nineteenth century. Even in 1800, most rulers who wanted a strong army, and most business magnates who wanted a successful business, did not bother to finance research in physics, biology or economics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t mean to claim that there is no exception to this rule. A good historian can  nd precedent for everything. But an even better historian knows when these precedents are but curiosities that cloud the big picture. Generally speaking, most premodern rulers and business people did not  nance research about the nature of the universe in order to develop new technologies, and most thinkers did not try to translate their  ndings into technological gadgets. Rulers  nanced educational institutions whose mandate was to spread traditional knowledge for the purpose of buttressing the existing order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here  and  there  people  did  develop  new  technologies,  but  these  were  usually created by uneducated craftsmen using trial and error, not by scholars pursuing systematic  scienti c  research.  Cart  manufacturers  built  the  same  carts  from  the same  materials  year  in  year  out.  They  did  not  set  aside  a  percentage  of  their annual  pro ts  in  order  to  research  and  develop  new  cart  models.  Cart  design</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a><img src="index-223_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">occasionally  improved,  but  it  was  usually  thanks  to  the  ingenuity  of  some  local carpenter who never set foot in a university and did not even know how to read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was true of the public as well as the private sector. Whereas modern states call in their scientists to provide solutions in almost every area of national policy, from  energy  to  health  to  waste  disposal,  ancient  kingdoms  seldom  did  so.  The contrast between then and now is most pronounced in weaponry. When outgoing President  Dwight  Eisenhower  warned  in  1961  of  the  growing  power  of  the military-industrial  complex,  he  left  out  a  part  of  the  equation.  He  should  have alerted  his  country  to  the  military-industrial-scienti c  complex,  because  today’s wars are scienti c productions. The world’s military forces initiate, fund and steer a large part of humanity’s scientific research and technological development. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  World  War  One  bogged  down  into  interminable  trench  warfare,  both sides called in the scientists to break the deadlock and save the nation. The men in white answered the call, and out of the laboratories rolled a constant stream of new  wonder-weapons:  combat  aircraft,  poison  gas,  tanks,  submarines  and  ever more efficient machine guns, artillery pieces, rifles and bombs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p368"><b class="calibre3">33. </b></a><b class="calibre3"> German V-2 rocket ready to launch. It didn’t defeat the Allies, but it kept the Germans hoping for a</b> <b class="calibre3">technological miracle until the very last days of the war</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Science played an even larger role in World War Two. By late 1944 Germany</p>
<p class="calibre1">was losing the war and defeat was imminent. A year earlier, the Germans’ allies, the  Italians,  had  toppled  Mussolini  and  surrendered  to  the  Allies.  But  Germany kept  ghting  on,  even  though  the  British,  American  and  Soviet  armies  were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>closing in. One reason German soldiers and civilians thought not all was lost was that  they  believed  German  scientists  were  about  to  turn  the  tide  with  so-called miracle weapons such as the V-2 rocket and jet-powered aircraft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the Germans were working on rockets and jets, the American Manhattan</p>
<p class="calibre1">Project successfully developed atomic bombs. By the time the bomb was ready, in early August 1945, Germany had already surrendered, but Japan was  ghting on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">American forces were poised to invade its home islands. The Japanese vowed to resist the invasion and  ght to the death, and there was every reason to believe that it was no idle threat. American generals told President Harry S. Truman that an  invasion  of  Japan  would  cost  the  lives  of  a  million  American  soldiers  and would extend the war well into 1946. Truman decided to use the new bomb. Two weeks and two atom bombs later, Japan surrendered unconditionally and the war was over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  science  is  not  just  about  o ensive  weapons.  It  plays  a  major  role  in  our defences as well. Today many Americans believe that the solution to terrorism is technological rather than political. Just give millions more to the nanotechnology industry, they believe, and the United States could send bionic spy- ies into every Afghan cave, Yemenite redoubt and North African encampment. Once that’s done, Osama Bin Laden’s heirs will not be able to make a cup of co ee without a CIA spy- y  passing  this  vital  information  back  to  headquarters  in  Langley.  Allocate millions more to brain research, and every airport could be equipped with ultra-sophisticated FMRI scanners that could immediately recognise angry and hateful thoughts in people’s brains. Will it really work? Who knows. Is it wise to develop bionic  ies and thought-reading scanners? Not necessarily. Be that as it may, as you  read  these  lines,  the  US  Department  of  Defense  is  transferring  millions  of dollars to nanotechnology and brain laboratories for work on these and other such ideas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This obsession with military technology – from tanks to atom bombs to spy- ies</p>
<p class="calibre1">– is a surprisingly recent phenomenon. Up until the nineteenth century, the vast majority  of  military  revolutions  were  the  product  of  organisational  rather  than technological  changes.  When  alien  civilisations  met  for  the  rst  time, technological gaps sometimes played an important role. But even in such cases, few thought of deliberately creating or enlarging such gaps. Most empires did not rise thanks to technological wizardry, and their rulers did not give much thought to  technological  improvement.  The  Arabs  did  not  defeat  the  Sassanid  Empire thanks  to  superior  bows  or  swords,  the  Seljuks  had  no  technological  advantage over the Byzantines, and the Mongols did not conquer China with the help of some ingenious new weapon. In fact, in all these cases the vanquished enjoyed superior military and civilian technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Roman army is a particularly good example. It was the best army of its day, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>yet technologically speaking, Rome had no edge over Carthage, Macedonia or the Seleucid Empire. Its advantage rested on efficient organisation, iron discipline and huge  manpower  reserves.  The  Roman  army  never  set  up  a  research  and development  department,  and  its  weapons  remained  more  or  less  the  same  for centuries  on  end.  If  the  legions  of  Scipio  Aemilianus  –  the  general  who  levelled Carthage  and  defeated  the  Numantians  in  the  second  century BC  –  had  suddenly popped up 500 years later in the age of Constantine the Great, Scipio would have had a fair chance of beating Constantine. Now imagine what would happen to a general from a few centuries back – say Napoleon – if he led his troops against a modern armoured brigade. Napoleon was a brilliant tactician, and his men were crack  professionals,  but  their  skills  would  be  useless  in  the  face  of  modern weaponry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As in Rome, so also in ancient China: most generals and philosophers did not think  it  their  duty  to  develop  new  weapons.  The  most  important  military invention  in  the  history  of  China  was  gunpowder.  Yet  to  the  best  of  our knowledge, gunpowder was invented accidentally, by Daoist alchemists searching for  the  elixir  of  life.  Gunpowder’s  subsequent  career  is  even  more  telling.  One might have thought that the Daoist alchemists would have made China master of the  world.  In  fact,  the  Chinese  used  the  new  compound  mainly  for  recrackers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even as the Song Empire collapsed in the face of a Mongol invasion, no emperor set up a medieval Manhattan Project to save the empire by inventing a doomsday weapon.  Only  in  the  fteenth  century  –  about  600  years  after  the  invention  of gunpowder – did cannons become a decisive factor on Afro-Asian battlefields. Why did it take so long for the deadly potential of this substance to be put to military use? Because it appeared at a time when neither kings, scholars, nor merchants thought that new military technology could save them or make them rich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  situation  began  to  change  in  the  fteenth  and  sixteenth  centuries,  but another 200 years went by before most rulers evinced any interest in  nancing the research and development of new weapons. Logistics and strategy continued to  have  far  greater  impact  on  the  outcome  of  wars  than  technology.  The Napoleonic military machine that crushed the armies of the European powers at Austerlitz  (1805) was armed with more or less the same weaponry that the army of Louis XVI had used. Napoleon himself, despite being an artilleryman, had little interest in new weapons, even though scientists and inventors tried to persuade him to fund the development of flying machines, submarines and rockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Science, industry and military technology intertwined only with the advent of the  capitalist  system  and  the  Industrial  Revolution.  Once  this  relationship  was established, however, it quickly transformed the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>The Ideal of Progress</p>
<p class="calibre1">Until  the  Scienti c  Revolution  most  human  cultures  did  not  believe  in  progress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They thought the golden age was in the past, and that the world was stagnant, if not deteriorating. Strict adherence to the wisdom of the ages might perhaps bring back the good old times, and human ingenuity might conceivably improve this or that facet of daily life. However, it was considered impossible for human know-how to overcome the world’s fundamental problems. If even Muhammad, Jesus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buddha and Confucius – who knew everything there is to know – were unable to abolish famine, disease, poverty and war from the world, how could we expect to do so? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many faiths believed that some day a messiah would appear and end all wars, famines  and  even  death  itself.  But  the  notion  that  humankind  could  do  so  by discovering new knowledge and inventing new tools was worse than ludicrous – it was hubris. The story of the Tower of Babel, the story of Icarus, the story of the Golem  and  countless  other  myths  taught  people  that  any  attempt  to  go  beyond human limitations would inevitably lead to disappointment and disaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When modern culture admitted that there were many important things that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">still did not know, and when that admission of ignorance was married to the idea that scienti c discoveries could give us new powers, people began suspecting that real progress might be possible after all. As science began to solve one unsolvable problem after another, many became convinced that humankind could overcome</p>
<p class="calibre1">any  and  every  problem  by  acquiring  and  applying  new  knowledge.  Poverty, sickness, wars, famines, old age and death itself were not the inevitable fate of humankind. They were simply the fruits of our ignorance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a><img src="index-227_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p368"><b class="calibre3">34. </b></a><b class="calibre3"> Benjamin Franklin disarming the gods</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A famous example is lightning. Many cultures believed that lightning was the hammer of an angry god, used to punish sinners. In the middle of the eighteenth century, in one of the most celebrated experiments in scienti c history, Benjamin Franklin  ew a kite during a lightning storm to test the hypothesis that lightning is  simply  an  electric  current.  Franklins  empirical  observations,  coupled  with  his knowledge  about  the  qualities  of  electrical  energy,  enabled  him  to  invent  the lightning rod and disarm the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poverty  is  another  case  in  point.  Many  cultures  have  viewed  poverty  as  an inescapable part of this imperfect world. According to the New Testament, shortly before  the  cruci xion  a  woman  anointed  Christ  with  precious  oil  worth  300</p>
<p class="calibre1">denarii. Jesus’ disciples scolded the woman for wasting such a huge sum of money instead of giving it to the poor, but Jesus defended her, saying that ‘The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me’ (Mark 14:7). Today, fewer and fewer people, including fewer  and  fewer  Christians,  agree  with  Jesus on  this  matter.  Poverty  is increasingly seen as a technical problem amenable to intervention. It’s common wisdom  that  policies  based  on  the  latest  ndings  in  agronomy,  economics, medicine and sociology can eliminate poverty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And indeed, many parts of the world have already been freed from the worst</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms of deprivation. Throughout history, societies have su ered from two kinds of  poverty:  social  poverty,  which  withholds  from  some  people  the  opportunities available to others; and biological poverty, which puts the very lives of individuals at  risk  due  to  lack  of  food  and  shelter.  Perhaps  social  poverty  can  never  be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>eradicated, but in many countries around the world biological poverty is a thing of the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until  recently,  most  people  hovered  very  close  to  the  biological  poverty  line, below  which  a  person  lacks  enough  calories  to  sustain  life  for  long.  Even  small miscalculations  or  misfortunes  could  easily  push  people  below  that  line,  into starvation.  Natural  disasters  and  man-made  calamities  often  plunged  entire populations  over  the  abyss,  causing  the  death  of  millions.  Today  most  of  the world’s people have a safety net stretched below them. Individuals are protected from  personal  misfortune  by  insurance,  state-sponsored  social  security  and  a plethora of local and international NGOs. When calamity strikes an entire region, worldwide relief e orts are usually successful in preventing the worst. People still su er from numerous degradations, humiliations and poverty-related illnesses, but in  most  countries  nobody  is  starving  to  death.  In  fact,  in  many  societies  more people are in danger of dying from obesity than from starvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gilgamesh Project</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of all mankind’s ostensibly insoluble problems, one has remained the most vexing, interesting and important: the problem of death itself. Before the late modern era, most  religions  and  ideologies  took  it  for  granted  that  death  was  our  inevitable fate. Moreover, most faiths turned death into the main source of meaning in life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Try  to  imagine  Islam,  Christianity  or  the  ancient  Egyptian  religion  in  a  world without  death.  These  creeds  taught  people  that  they  must come  to  terms  with death and pin their hopes on the afterlife, rather than seek to overcome death and live for ever here on earth. The best minds were busy giving meaning to death, not trying to escape it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is the theme of the most ancient myth to come down to us – the Gilgamesh myth  of  ancient  Sumer.  Its  hero  is  the  strongest  and  most  capable  man  in  the world,  King  Gilgamesh  of  Uruk,  who  could  defeat  anyone  in  battle.  One  day, Gilgamesh’s best friend, Enkidu, died. Gilgamesh sat by the body and observed it for many days, until he saw a worm dropping out of his friend’s nostril. At that moment  Gilgamesh  was  gripped  by  a  terrible  horror,  and  he  resolved  that  he himself  would  never  die.  He  would  somehow  nd  a  way  to  defeat  death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gilgamesh  then  undertook  a  journey  to  the  end  of  the  universe,  killing  lions, battling  scorpion-men  and  nding  his  way  into  the  underworld.  There  he shattered the stone giants of Urshanabi and the ferryman of the river of the dead, and found Utnapishtim, the last survivor of the primordial  ood. Yet Gilgamesh failed in his quest. He returned home empty-handed, as mortal as ever, but with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a>one new piece of wisdom. When the gods created man, Gilgamesh had learned, they set death as man’s inevitable destiny, and man must learn to live with it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disciples  of  progress  do  not  share  this  defeatist  attitude.  For  men  of  science, death is not an inevitable destiny, but merely a technical problem. People die not because the gods decreed it, but due to various technical failures – a heart attack, cancer, an infection. And every technical problem has a technical solution. If the heart  utters, it can be stimulated by a pacemaker or replaced by a new heart. If cancer rampages, it can be killed with drugs or radiation. If bacteria proliferate, they  can  be  subdued  with  antibiotics.  True,  at  present  we  cannot  solve  all technical problems. But we are working on them. Our best minds are not wasting their time trying to give meaning to death. Instead, they are busy investigating the physiological, hormonal and genetic systems responsible for disease and old age. They are developing new medicines, revolutionary treatments and arti cial organs that will lengthen our lives and might one day vanquish the Grim Reaper himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until  recently,  you  would  not  have  heard  scientists,  or  anyone  else,  speak  so bluntly.  ‘Defeat  death?!  What  nonsense!  We  are  only trying  to  cure  cancer, tuberculosis  and  Alzheimer’s  disease,’  they  insisted.  People  avoided  the  issue  of death  because  the  goal  seemed  too  elusive.  Why  create  unreasonable expectations?  We’re  now  at  a  point,  however,  where  we  can  be  frank  about  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The leading project of the Scienti c Revolution is to give humankind eternal life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if killing death seems a distant goal, we have already achieved things that were inconceivable a few centuries ago. In 1199, King Richard the Lionheart was struck by an arrow in his left shoulder. Today we’d say he incurred a minor injury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in 1199, in the absence of antibiotics and e ective sterilisation methods, this minor  esh wound turned infected and gangrene set in. The only way to stop the spread  of  gangrene  in  twelfth-century  Europe  was  to  cut  o   the  infected  limb, impossible when the infection was in a shoulder. The gangrene spread through the Lionheart’s  body  and  no  one  could  help  the  king.  He  died  in  great  agony  two weeks later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As recently as the nineteenth century, the best doctors still did not know how to prevent  infection  and  stop  the  putrefaction  of  tissues.  In  eld  hospitals  doctors routinely  cut  o   the  hands  and  legs  of  soldiers  who  received  even  minor  limb injuries,  fearing  gangrene.  These  amputations,  as  well  as  all  other  medical procedures  (such  as  tooth  extraction),  were  done  without  any  anaesthetics.  The rst  anaesthetics  –  ether,  chloroform  and  morphine  –  entered  regular  usage  in Western medicine only in the middle of the nineteenth century. Before the advent of  chloroform,  four  soldiers  had  to  hold  down  a  wounded  comrade  while  the doctor  sawed  o   the  injured  limb.  On  the  morning  after  the  battle  of  Waterloo (1815),  heaps  of  sawn-o   hands  and  legs  could  be  seen  adjacent  to  the  eld</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>hospitals. In those days, carpenters and butchers who enlisted to the army were often sent to serve in the medical corps, because surgery required little more than knowing your way with knives and saws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the two centuries since Waterloo, things have changed beyond recognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pills, injections and sophisticated operations save us from a spate of illnesses and injuries  that  once  dealt  an  inescapable  death  sentence.  They  also  protect  us against  countless  daily  aches  and  ailments,  which  premodern  people  simply accepted as part of life. The average life expectancy jumped from around twenty-five to forty years, to around sixty-seven in the entire world, and to around eighty years in the developed world. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Death  su ered  its  worst  setbacks  in  the  arena  of  child  mortality.  Until  the twentieth  century,  between  a  quarter  and  a  third  of  the  children  of  agricultural societies never reached adulthood. Most succumbed to childhood diseases such as diphtheria,  measles  and  smallpox.  In  seventeenth-century  England,  150  out  of every 1,000 newborns died during their  rst year, and a third of all children were dead before they reached  fteen. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">9</a> Today, only  ve out of 1,000 English babies die during their first year, and only seven out of 1,000 die before age fifteen. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">10</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  can  better  grasp  the  full  impact  of  these  gures  by  setting  aside  statistics and  telling  some  stories.  A  good  example  is  the  family  of  King  Edward  I  of England  (1237–1307)  and  his  wife,  Queen  Eleanor  (1241–90).  Their  children enjoyed  the  best  conditions  and  the  most  nurturing  surroundings  that  could  be provided  in  medieval  Europe.  They  lived  in  palaces,  ate  as  much  food  as  they liked,  had  plenty  of  warm  clothing,  well-stocked  replaces,  the  cleanest  water available, an army of servants and the best doctors. The sources mention sixteen children that Queen Eleanor bore between 1255 and 1284:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1</b>. An anonymous daughter, born in 1255, died at birth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2</b>. A daughter, Catherine, died either at age one or age three. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">3</b>. A daughter, Joan, died at six months. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">4</b>. A son, John, died at age five. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">5</b>. A son, Henry, died at age six. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">6</b>. A daughter, Eleanor, died at age twenty-nine. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">7</b>. An anonymous daughter died at five months. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">8</b>. A daughter, Joan, died at age thirty-five. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">9</b>. A son, Alphonso, died at age ten. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">10</b>. A daughter, Margaret, died at age fifty-eight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a><b class="calibre3">11</b>. A daughter, Berengeria, died at age two. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">12</b>. An anonymous daughter died shortly after birth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">13</b>. A daughter, Mary, died at age fifty-three. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">14</b>. An anonymous son died shortly after birth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">15</b>. A daughter, Elizabeth, died at age thirty-four. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">16</b>. A son, Edward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The youngest, Edward, was the  rst of the boys to survive the dangerous years of childhood, and at his fathers death he ascended the English throne as King Edward II. In other words, it took Eleanor sixteen tries to carry out the most fundamental mission of an English queen – to provide her husband with a male heir. Edward II’s mother must have been a woman of exceptional patience and fortitude. Not so the woman Edward chose for his wife, Isabella of France. She had him murdered when he was forty-three. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">11</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">To the best of our knowledge, Eleanor and Edward I were a healthy couple and passed no fatal hereditary illnesses on to their children. Nevertheless, ten out of the sixteen – 62 per cent – died during childhood. Only six managed to live beyond the  age  of  eleven,  and  only  three  –  just  18  per  cent  –  lived  beyond  the  age  of forty. In addition to these births, Eleanor most likely had a number of pregnancies that  ended  in  miscarriage.  On  average,  Edward  and  Eleanor  lost  a  child  every three  years,  ten  children  one  after  another.  It’s  nearly  impossible  for  a  parent today to imagine such loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  long  will  the  Gilgamesh  Project  –  the  quest  for  immortality  –  take  to complete?  A  hundred  years?  Five  hundred  years?  A  thousand  years?  When  we recall  how  little  we  knew  about  the  human  body  in  1900,  and  how  much knowledge  we  have  gained  in  a  single  century,  there  is  cause  for  optimism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genetic engineers have recently managed to double the average life expectancy of <i class="calibre4">Caenorhabditis  elegans</i>  worms. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">12</a>  Could  they  do  the  same  for  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nanotechnology  experts  are  developing  a  bionic  immune  system  composed  of millions  of  nano-robots,  who  would  inhabit  our  bodies,  open  blocked  blood vessels,  ght  viruses  and  bacteria,  eliminate cancerous  cells  and  even  reverse ageing processes. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">13 </a>A few serious scholars suggest that by 2050, some humans will become a-mortal (not immortal, because they could still die of some accident, but a-mortal,  meaning  that  in  the  absence  of  fatal  trauma  their  lives  could  be extended indefinitely). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether  or  not  Project  Gilgamesh  succeeds,  from  a  historical  perspective  it  is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>fascinating  to  see  that  most  late-modern  religions  and  ideologies  have  already taken  death  and  the  afterlife  out  of  the  equation.  Until  the  eighteenth  century, religions  considered  death  and  its  aftermath  central  to  the  meaning  of  life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beginning in the eighteenth century, religions and ideologies such as liberalism, socialism and feminism lost all interest in the afterlife. What, exactly, happens to a Communist after he or she dies? What happens to a capitalist? What happens to a feminist? It is pointless to look for the answer in the writings of Marx, Adam Smith or Simone de Beauvoir. The only modern ideology that still awards death a central role is nationalism. In its more poetic and desperate moments, nationalism promises  that  whoever  dies  for  the  nation  will  forever  live  in  its  collective memory.  Yet  this  promise  is  so  fuzzy  that  even  most  nationalists  do  not  really know what to make of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Sugar Daddy of Science</p>
<p class="calibre1">We are living in a technical age. Many are convinced that science and technology hold  the  answers  to  all  our  problems.  We  should  just  let  the  scientists  and technicians go on with their work, and they will create heaven here on earth. But science is not an enterprise that takes place on some superior moral or spiritual plane  above  the  rest  of  human  activity.  Like  all  other  parts  of  our  culture,  it  is shaped by economic, political and religious interests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Science is a very expensive a air. A biologist seeking to understand the human immune  system  requires  laboratories,  test  tubes,  chemicals  and  electron microscopes, not to mention lab assistants, electricians, plumbers and cleaners. An economist  seeking  to  model  credit  markets  must  buy  computers,  set  up  giant databanks  and  develop  complicated  data-processing  programs.  An  archaeologist who wishes to understand the behaviour of archaic hunter-gatherers must travel to distant lands, excavate ancient ruins and date fossilised bones and artefacts. All of this costs money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the past 500 years modern science has achieved wonders thanks largely to the willingness of governments, businesses, foundations and private donors to channel billions of dollars into scienti c research. These billions have done much more  to  chart  the  universe,  map  the  planet  and  catalogue  the  animal  kingdom than  did  Galileo  Galilei,  Christopher  Columbus  and  Charles  Darwin.  If  these particular  geniuses  had  never  been  born,  their  insights  would  probably  have occurred  to  others.  But  if  the  proper  funding  were  unavailable,  no  intellectual brilliance could have compensated for that. If Darwin had never been born, for example,  we’d  today  attribute  the  theory  of  evolution  to  Alfred  Russel  Wallace, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a>who  came  up  with  the  idea  of  evolution  via  natural  selection  independently  of Darwin and just a few years later. But if the European powers had not  nanced geographical, zoological and botanical research around the world, neither Darwin nor Wallace would have had the necessary empirical data to develop the theory of evolution. It is likely that they would not even have tried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why  did  the  billions  start  owing  from  government  and  business  co ers  into labs and universities? In academic circles, many are naïve enough to believe in pure science. They believe that government and business altruistically give them money  to  pursue  whatever  research  projects  strike  their  fancy.  But  this  hardly describes the realities of science funding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  scienti c  studies  are  funded  because  somebody  believes  they  can  help attain  some  political,  economic  or  religious  goal.  For  example,  in  the  sixteenth century,  kings  and  bankers  channelled  enormous  resources  to  nance</p>
<p class="calibre1">geographical  expeditions  around  the  world  but  not  a  penny  for  studying  child psychology. This is because kings and bankers surmised that the discovery of new geographical  knowledge  would  enable  them  to  conquer  new  lands  and  set  up trade  empires,  whereas  they  couldn’t  see  any  pro t  in  understanding  child psychology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  1940s  the  governments  of  America  and  the  Soviet  Union  channelled enormous  resources  to  the  study  of  nuclear  physics  rather than  underwater archaeology. They surmised that studying nuclear physics would enable them to develop nuclear weapons, whereas underwater archaeology was unlikely to help win wars. Scientists themselves are not always aware of the political, economic and religious interests that control the  ow of money; many scientists do, in fact, act out of pure intellectual curiosity. However, only rarely do scientists dictate the scientific agenda. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if we wanted to  nance pure science una ected by political, economic or religious  interests,  it  would  probably  be  impossible.  Our  resources  are  limited, after  all.  Ask  a  congressman  to  allocate  an  additional  million  dollars  to  the National Science Foundation for basic research, and he’ll justi ably ask whether that money wouldn’t be better used to fund teacher training or to give a needed tax  break  to  a  troubled  factory  in  his  district.  To  channel  limited  resources  we must answer questions such as ‘What is more important?’ and ‘What is good?’ And these  are  not  scienti c  questions.  Science  can  explain  what  exists  in  the  world, how  things  work,  and  what  might  be  in  the  future.  By  de nition,  it  has  no pretensions to knowing what  <i class="calibre4">should</i> be in the future. Only religions and ideologies seek to answer such questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider  the  following  quandary:  two  biologists  from  the  same  department, possessing  the  same  professional  skills,  have  both  applied  for  a  million-dollar grant to  nance their current research projects. Professor Slughorn wants to study</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>a disease that infects the udders of cows, causing a 10 per cent decrease in their milk  production.  Professor  Sprout  wants  to  study  whether  cows  su er  mentally when they are separated from their calves. Assuming that the amount of money is limited,  and  that  it  is  impossible  to  nance  both  research  projects,  which  one should be funded? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no scienti c answer to this question. There are only political, economic and religious answers. In today’s world, it is obvious that Slughorn has a better chance of getting the money. Not because udder diseases are scienti cally more interesting than bovine mentality, but because the dairy industry, which stands to bene t from the research, has more political and economic clout than the animal-rights lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  in  a  strict  Hindu  society,  where  cows  are  sacred,  or  in  a society committed to animal rights, Professor Sprout would have a better shot. But as long as  she  lives  in  a  society  that  values  the  commercial  potential  of  milk  and  the health  of  its  human  citizens  over  the  feelings  of  cows,  she’d  best  write  up  her research proposal so as to appeal to those assumptions. For example, she might write that ‘Depression leads to a decrease in milk production. If we understand the mental  world  of  dairy  cows,  we  could  develop  psychiatric  medication  that  will improve their mood, thus raising milk production by up to 10 per cent. I estimate that  there  is  a  global  annual  market  of  $250  million  for  bovine  psychiatric medications.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Science  is  unable  to  set  its  own  priorities.  It  is  also  incapable  of  determining what to do with its discoveries. For example, from a purely scienti c viewpoint it is  unclear  what  we  should  do  with  our  increasing  understanding  of  genetics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should  we  use  this  knowledge  to  cure  cancer,  to  create  a  race  of  genetically engineered  supermen,  or  to  engineer  dairy  cows  with  super-sized  udders?  It  is obvious that a liberal government, a Communist government, a Nazi government and a capitalist business corporation would use the very same scienti c discovery for  completely  di erent  purposes,  and  there  is  no  <i class="calibre4">scientific</i> reason to prefer one usage over others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, scienti c research can  ourish only in alliance with some religion or ideology. The ideology justi es the costs of the research. In exchange, the ideology in uences the scienti c agenda and determines what to do with the discoveries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence in order to comprehend how humankind has reached Alamogordo and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moon – rather than any number of alternative destinations – it is not enough to survey the achievements of physicists, biologists and sociologists. We have to take into  account  the  ideological,  political  and  economic  forces  that  shaped  physics, biology and sociology, pushing them in certain directions while neglecting others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two forces in particular deserve our attention: imperialism and capitalism. The feedback  loop  between  science,  empire  and  capital  has  arguably  been  history’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>chief engine for the past 500 years. The following chapters analyse its workings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First we’ll look at how the twin turbines of science and empire were latched to one another,  and  then  learn  how  both  were  hitched  up  to  the  money  pump  of capitalism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Marriage of Science and Empire</p>
<p class="calibre1">HOW  FAR  IS  THE  SUN  FROM  THE  EARTH?  It’s  a  question  that  intrigued  many early  modern  astronomers,  particularly  after  Copernicus  argued  that  the  sun, rather  than  the  earth,  is  located  at  the  centre  of  the  universe.  A  number  of astronomers and mathematicians tried to calculate the distance, but their methods provided widely varying results. A reliable means of making the measurement was nally  proposed  in  the  middle  of  the  eighteenth  century.  Every  few  years,  the planet Venus passes directly between the sun and the earth. The duration of the transit di ers when seen from distant points on the earths surface because of the tiny di erence in the angle at which the observer sees it. If several observations of the same transit were made from different continents, simple trigonometry was all it would take to calculate our exact distance from the sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Astronomers  predicted  that  the  next  Venus  transits  would  occur  in  1761  and 1769. So expeditions were sent from Europe to the four corners of the world in order  to  observe  the  transits  from  as  many  distant  points  as  possible.  In  1761</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientists observed the transit from Siberia, North America, Madagascar and South Africa.  As  the  1769  transit  approached,  the  European  scienti c  community mounted  a  supreme  e ort,  and  scientists  were  dispatched  as  far  as  northern Canada  and  California  (which  was  then  a  wilderness).  The  Royal  Society  of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge concluded that this was not enough.  To  obtain  the  most  accurate  results  it  was  imperative  to  send  an astronomer all the way to the south-western Pacific Ocean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Royal  Society  resolved  to  send  an  eminent  astronomer, Charles  Green,  to Tahiti,  and  spared  neither  e ort  nor  money.  But,  since  it  was  funding  such  an expensive  expedition,  it  hardly  made  sense  to  use  it  to  make  just  a  single astronomical  observation.  Green  was  therefore  accompanied  by  a  team  of  eight other  scientists  from  several  disciplines,  headed  by  botanists  Joseph  Banks  and Daniel Solander. The team also included artists assigned to produce drawings of the  new  lands,  plants,  animals  and  peoples  that  the  scientists  would  no  doubt encounter. Equipped with the most advanced scienti c instruments that Banks and the  Royal  Society  could  buy,  the  expedition  was  placed  under  the  command  of Captain  James  Cook,  an  experienced  seaman  as  well  as  an  accomplished</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>geographer and ethnographer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The expedition left England in 1768, observed the Venus transit from Tahiti in 1769, reconnoitred several Paci c islands, visited Australia and New Zealand, and returned to England in 1771. It brought back enormous quantities of astronomical, geographical, meteorological, botanical, zoological and anthropological data. Its ndings  made  major  contributions  to  a  number  of  disciplines,  sparked  the imagination of Europeans with astonishing tales of the South Paci c, and inspired future generations of naturalists and astronomers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the  elds that bene ted from the Cook expedition was medicine. At the time,  ships  that  set  sail  to  distant  shores  knew  that  more  than  half  their  crew members  would  die  on  the  journey.  The  nemesis  was  not  angry  natives,  enemy warships  or  homesickness.  It  was  a  mysterious  ailment  called  scurvy.  Men  who came  down  with  the  disease  grew  lethargic  and  depressed,  and  their  gums  and other soft tissues bled. As the disease progressed, their teeth fell out, open sores appeared  and  they  grew  feverish,  jaundiced,  and  lost  control  of  their  limbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between  the  sixteenth  and  eighteenth  centuries,  scurvy  is  estimated  to  have claimed the lives of about 2 million sailors. No one knew what caused it, and no matter  what  remedy  was  tried,  sailors  continued  to  die  in  droves.  The  turning point came in 1747, when a British physician, James Lind, conducted a controlled experiment  on  sailors  who  su ered  from  the  disease.  He  separated  them  into several groups and gave each group a di erent treatment. One of the test groups was instructed to eat citrus fruits, a common folk remedy for scurvy. The patients in  this  group  promptly  recovered. Lind  did  not  know  what  the  citrus  fruits  had that the sailors’ bodies lacked, but we now know that it is vitamin C. A typical shipboard  diet  at  that  time  was  notably  lacking  in  foods  that  are  rich  in  this essential nutrient. On long-range voyages sailors usually subsisted on biscuits and beef jerky, and ate almost no fruits or vegetables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Royal Navy was not convinced by Lind’s experiments, but James Cook was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He resolved to prove the doctor right. He loaded his boat with a large quantity of sauerkraut  and  ordered  his  sailors  to  eat  lots  of  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables whenever the expedition made landfall. Cook did not lose a single sailor to scurvy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the following decades, all the world’s navies adopted Cook’s nautical diet, and the lives of countless sailors and passengers were saved. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the Cook expedition had another, far less benign result. Cook was not only an experienced seaman and geographer, but also a naval o cer. The Royal Society  nanced a large part of the expedition’s expenses, but the ship itself was provided  by  the  Royal  Navy.  The  navy  also  seconded  eighty- ve  well-armed sailors  and  marines,  and  equipped  the  ship  with  artillery,  muskets,  gunpowder and  other  weaponry.  Much  of  the  information  collected  by  the  expedition particularly  the  astronomical,  geographical,  meteorological  and  anthropological</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>data – was of obvious political and military value. The discovery of an e ective treatment  for  scurvy  greatly  contributed  to  British  control  of  the  world’s  oceans and  its  ability  to  send  armies  to  the  other  side  of  the  world.  Cook  claimed  for Britain many of the islands and lands he ‘discovered’, most notably Australia. The Cook  expedition  laid  the  foundation  for  the  British  occupation  of  the  south-western Paci c Ocean; for the conquest of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand; for  the  settlement  of  millions  of  Europeans  in  the  new  colonies;  and  for  the extermination of their native cultures and most of their native populations. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the century following the Cook expedition, the most fertile lands of Australia and  New  Zealand  were  taken  from  their  previous  inhabitants  by  European settlers.  The  native  population  dropped  by  up  to  90  per  cent  and  the  survivors were  subjected  to  a  harsh  regime  of  racial  oppression.  For  the  Aborigines  of Australia and the Maoris of New Zealand, the Cook expedition was the beginning of a catastrophe from which they have never recovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An even worse fate befell the natives of Tasmania. Having survived for 10,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">years  in  splendid  isolation,  they  were  completely  wiped  out,  to  the  last  man, woman and child, within a century of Cook’s arrival. European settlers  rst drove them  o   the  richest  parts  of  the  island,  and  then,  coveting  even  the  remaining wilderness, hunted them down and killed them systematically. The few survivors were  hounded  into  an  evangelical  concentration  camp,  where  well-meaning  but not particularly open-minded missionaries tried to indoctrinate them in the ways of  the  modern  world.  The  Tasmanians  were  instructed  in  reading  and  writing, Christianity and various ‘productive skills’ such as sewing clothes and farming. But they  refused  to  learn.  They  became  ever  more  melancholic,  stopped  having children, lost all interest in life, and  nally chose the only escape route from the modern world of science and progress – death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alas, science and progress pursued them even to the afterlife. The corpses of the last  Tasmanians  were  seized  in  the  name  of  science  by  anthropologists  and curators.  They  were  dissected,  weighed  and  measured,  and  analysed  in  learned articles.  The  skulls  and  skeletons  were  then  put  on  display  in  museums  and anthropological collections. Only in 1976 did the Tasmanian Museum give up for burial  the  skeleton  of  Truganini,  the  last  native  Tasmanian,  who  had  died  a hundred years earlier. The English Royal College of Surgeons held on to samples of her skin and hair until 2002. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was  Cook’s  ship  a  scienti c  expedition  protected  by  a  military  force  or  a military expedition with a few scientists tagging along? That’s like asking whether your petrol tank is half empty or half full. It was both. The Scienti c Revolution and  modern  imperialism  were  inseparable.  People  such  as  Captain  James  Cook and the botanist Joseph Banks could hardly distinguish science from empire. Nor could luckless Truganini. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a><img src="index-239_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Why Europe? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that people from a large island in the northern Atlantic conquered a large island  south  of  Australia  is  one  of  history’s  more  bizarre  occurrences.  Not  long before Cook’s expedition, the British Isles and western Europe in general were but distant  backwaters  of  the  Mediterranean  world.  Little  of  importance  ever happened  there.  Even  the  Roman  Empire  –  the  only  important  premodern European empire – derived most of its wealth from its North African, Balkan and Middle Eastern provinces. Rome’s western European provinces were a poor Wild West,  which  contributed  little  aside  from  minerals  and  slaves.  Northern  Europe was so desolate and barbarous that it wasn’t even worth conquering. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Only  at  the  end  of  the  fteenth  century  did  Europe  become  a  hothouse  of important military, political, economic and cultural developments. Between 1500</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  1750,  western  Europe  gained  momentum  and  became  master  of  the  ‘Outer World’,  meaning  the  two  American  continents  and  the  oceans.  Yet  even  then</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>Europe  was  no  match  for  the  great  powers  of  Asia.  Europeans  managed  to conquer  America  and  gain  supremacy  at  sea  mainly  because  the  Asiatic powers showed  little  interest  in  them.  The  early  modern  era  was  a  golden  age  for  the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean, the Safavid Empire in Persia, the Mughal Empire in India, and the Chinese Ming and Qing dynasties. They expanded their territories  signi cantly  and  enjoyed  unprecedented  demographic  and  economic growth.  In  1775  Asia  accounted  for  80  per  cent  of  the  world  economy.  The combined  economies  of  India  and  China  alone  represented  two-thirds  of  global production. In comparison, Europe was an economic dwarf. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  global  centre  of  power  shifted  to  Europe  only  between  1750  and  1850, when Europeans humiliated the Asian powers in a series of wars and conquered large parts of Asia. By 1900 Europeans  rmly controlled the worlds economy and most  of  its  territory.  In  1950  western  Europe  and  the  United  States  together accounted  for  more  than  half  of  global  production,  whereas  Chinas  portion  had been reduced to 5 per cent. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">4</a> Under the European aegis a new global order and global culture emerged. Today all humans are, to a much greater extent than they usually want to admit, European in dress, thought and taste. They may be  ercely anti-European in their rhetoric, but almost everyone on the planet views politics, medicine, war and economics through European eyes, and listens to music written in European modes with words in European languages. Even today’s burgeoning Chinese  economy,  which  may  soon  regain  its  global  primacy,  is  built  on  a European model of production and finance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did the people of this frigid  nger of Eurasia manage to break out of their remote corner of the globe and conquer the entire world? Europe’s scientists are often  given  much  of  the  credit.  It’s  unquestionable  that  from  1850  onward European domination rested to a large extent on the military–industrial–scienti c complex and technological wizardry. All successful late modern empires cultivated scienti c research in the hope of harvesting technological innovations, and many scientists spent most of their time working on arms, medicines and machines for their imperial masters. A common saying among European soldiers facing African enemies was, ‘Come what may, we have machine guns, and they don’t.’ Civilian technologies  were  no  less  important.  Canned  food  fed  soldiers,  railroads  and steamships  transported  soldiers  and  their  provisions,  while a  new  arsenal  of medicines  cured  soldiers,  sailors  and  locomotive  engineers.  These  logistical advances played a more signi cant role in the European conquest of Africa than did the machine gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that wasn’t the case before 1850. The military-industrial-scienti c complex was still in its infancy; the technological fruits of the Scienti c Revolution were unripe; and the technological gap between European, Asiatic and African powers was  small.  In  1770,  James  Cook  certainly  had  far  better  technology  than  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>Australian  Aborigines,  but  so  did  the  Chinese  and  the  Ottomans.  Why  then  was Australia explored and colonised by Captain James Cook and not by Captain Wan Zhengse or Captain Hussein Pasha? More importantly, if in 1770 Europeans had no  signi cant  technological  advantage  over  Muslims,  Indians  and  Chinese,  how did they manage in the following century to open such a gap between themselves and the rest of the world? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why did the military-industrial-scienti c complex blossom in Europe rather than India? When Britain leaped forward, why were France, Germany and the United States  quick  to  follow,  whereas  China  lagged  behind?  When  the  gap  between industrial  and  non-industrial  nations  became  an  obvious  economic  and  political factor,  why  did  Russia,  Italy  and  Austria  succeed  in  closing  it,  whereas  Persia, Egypt  and  the  Ottoman  Empire  failed?  After  all,  the  technology  of  the  rst industrial wave was relatively simple. Was it so hard for Chinese or Ottomans to engineer steam engines, manufacture machine guns and lay down railroads? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The world’s  rst commercial railroad opened for business in 1830, in Britain. By 1850, Western nations were criss-crossed by almost 40,000 kilometres of railroads</p>
<p class="calibre1">–  but  in  the  whole  of  Asia,  Africa  and  Latin  America  there  were  only  4,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">kilometres of tracks. In 1880, the West boasted more than 350,000 kilometres of railroads,  whereas  in  the  rest  of  the  world  there  were  but  35,000  kilometres  of train lines (and most of these were laid by the British in India). <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">5</a> The  rst railroad in  China  opened  only  in  1876.  It  was  twenty- ve  kilometres  long  and  built  by Europeans – the Chinese government destroyed it the following year. In 1880 the Chinese Empire did not operate a single railroad. The  rst railroad in Persia was built  only  in  1888,  and  it  connected  Tehran  with  a  Muslim  holy  site  about  ten kilometres  south  of the  capital.  It  was  constructed  and  operated  by  a  Belgian company. In 1950, the total railway network of Persia still amounted to a meagre 2,500 kilometres, in a country seven times the size of Britain. <a href="index_split_005.html#p360">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Chinese and Persians did not lack technological inventions such as steam engines (which could be freely copied or bought). They lacked the values, myths, judicial  apparatus  and  sociopolitical  structures  that  took  centuries  to  form  and mature  in  the  West  and  which  could  not  be  copied  and  internalised  rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">France  and  the  United  States  quickly  followed  in  Britain’s  footsteps  because  the French and Americans already shared the most important British myths and social structures. The Chinese and Persians could not catch up as quickly because they thought and organised their societies differently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This explanation sheds new light on the period from 1500 to 1850. During this era  Europe  did  not  enjoy  any  obvious  technological,  political,  military  or economic advantage over the Asian powers, yet the continent built up a unique potential, whose importance suddenly became obvious around 1850. The apparent equality  between  Europe,  China  and  the  Muslim  world  in  1750  was  a  mirage. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>Imagine  two  builders,  each  busy  constructing  very  tall  towers.  One  builder  uses wood and mud bricks, whereas the other uses steel and concrete. At  rst it seems that there is not much of a di erence between the two methods, since both towers grow  at  a  similar  pace  and  reach  a  similar  height.  However,  once  a  critical threshold  is  crossed,  the  wood  and  mud  tower  cannot  stand  the  strain  and collapses, whereas the steel and concrete tower grows storey by storey, as far as the eye can see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern world? There are two complementary answers to this question:  modern  science  and  capitalism.  Europeans  were  used  to  thinking  and behaving  in  a  scienti c  and  capitalist  way  even  before  they  enjoyed  any signi cant  technological  advantages.  When  the  technological  bonanza  began, Europeans  could  harness  it  far  better  than  anybody  else.  So  it  is  hardly coincidental  that  science  and  capitalism  form  the  most  important  legacy  that European imperialism has bequeathed the post-European world of the twenty- rst century. Europe and Europeans no longer rule the world, but science and capital are  growing  ever  stronger.  The  victories  of  capitalism  are  examined  in  the following chapter. This chapter is dedicated to the love story between European imperialism and modern science. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Mentality of Conquest</p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern  science  ourished  in  and  thanks  to  European  empires.  The  discipline obviously  owes  a  huge  debt  to  ancient  scienti c  traditions,  such  as  those  of classical  Greece,  China,  India  and  Islam,  yet  its  unique  character  began  to  take shape only in the early modern period, hand in hand with the imperial expansion of Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, Russia and the Netherlands. During the early modern  period,  Chinese,  Indians,  Muslims,  Native  Americans  and  Polynesians continued  to  make  important  contributions  to  the  Scienti c  Revolution.  The insights  of  Muslim  economists  were  studied  by  Adam  Smith  and  Karl  Marx, treatments  pioneered  by  Native  American  doctors  found  their  way  into  English medical  texts  and  data  extracted  from  Polynesian  informants  revolutionised Western  anthropology.  But  until  the  mid-twentieth  century,  the  people  who collated  these  myriad  scienti c  discoveries,  creating  scienti c  disciplines  in  the process,  were  the  ruling  and  intellectual  elites  of  the  global  European  empires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Far East and the Islamic world produced minds as intelligent and curious as those of Europe. However, between 1500 and 1950 they did not produce anything that comes even close to Newtonian physics or Darwinian biology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>This does not mean that Europeans have a unique gene for science, or that they will forever dominate the study of physics and biology. Just as Islam began as an Arab  monopoly  but  was  subsequently  taken  over  by  Turks  and  Persians,  so modern  science  began  as  a  European  speciality,  but  is  today  becoming  a  multi-ethnic enterprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  forged  the  historical  bond  between  modern  science  and  European imperialism? Technology was an important factor in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but in the early modern era it was of limited importance. The key factor was that the plant-seeking botanist and the colony-seeking naval o cer shared a similar mindset. Both scientist and conqueror began by admitting ignorance – they both said, ‘I don’t know what’s out there.’ They both felt compelled to go out and make  new  discoveries.  And  they  both  hoped  the  new  knowledge  thus  acquired would make them masters of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  imperialism  was  entirely  unlike  all  other  imperial  projects  in  history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Previous  seekers  of  empire  tended  to  assume  that  they  already  understood  the world. Conquest merely utilised and spread  <i class="calibre4">their</i> view of the world. The Arabs, to name  one  example,  did  not  conquer  Egypt,  Spain  or  India  in  order  to  discover something  they  did  not  know.  The  Romans,  Mongols  and  Aztecs  voraciously conquered  new  lands  in  search  of  power  and  wealth  –  not  of  knowledge.  In contrast, European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories. </p>
