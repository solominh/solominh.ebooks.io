<p class="calibre1">An Animal of No Significance</p>
<p class="calibre1">ABOUT 13.5 BILLION YEARS AGO, MATTER, energy, time and space came into</p>
<p class="calibre1">being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  300,000  years  after  their  appearance,  matter  and  energy  started  to coalesce  into  complex  structures,  called  atoms,  which  then  combined  into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  3.8  billion  years  ago,  on  a  planet  called  Earth,  certain  molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called biology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  70,000  years  ago,  organisms  belonging  to  the  species  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i> started  to  form  even  more  elaborate  structures  called  cultures.  The  subsequent development of these human cultures is called history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three  important  revolutions  shaped  the  course  of  history:  the  Cognitive Revolution  kick-started  history  about  70,000  years  ago.  The  Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scienti c Revolution, which got under  way  only  500  years  ago,  may  well  end  history  and  start  something completely di erent. This book tells the story of how these three revolutions have affected humans and their fellow organisms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  humans  long  before  there  was  history.  Animals  much  like  modern humans  rst appeared about 2.5 million years ago. But for countless generations they did not stand out from the myriad other organisms with which they shared their habitats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On a hike in East Africa 2 million years ago, you might well have encountered a familiar  cast  of  human  characters:  anxious  mothers  cuddling  their  babies  and clutches  of  carefree  children  playing  in  the  mud;  temperamental  youths  cha ng against  the  dictates  of  society  and  weary  elders  who  just  wanted  to  be  left  in peace;  chest-thumping  machos  trying  to  impress  the  local  beauty  and  wise  old matriarchs  who  had  already  seen  it  all.  These  archaic  humans  loved,  played, formed  close  friendships  and  competed  for  status  and  power  –  but  so  did chimpanzees,  baboons  and  elephants.  There  was  nothing  special  about  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>Nobody,  least  of  all  humans  themselves,  had  any  inkling  that  their  descendants would  one  day  walk  on  the  moon,  split  the  atom,  fathom  the  genetic  code  and write history books. The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were insigni cant animals with no more impact on their environment than gorillas, fireflies or jellyfish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Biologists  classify  organisms  into  species.  Animals  are  said  to  belong  to  the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to fertile o spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horses  and  donkeys  have  a  recent  common  ancestor  and  share  many  physical traits.  But  they  show  little  sexual  interest  in  one  another.  They  will  mate  if induced  to  do  so  –  but  their  o spring,  called  mules,  are  sterile.  Mutations  in donkey DNA can therefore never cross over to horses, or vice versa. The two types of  animals  are  consequently  considered  two  distinct  species,  moving  along separate evolutionary paths. By contrast, a bulldog and a spaniel may look very di erent, but they are members of the same species, sharing the same DNA pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They will happily mate and their puppies will grow up to pair o  with other dogs and produce more puppies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Species that evolved from a common ancestor are bunched together under the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heading ‘genus’ (plural genera). Lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars are di erent species within the genus  <i class="calibre4">Panthera</i>. Biologists label organisms with a two-part Latin name, genus followed by species. Lions, for example, are called  <i class="calibre4">Panthera leo</i>, the species  <i class="calibre4">leo</i>  of  the  genus  <i class="calibre4">Panthera</i>.  Presumably,  everyone  reading  this  book  is  a <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens –</i> the species  <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i> (wise) of the genus  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> (man). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genera in their turn are grouped into families, such as the cats (lions, cheetahs, house  cats),  the  dogs  (wolves,  foxes,  jackals)  and  the  elephants  (elephants, mammoths,  mastodons).  All  members  of  a  family  trace  their  lineage  back  to  a founding  matriarch  or  patriarch.  All  cats,  for  example,  from  the  smallest  house kitten to the most ferocious lion, share a common feline ancestor who lived about 25 million years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>,  too,  belongs  to  a  family.  This  banal  fact  used  to  be  one  of history’s most closely guarded secrets.  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> long preferred to view itself as set apart from animals, an orphan bereft of family, lacking siblings or cousins, and most importantly, without parents. But that’s just not the case. Like it or not, we  are  members  of  a  large  and  particularly  noisy  family  called  the  great  apes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  closest  living  relatives  include  chimpanzees,  gorillas  and  orang-utans.  The chimpanzees are the closest. Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters.  One  became  the  ancestor  of  all  chimpanzees,  the  other  is  our  own grandmother. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a><img src="index-12_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Skeletons in the Closet</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  has  kept  hidden  an  even  more  disturbing  secret.  Not  only  do  we possess an abundance of uncivilised cousins, once upon a time we had quite a few brothers and sisters as well. We are used to thinking about ourselves as the only humans, because for the last 10,000 years, our species has indeed been the only human  species  around.  Yet  the  real  meaning  of  the  word  human  is  ‘an  animal belonging  to  the  genus  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i>’,  and  there  used  to  be  many  other  species  of  this genus  besides  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. Moreover, as we shall see in the last chapter of the book,  in  the  not  so  distant  future  we  might  again  have  to  contend  with  non <i class="calibre4">-</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i> humans. To clarify this point, I will often use the term ‘Sapiens’ to denote members of the species  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>, while reserving the term ‘human’ to refer to all extant members of the genus  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans  rst evolved in East Africa about 2.5 million years ago from an earlier genus of apes called  <i class="calibre4">Australopithecus</i>, which means ‘Southern Ape’. About 2 million years ago, some of these archaic men and women left their homeland to journey through and settle vast areas of North Africa, Europe and Asia. Since survival in the snowy forests of northern Europe required di erent traits than those needed to stay alive in Indonesia’s steaming jungles, human populations evolved in di erent directions. The result was several distinct species, to each of which scientists have assigned a pompous Latin name. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">2. </b></a><b class="calibre3"> Our siblings, according to speculative reconstructions (left to right):</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Homo rudolfensis</b></i> <b class="calibre3">(East Africa); </b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Homo erectus</b></i> <b class="calibre3">(East Asia); and</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Homo neanderthalensis</b></i> <b class="calibre3">(Europe and</b> <b class="calibre3">western Asia). All are humans</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans in Europe and western Asia evolved into  <i class="calibre4">Homo neanderthalensis</i> (‘Man</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>from  the  Neander  Valley),  popularly  referred  to  simply  as  ‘Neanderthals’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neanderthals, bulkier and more muscular than us Sapiens, were well adapted to the cold climate of Ice Age western Eurasia. The more eastern regions of Asia were populated  by  <i class="calibre4">Homo  erectus</i>,  ‘Upright  Man’,  who  survived  there  for  close  to  2</p>
<p class="calibre1">million  years,  making  it  the  most  durable  human  species  ever.  This  record  is unlikely  to  be  broken  even  by  our  own  species.  It  is  doubtful  whether  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i> will still be around a thousand years from now, so 2 million years is really out of our league. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the island of Java, in Indonesia, lived  <i class="calibre4">Homo soloensis</i>, ‘Man from the Solo Valley’, who was suited to life in the tropics. On another Indonesian island – the small island of Flores – archaic humans underwent a process of dwar ng. Humans rst reached Flores when the sea level was exceptionally low, and the island was easily accessible from the mainland. When the seas rose again, some people were trapped on the island, which was poor in resources. Big people, who need a lot of food, died  rst. Smaller fellows survived much better. Over the generations, the people  of  Flores  became  dwarves.  This  unique  species,  known  by  scientists  as <i class="calibre4">Homo  oresiensis</i>, reached a maximum height of only one metre and weighed no more  than  twenty- ve  kilograms.  They  were  nevertheless  able  to  produce  stone tools, and even managed occasionally to hunt down some of the island’s elephants</p>
<p class="calibre1">– though, to be fair, the elephants were a dwarf species as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  2010  another  lost  sibling  was  rescued  from  oblivion,  when  scientists excavating  the  Denisova  Cave  in  Siberia  discovered  a  fossilised  nger  bone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genetic analysis proved that the  nger belonged to a previously unknown human species, which was named  <i class="calibre4">Homo denisova</i>. Who knows how many lost relatives of ours  are  waiting  to  be discovered  in  other  caves,  on  other  islands,  and  in  other climes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While these humans were evolving in Europe and Asia, evolution in East Africa did not stop. The cradle of humanity continued to nurture numerous new species, such as  <i class="calibre4">Homo rudolfensis</i>, ‘Man from Lake Rudolf’,  <i class="calibre4">Homo ergaster</i>, ‘Working Man’, and  eventually  our  own  species,  which  we’ve  immodestly  named  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wise Man’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The members of some of these species were massive and others were dwarves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some were fearsome hunters and others meek plant-gatherers. Some lived only on a single island, while many roamed over continents. But all of them belonged to the genus  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i>. They were all human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a common fallacy to envision these species as arranged in a straight line of descent, with Ergaster begetting Erectus, Erectus begetting the Neanderthals, and the  Neanderthals  evolving  into  us.  This  linear  model  gives  the  mistaken impression that at any particular moment only one type of human inhabited the earth, and that all earlier species were merely older models of ourselves. The truth</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>is that from about 2 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago, the world was  home,  at  one  and  the  same  time,  to  several  human  species.  And  why  not? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today  there  are  many  species  of  foxes,  bears  and  pigs.  The  earth  of  a  hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six di erent species of man. It’s our current exclusivity,  not  that  multi-species  past,  that  is  peculiar  –  and  perhaps incriminating. As we will shortly see, we Sapiens have good reasons to repress the memory of our siblings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Cost of Thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  their  many  di erences,  all  human  species  share  several  de ning characteristics. Most notably, humans have extraordinarily large brains compared to other animals. Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an average brain size of 200 cubic centimetres. The earliest men and women, 2.5 million years ago, had brains  of  about  600  cubic  centimetres.  Modern  Sapiens  sport  a  brain  averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic centimetres. Neanderthal brains were even bigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That evolution should select for larger brains may seem to us like, well, a no-brainer. We are so enamoured of our high intelligence that we assume that when it  comes  to  cerebral  power,  more  must  be  better.  But  if  that  were  the  case,  the feline family would also have produced cats who could do calculus. Why is genus <i class="calibre4">Homo</i>  the  only  one  in  the  entire  animal  kingdom  to  have  come  up  with  such massive thinking machines? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fact  is  that  a  jumbo  brain  is  a  jumbo  drain  on  the  body.  It’s  not  easy  to carry around, especially when encased inside a massive skull. It’s even harder to fuel.  In  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>,  the  brain  accounts  for  about  2–3  per  cent  of  total  body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  comparison,  the  brains  of  other  apes  require  only  8  per  cent  of  rest-time energy. Archaic humans paid for their large brains in two ways. Firstly, they spent more time in search of food. Secondly, their muscles atrophied. Like a government diverting money from defence to education, humans diverted energy from biceps to  neurons.  It’s  hardly  a  foregone  conclusion  that  this  is  a  good  strategy  for survival  on  the  savannah.  A  chimpanzee  can’t  win  an  argument  with  a  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i>, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today our big brains pay o  nicely, because we can produce cars and guns that enable us to move much faster than chimps, and shoot them from a safe distance instead of wrestling. But cars and guns are a recent phenomenon. For more than 2</p>
<p class="calibre1">million years, human neural networks kept growing and growing, but apart from some  int  knives  and  pointed  sticks,  humans  had  precious  little  to  show  for  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>What then drove forward the evolution of the massive human brain during those 2</p>
<p class="calibre1">million years? Frankly, we don’t know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another singular human trait is that we walk upright on two legs. Standing up, it’s  easier  to  scan  the  savannah  for  game  or  enemies,  and  arms  that  are unnecessary for locomotion are freed for other purposes, like throwing stones or signalling. The more things these hands could do, the more successful their owners were,  so  evolutionary  pressure  brought  about  an  increasing  concentration  of nerves and  nely tuned muscles in the palms and  ngers. As a result, humans can perform very intricate tasks with their hands. In particular, they can produce and use sophisticated tools. The  rst evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">million years ago, and the manufacture and use of tools are the criteria by which archaeologists recognise ancient humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  walking  upright  has  its  downside.  The  skeleton  of  our  primate  ancestors developed for millions of years to support a creature that walked on all fours and had  a  relatively  small  head.  Adjusting  to  an  upright  position  was  quite  a challenge, especially when the sca olding had to support an extra-large cranium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humankind paid for its lofty vision and industrious hands with backaches and sti necks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Women  paid  extra.  An  upright  gait  required  narrower  hips,  constricting  the birth  canal  –  and  this  just  when  babies’  heads  were  getting  bigger  and  bigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females. Women who gave birth  earlier,  when  the  infants  brain  and  head  were  still  relatively  small  and supple,  fared  better  and  lived  to  have  more  children.  Natural  selection consequently  favoured  earlier  births.  And,  indeed,  compared  to  other  animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still underdeveloped. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  fact  has  contributed  greatly  both  to  humankind’s  extraordinary  social abilities  and  to  its  unique  social  problems.  Lone  mothers  could  hardly  forage enough  food  for  their  o spring  and  themselves  with  needy  children  in  tow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raising  children  required  constant  help  from  other  family  members  and neighbours.  It  takes  a  tribe  to  raise  a  human.  Evolution  thus  favoured  those capable  of  forming  strong  social  ties.  In  addition,  since  humans  are  born underdeveloped, they can be educated and socialised to a far greater extent than any other animal. Most mammals emerge from the womb like glazed earthenware emerging  from  a  kiln  –  any  attempt  at  remoulding  will  scratch  or  break  them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans  emerge  from  the  womb  like  molten  glass  from  a  furnace.  They  can  be spun, stretched and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom. This is why today we  can  educate  our  children  to  become  Christian  or  Buddhist,  capitalist  or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>socialist, warlike or peace-loving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">We  assume  that  a  large  brain,  the  use  of  tools,  superior  learning  abilities  and complex  social  structures  are  huge  advantages.  It  seems  self-evident  that  these have made humankind the most powerful animal on earth. But humans enjoyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">all of these advantages for a full 2 million years during which they remained weak and marginal creatures. Thus humans who lived a million years ago, despite their big  brains  and  sharp  stone  tools,  dwelt  in  constant  fear  of  predators,  rarely hunted large game, and subsisted mainly by gathering plants, scooping up insects, stalking small animals, and eating the carrion left behind by other more powerful carnivores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in order to get to the marrow. Some researchers believe this was our original niche. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as woodpeckers specialise in extracting insects from the trunks of trees, the rst  humans  specialised  in  extracting  marrow  from  bones.  Why  marrow?  Well, suppose you observe a pride of lions take down and devour a gira e. You wait patiently until they’re done. But it’s still not your turn because first the hyenas and jackals – and you don’t dare interfere with them scavenge the leftovers. Only then would you and your band dare approach the carcass, look cautiously left and right</p>
<p class="calibre1">– and dig into the edible tissue that remained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  a  key  to  understanding  our  history  and  psychology.  Genus  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i>’s position  in  the  food  chain  was,  until  quite  recently,  solidly  in  the  middle.  For millions of years, humans hunted smaller creatures and gathered what they could, all the while being hunted by larger predators. It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular basis, and only in the last 100,000 years – with the rise of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens –</i> that man jumped to the top of the food chain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the ecosystem to develop  checks  and  balances  that  prevent  lions  and  sharks  from  wreaking  too much havoc. As lions became deadlier, so gazelles evolved to run faster, hyenas to cooperate  better,  and  rhinoceroses  to  be  more  bad-tempered.  In  contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust. Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust. Most top predators of the planet are majestic creatures. Millions of years of dominion have  lled them with self-con dence.  Sapiens  by  contrast  is  more  like  a  banana  republic  dictator. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and  anxieties  over  our  position,  which  makes  us  doubly  cruel  and  dangerous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  historical  calamities,  from  deadly  wars  to  ecological  catastrophes,  have resulted from this over-hasty jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A Race of Cooks</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  signi cant  step  on  the  way  to  the  top  was  the  domestication  of  re.  Some human  species  may  have  made  occasional  use  of  re  as  early  as  800,000  years ago. By about 300,000 years ago,  <i class="calibre4">Homo erectus</i>, Neanderthals and the forefathers of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> were using  re on a daily basis. Humans now had a dependable source  of  light  and  warmth,  and  a  deadly  weapon  against  prowling  lions.  Not long  afterwards,  humans  may  even  have  started  deliberately  to  torch  their neighbourhoods.  A  carefully  managed  re  could  turn  impassable  barren  thickets into prime grasslands teeming with game. In addition, once the  re died down, Stone  Age  entrepreneurs  could  walk  through  the  smoking  remains  and  harvest charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the best thing  re did was cook. Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural  forms  –  such  as  wheat,  rice  and  potatoes  –  became  staples  of  our  diet thanks to cooking. Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, it changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. Humans also had a far  easier  time  chewing  and  digesting  old  favourites  such  as  fruits,  nuts,  insects and  carrion  if  they  were  cooked.  Whereas  chimpanzees  spend  ve  hours  a  day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time  to  eating,  and  to  make  do  with  smaller  teeth  and  shorter  intestines.  Some scholars  believe  there  is  a  direct  link  between  the  advent  of  cooking,  the shortening  of  the  human intestinal  track,  and  the  growth  of  the  human  brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  long  intestines  and  large  brains  are  both  massive  energy  consumers,  it’s hard  to  have  both.  By  shortening  the  intestines  and  decreasing  their  energy consumption,  cooking  inadvertently  opened  the  way  to  the  jumbo  brains  of Neanderthals and Sapiens. <a href="index_split_005.html#p353">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fire also opened the  rst signi cant gulf between man and the other animals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  power  of  almost  all  animals  depends  on  their  bodies:  the  strength  of  their muscles,  the  size  of  their  teeth,  the  breadth  of  their  wings.  Though  they  may harness winds and currents, they are unable to control these natural forces, and are  always  constrained  by  their  physical  design.  Eagles,  for  example,  identify thermal columns rising from the ground, spread their giant wings and allow the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>hot air to lift them upwards. Yet eagles cannot control the location of the columns, and their maximum carrying capacity is strictly proportional to their wingspan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  humans  domesticated  re,  they  gained  control  of  an  obedient  and potentially limitless force. Unlike eagles, humans could choose when and where to ignite a  ame, and they were able to exploit  re for any number of tasks. Most importantly, the power of fire was not limited by the form, structure or strength of the  human  body.  A  single  woman  with  a  int  or  re  stick  could  burn  down  an entire forest in a matter of hours. The domestication of  re was a sign of things to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our Brothers’ Keepers</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  bene ts  of  re,  150,000  years  ago  humans  were  still  marginal creatures. They could now scare away lions, warm themselves during cold nights, and burn down the occasional forest. Yet counting all species together, there were still  no  more  than  perhaps  a  million  humans  living  between  the  Indonesian archipelago and the Iberian peninsula, a mere blip on the ecological radar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our own species,  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>, was already present on the world stage, but so far  it  was  just  minding  its  own  business  in  a  corner  of  Africa.  We  don’t  know exactly  where  and  when  animals  that  can  be  classi ed  as  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  rst evolved  from  some  earlier  type  of humans,  but  most  scientists  agree  that  by 150,000 years ago, East Africa was populated by Sapiens that looked just like us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If one of them turned up in a modern morgue, the local pathologist would notice nothing peculiar. Thanks to the blessings of  re, they had smaller teeth and jaws than their ancestors, whereas they had massive brains, equal in size to ours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scientists  also  agree  that  about  70,000  years  ago,  Sapiens  from  East  Africa spread into the Arabian peninsula, and from there they quickly overran the entire Eurasian landmass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  landed  in  Arabia,  most  of  Eurasia  was  already  settled  by other humans. What happened to them? There are two con icting theories. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Interbreeding Theory’ tells a story of attraction, sex and mingling. As the African immigrants  spread  around  the  world,  they  bred  with  other  human  populations, and people today are the outcome of this interbreeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  when  Sapiens  reached  the  Middle  East  and  Europe,  they encountered the Neanderthals. These humans were more muscular than Sapiens, had  larger  brains,  and  were  better  adapted  to  cold  climes.  They  used  tools  and re,  were  good  hunters,  and  apparently  took  care  of  their  sick  and  in rm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Archaeologists  have  discovered  the  bones  of  Neanderthals  who  lived  for  many</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a><img src="index-19_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">years with severe physical handicaps, evidence that they were cared for by their relatives.)  Neanderthals  are  often  depicted  in  caricatures  as  the  archetypical brutish and stupid ‘cave people’, but recent evidence has changed their image. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to the Interbreeding Theory, when Sapiens spread into Neanderthal lands, Sapiens bred with Neanderthals until the two populations merged. If this is the  case,  then  today’s  Eurasians  are  not  pure  Sapiens.  They  are  a  mixture  of Sapiens  and  Neanderthals.  Similarly,  when  Sapiens  reached  East  Asia,  they interbred  with  the  local  Erectus,  so  the  Chinese  and  Koreans  are  a  mixture  of Sapiens and Erectus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The opposing view, called the ‘Replacement Theory’ tells a very different story –</p>
<p class="calibre1">one  of  incompatibility,  revulsion,  and  perhaps  even  genocide.  According  to  this theory,  Sapiens  and  other  humans  had  di erent  anatomies,  and  most  likely di erent mating habits and even body odours. They would have had little sexual interest in one another. And even if a Neanderthal Romeo and a Sapiens Juliet fell in  love,  they  could  not  produce  fertile  children,  because  the  genetic  gulf separating  the  two  populations  was  already  unbridgeable.  The  two  populations remained completely distinct, and when the Neanderthals died out, or were killed o , their genes died with them. According to this view, Sapiens replaced all the previous human populations without merging with them. If that is the case, the lineages  of  all  contemporary  humans  can  be  traced  back,  exclusively,  to  East Africa, 70,000 years ago. We are all ‘pure Sapiens’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Map 1</b>.  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Homo sapiens</b></i> <b class="calibre3">conquers the globe</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A lot hinges on this debate. From an evolutionary perspective, 70,000 years is a relatively short interval. If the Replacement Theory is correct, all living humans have roughly the same genetic baggage, and racial distinctions among them are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>negligible.  But  if  the  Interbreeding  Theory  is  right,  there  might  well  be  genetic di erences  between  Africans,  Europeans  and  Asians  that  go  back  hundreds  of thousands  of  years.  This  is  political  dynamite,  which  could  provide  material  for explosive racial theories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In recent decades the Replacement Theory has been the common wisdom in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eld.  It  had  rmer  archaeological  backing,  and  was  more  politically  correct (scientists  had  no  desire  to  open  up  the  Pandora’s  box  of  racism  by  claiming signi cant  genetic  diversity  among modern human populations). But that ended in  2010,  when  the  results  of  a  four-year  e ort  to  map  the  Neanderthal  genome were  published.  Geneticists  were  able  to  collect  enough  intact  Neanderthal  DNA from fossils to make a broad comparison between it and the DNA of contemporary humans. The results stunned the scientific community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It turned out that 1–4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. That’s not a huge amount, but it’s  signi cant.  A  second  shock  came  several  months  later,  when  DNA  extracted from the fossilised  nger from Denisova was mapped. The results proved that up to  6  per  cent  of  the  unique  human  DNA  of  modern  Melanesians  and  Aboriginal Australians is Denisovan DNA. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  these  results  are  valid  –  and  it’s  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  further research is under way and may either reinforce or modify these conclusions – the Interbreeders  got  at  least  some  things  right.  But  that  doesn’t  mean  that  the Replacement  Theory  is  completely  wrong.  Since  Neanderthals  and  Denisovans contributed  only  a  small  amount  of  DNA  to  our  present-day  genome,  it  is impossible  to  speak  of  a  ‘merger’  between  Sapiens  and  other  human  species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although di erences between them were not large enough to completely prevent fertile intercourse, they were sufficient to make such contacts very rare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  then  should  we  understand  the  biological  relatedness  of  Sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans? Clearly, they were not completely di erent species like  horses  and  donkeys.  On  the  other  hand,  they  were  not  just  di erent populations  of  the  same  species,  like  bulldogs  and  spaniels.  Biological  reality  is not black and white. There are also important grey areas. Every two species that evolved from a common ancestor, such as horses and donkeys, were at one time just two populations of the same species, like bulldogs and spaniels. There must have  been  a  point  when  the  two  populations  were  already  quite  di erent  from one  another,  but  still  capable  on  rare  occasions  of  having  sex  and  producing fertile o spring. Then another mutation severed this last connecting thread, and they went their separate evolutionary ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seems  that  about  50,000  years  ago,  Sapiens,  Neanderthals  and  Denisovans were at that borderline point. They were almost, but not quite, entirely separate species. As we shall see in the next chapter, Sapiens were already very di erent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a><img src="index-21_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Neanderthals  and  Denisovans  not  only  in  their  genetic  code  and  physical traits, but also in their cognitive and social abilities, yet it appears it was still just possible, on rare occasions, for a Sapiens and a Neanderthal to produce a fertile o spring. So the populations did not merge, but a few lucky Neanderthal genes did hitch a ride on the Sapiens Express. It is unsettling – and perhaps thrilling – to think that we Sapiens could at one time have sex with an animal from a di erent species, and produce children together. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">3. </b></a><b class="calibre3">A speculative reconstruction of a Neanderthal child. Genetic evidence hints that at least some</b> <b class="calibre3">Neanderthals may have had fair skin and hair</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if the Neanderthals, Denisovans and other human species didn’t merge with Sapiens, why did they vanish? One possibility is that  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> drove them to extinction. Imagine a Sapiens band reaching a Balkan valley where Neanderthals had lived for hundreds of thousands of years. The newcomers began to hunt the deer  and  gather  the  nuts  and  berries  that  were  the  Neanderthals’  traditional staples.  Sapiens  were  more  pro cient  hunters  and  gatherers  –  thanks  to  better technology  and  superior  social  skills  –  so  they  multiplied  and  spread.  The  less resourceful  Neanderthals  found  it  increasingly  di cult  to  feed  themselves.  Their population  dwindled  and  they  slowly  died  out,  except  perhaps  for  one  or  two members who joined their Sapiens neighbours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another possibility is that competition for resources  ared up into violence and genocide.  Tolerance  is  not  a  Sapiens  trademark.  In  modern  times,  a  small di erence in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. Would ancient Sapiens have been more tolerant towards an entirely di erent human species? It may well be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>that  when  Sapiens  encountered  Neanderthals,  the  result  was  the  rst  and  most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whichever  way  it  happened,  the  Neanderthals  (and  the  other  human  species) pose one of history’s great what ifs. Imagine how things might have turned out had the Neanderthals or Denisovans survived alongside  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. What kind of cultures, societies and political structures would have emerged in a world where several  di erent  human  species  coexisted?  How,  for  example,  would  religious faiths have unfolded? Would the book of Genesis have declared that Neanderthals descend from Adam and Eve, would Jesus have died for the sins of the Denisovans, and  would  the  Qur’an  have  reserved  seats  in  heaven  for  all  righteous  humans, whatever their species? Would Neanderthals have been able to serve in the Roman legions, or in the sprawling bureaucracy of imperial China? Would the American Declaration of Independence hold as a self-evident truth that all members of the genus  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> are created equal? Would Karl Marx have urged workers of all species to unite? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the past 10,000 years,  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> has grown so accustomed to being the only human species that it’s hard for us to conceive of any other possibility. Our lack of brothers and sisters makes it easier to imagine that we are the epitome of creation,  and  that  a  chasm  separates  us  from  the  rest  of  the  animal  kingdom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Charles  Darwin  indicated  that  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  was  just  another  kind  of animal,  people  were  outraged.  Even  today  many  refuse  to  believe  it.  Had  the Neanderthals survived, would we still imagine ourselves to be a creature apart? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps this is exactly why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals. They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether  Sapiens  are  to  blame  or  not,  no  sooner  had  they  arrived  at  a  new location  than  the  native  population  became  extinct.  The  last  remains  of  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">soloensis</i> are dated to about 50,000 years ago.  <i class="calibre4">Homo denisova</i> disappeared shortly thereafter. Neanderthals made their exit roughly 30,000 years ago. The last dwarf-like humans vanished from Flores Island about 12,000 years ago. They left behind some  bones,  stone  tools,  a  few  genes  in  our  DNA  and  a  lot  of  unanswered questions. They also left behind us,  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>, the last human species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  was  the  Sapiens’  secret  of  success?  How  did  we  manage  to  settle  so rapidly in so many distant and ecologically di erent habitats? How did we push all other human species into oblivion? Why couldn’t even the strong, brainy, cold-proof Neanderthals survive our onslaught? The debate continues to rage. The most likely  answer  is  the  very  thing  that  makes  the  debate  possible:  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i> conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a><b class="calibre3">2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Tree of Knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre1">IN  THE  PREVIOUS  CHAPTER  WE  SAW  THAT  although  Sapiens  had  already</p>
<p class="calibre1">populated East Africa 150,000 years ago, they began to overrun the rest of planet Earth  and  drive  the  other  human  species  to  extinction  only  about  70,000  years ago. In the intervening millennia, even though these archaic Sapiens looked just like  us  and  their  brains  were  as  big  as  ours,  they  did  not  enjoy  any  marked advantage  over  other  human  species,  did  not  produce  particularly  sophisticated tools, and did not accomplish any other special feats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, in the  rst recorded encounter between Sapiens and Neanderthals, the Neanderthals won. About 100,000 years ago, some Sapiens groups migrated north to the Levant, which was Neanderthal territory, but failed to secure a  rm footing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It might have been due to nasty natives, an inclement climate, or unfamiliar local parasites.  Whatever  the  reason,  the  Sapiens  eventually  retreated,  leaving  the Neanderthals as masters of the Middle East. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This poor record of achievement has led scholars to speculate that the internal structure  of  the  brains  of  these  Sapiens  was  probably  di erent  from  ours.  They looked  like  us,  but  their  cognitive  abilities  –  learning,  remembering, communicating  –  were  far  more  limited.  Teaching  such  an  ancient  Sapiens English,  persuading  him  of  the  truth  of  Christian  dogma,  or  getting  him  to understand  the  theory  of  evolution  would  probably  have  been  hopeless undertakings.  Conversely,  we  would  have  had  a  very  hard  time  learning  his language and understanding his way of thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  then,  beginning  about  70,000  years  ago,  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  started doing  very special things. Around that date Sapiens bands left Africa for a second time. This time they drove the Neanderthals and all other human species not only from the Middle  East,  but  from  the  face  of  the  earth.  Within  a  remarkably  short  period, Sapiens  reached  Europe  and  East  Asia.  About  45,000  years  ago,  they  somehow crossed the open sea and landed in Australia – a continent hitherto untouched by humans.  The  period  from  about  70,000  years  ago  to  about  30,000  years  ago witnessed  the  invention  of  boats,  oil  lamps,  bows  and  arrows  and  needles (essential for sewing warm clothing). The  rst objects that can reliably be called art date from this era (see the Stadel lion-man on <a href="#p25">this page)</a>, as does the  rst clear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>evidence for religion, commerce and social stratification. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  researchers  believe  that  these  unprecedented  accomplishments  were  the product  of  a  revolution  in  Sapiens’  cognitive  abilities.  They  maintain  that  the people who drove the Neanderthals to extinction, settled Australia, and carved the Stadel lion-man were as intelligent, creative and sensitive as we are. If we were to come across the artists of the Stadel Cave, we could learn their language and they ours. We’d be able to explain to them everything we know – from the adventures of  Alice  in  Wonderland  to  the  paradoxes  of  quantum  physics  –  and  they  could teach us how their people view the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not  sure.  The  most  commonly  believed  theory  argues  that  accidental  genetic mutations  changed  the  inner  wiring  of  the  brains  of  Sapiens,  enabling  them  to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell. But it’s more important to understand the consequences of the Tree of Knowledge mutation than its causes. What was so special about the new Sapiens language that it enabled us to conquer the world? <a href="#p39">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  not  the  rst  language.  Every  animal  has  some  kind  of  language.  Even insects, such as bees and ants, know how to communicate in sophisticated ways, informing one another of the whereabouts of food. Neither was it the  rst vocal language.  Many  animals,  including  all  ape  and  monkey  species,  have  vocal languages.  For  example,  green  monkeys  use  calls  of  various  kinds  to communicate. Zoologists have identi ed one call that means, ‘Careful! An eagle!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  slightly  di erent  call  warns,  ‘Careful!  A  lion!’  When  researchers  played  a recording of the  rst call to a group of monkeys, the monkeys stopped what they were doing and looked upwards in fear. When the same group heard a recording of the second call, the lion warning, they quickly scrambled up a tree. Sapiens can produce  many  more  distinct  sounds  than  green  monkeys,  but  whales  and elephants  have  equally  impressive  abilities.  A  parrot  can  say  anything  Albert Einstein  could  say,  as  well  as  mimicking  the  sounds  of  phones  ringing,  doors slamming and sirens wailing. Whatever advantage Einstein had over a parrot, it wasn’t vocal. What, then, is so special about our language? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  most  common  answer  is  that  our  language  is  amazingly  supple.  We  can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an in nite number of sentences,  each  with  a  distinct  meaning.  We  can  thereby  ingest,  store  and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A green monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell  her  friends  that  this  morning,  near  the  bend  in  the  river,  she  saw  a  lion</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a><img src="index-25_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the di erent  paths  leading  to  the  area.  With  this  information,  the  members  of  her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means of sharing information about the world. But the most important information that needed to be conveyed was about humans, not about lions and bison. Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According to this theory  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> is primarily a social animal.  Social  cooperation  is  our  key  for  survival  and  reproduction.  It  is  not enough  for  individual  men  and  women  to  know  the  whereabouts  of  lions  and bison. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">4. </b></a><b class="calibre3">An ivory figurine of a ‘lion-man’ (or ‘lioness-woman’) from the Stadel Cave in Germany ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.32,000 years</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a><b class="calibre3">ago). The body is human, but the head is leonine. This is one of the first indisputable examples of art, and</b> <b class="calibre3">probably of religion, and of the ability of the human mind to imagine things that do not really exist</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The amount of information that one must obtain and store in order to track the ever-changing relationships of a few dozen individuals is staggering. (In a band of fty  individuals,  there  are  1,225  one-on-one  relationships,  and  countless  more complex  social  combinations.)  All  apes  show  a  keen  interest  in  such  social information, but they have trouble gossiping e ectively. Neanderthals and archaic <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> probably also had a hard time talking behind each other’s backs – a much maligned ability which is in fact essential for cooperation in large numbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  linguistic  skills  that  modern  Sapiens  acquired  about  seventy  millennia ago  enabled them  to  gossip  for  hours  on  end.  Reliable  information  about  who could  be  trusted  meant  that  small  bands  could  expand  into  larger  bands,  and Sapiens could develop tighter and more sophisticated types of cooperation<a href="index_split_005.html#p353">.1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies support it. Even today the vast majority of human communication – whether in the form of emails, phone calls or newspaper columns – is gossip. It comes so naturally to us that it seems as if our language evolved for this very purpose. Do you think that history professors chat about the reasons for World War One when they meet for lunch, or that nuclear physicists spend their co ee breaks at scienti c conferences talking about  quarks?  Sometimes.  But  more  often,  they  gossip  about  the  professor  who caught her husband cheating, or the quarrel between the head of the department and  the  dean,  or  the  rumours  that  a  colleague  used  his  research  funds  to  buy  a Lexus. Gossip usually focuses on wrongdoings. Rumour-mongers are the original fourth estate, journalists who inform society about and thus protect it from cheats and freeloaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most likely, both the gossip theory and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  Yet  the  truly  unique  feature  of  our  language  is  not  its  ability  to  transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about  things  that  do  not  exist  at  all.  As  far  as  we  know,  only  Sapiens  can  talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Legends,  myths,  gods  and  religions  appeared  for  the  rst  time  with  the Cognitive  Revolution.  Many  animals  and  human  species  could  previously  say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Careful! A lion!’ Thanks to the Cognitive Revolution,  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> acquired the ability to say, ‘The lion is the guardian spirit of our tribe.’ This ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s relatively easy to agree that only  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> can speak about things that don’t  really  exist,  and  believe  six  impossible  things  before  breakfast.  You  could never  convince  a  monkey  to  give  you  a  banana  by  promising  him  limitless</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>bananas after death in monkey heaven. But why is it important? After all,  ction can be dangerously misleading or distracting. People who go to the forest looking for  fairies and unicorns would seem to have less chance of survival than people who go looking for mushrooms and deer. And if you spend hours praying to non-existing  guardian  spirits,  aren’t  you  wasting  precious  time,  time  better  spent foraging, fighting and fornicating? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  ction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so  <i class="calibre4">col ectively</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation story, the Dreamtime myths of Aboriginal Australians, and the nationalist myths of modern states. Such myths  give  Sapiens  the  unprecedented  ability  to  cooperate  exibly  in  large numbers. Ants and bees can also work together in huge numbers, but they do so in a  very  rigid  manner  and  only  with  close  relatives.  Wolves  and  chimpanzees cooperate far more  exibly than ants, but they can do so only with small numbers of  other  individuals  that  they  know  intimately.  Sapiens  can  cooperate  in extremely  exible ways with countless numbers of strangers. That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Legend of Peugeot</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our chimpanzee cousins usually live in small troops of several dozen individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They form close friendships, hunt together and  ght shoulder to shoulder against baboons,  cheetahs  and  enemy  chimpanzees.  Their  social  structure  tends  to  be hierarchical. The dominant member, who is almost always a male, is termed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘alpha male’. Other males and females exhibit their submission to the alpha male by bowing before him while making grunting sounds, not unlike human subjects kowtowing  before  a  king.  The  alpha  male  strives  to  maintain  social  harmony within  his  troop.  When  two  individuals  ght,  he  will  intervene  and  stop  the violence. Less benevolently, he might monopolise particularly coveted foods and prevent lower-ranking males from mating with the females. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  two  males  are  contesting  the  alpha  position,  they  usually  do  so  by forming extensive coalitions of supporters, both male and female, from within the group.  Ties  between  coalition  members  are  based  on  intimate  daily  contact  –</p>
<p class="calibre1">hugging,  touching,  kissing,  grooming  and  mutual  favours.  Just  as  human politicians on election campaigns go around shaking hands and kissing babies, so aspirants  to  the  top  position  in  a  chimpanzee  group  spend  much  time  hugging, back-slapping and kissing baby chimps. The alpha male usually wins his position not  because  he  is  physically  stronger,  but  because  he  leads  a  large  and  stable</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>coalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt struggles for the alpha position, but in almost all day-to-day activities. Members of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help one another in times of trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are clear limits to the size of groups that can be formed and maintained in such a way. In order to function, all members of a group must know each other intimately.  Two  chimpanzees  who  have  never  met,  never  fought,  and  never engaged in mutual grooming will not know whether they can trust one another, whether  it  would  be  worthwhile  to  help  one  another,  and  which  of  them  ranks higher.  Under  natural  conditions,  a  typical  chimpanzee  troop  consists  of  about twenty to  fty individuals. As the number of chimpanzees in a troop increases, the social order destabilises, eventually leading to a rupture and the formation of a new  troop  by  some  of  the  animals.  Only  in  a  handful  of  cases  have  zoologists observed  groups  larger  than  a  hundred.  Separate  groups  seldom  cooperate,  and tend to compete for territory and food. Researchers have documented prolonged warfare between groups, and even one case of ‘genocidal’ activity in which one troop systematically slaughtered most members of a neighbouring band. <a href="index_split_005.html#p353">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Similar patterns probably dominated the social lives of early humans, including archaic  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. Humans, like chimps, have social instincts that enabled our ancestors  to  form  friendships  and  hierarchies,  and  to  hunt  or  ght  together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, like the social instincts of chimps, those of humans were adapted only for  small  intimate  groups.  When  the  group  grew  too  large,  its  social  order destabilised and the band split. Even if a particularly fertile valley could feed 500</p>
<p class="calibre1">archaic  Sapiens,  there  was  no  way  that  so  many  strangers  could  live  together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  could  they  agree  who  should  be  leader,  who  should  hunt  where,  or  who should mate with whom? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  wake  of  the  Cognitive  Revolution,  gossip  helped  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  to  form larger and more stable bands. But even gossip has its limits. Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip e ectively about, more than 150 human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls somewhere around this magic number. Below this threshold, communities, businesses, social networks and  military  units  can  maintain  themselves  based  mainly  on  intimate acquaintance and rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles and law  books  to  keep  order. <a href="index_split_005.html#p353">3</a>  A  platoon  of  thirty  soldiers  or  even  a  company  of  a hundred  soldiers  can  function  well  on  the  basis  of  intimate  relations,  with  a minimum of formal discipline. A well-respected sergeant can become ‘king of the company and exercise authority even over commissioned o cers. A small family business  can  survive  and  ourish  without  a  board  of  directors,  a  CEO  or  an accounting department. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  did  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  manage  to  cross  this  critical  threshold,  eventually founding  cities  comprising  tens  of  thousands  of  inhabitants  and  empires  ruling hundreds  of  millions?  The  secret  was  probably  the  appearance  of  ction.  Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any  large-scale  human  cooperation  –  whether  a  modern  state,  a  medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination. Churches are rooted in common religious myths.  Two  Catholics  who  have  never  met  can  nevertheless  go  together  on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in human  esh and allowed Himself to be cruci ed to redeem our sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">States  are  rooted  in  common  national  myths.  Two  Serbs  who  have  never  met might risk their lives to save one another because both believe in the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the Serbian  ag. Judicial systems are  rooted  in  common  legal  myths.  Two  lawyers  who  have  never  met  can nevertheless  combine  e orts  to  defend  a  complete  stranger  because  they both believe in the existence of laws, justice, human rights – and the money paid out in fees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell one another.  There  are  no  gods  in  the  universe,  no  nations,  no  money,  no  human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People easily understand that ‘primitives’ cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the camp re. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly  the  same  basis.  Take  for  example  the  world  of  business  corporations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern  business-people  and  lawyers  are,  in  fact,  powerful  sorcerers.  The principal di erence between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales. The legend of Peugeot affords us a good example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  icon  that  somewhat  resembles  the  Stadel  lion-man  appears  today  on  cars, trucks and motorcycles from Paris to Sydney. It’s the hood ornament that adorns vehicles  made  by  Peugeot,  one  of  the  oldest  and  largest  of  Europe’s  carmakers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peugeot began as a small family business in the village of Valentigney, just 300</p>
<p class="calibre1">kilometres  from  the  Stadel  Cave.  Today  the  company  employs  about  200,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  worldwide,  most  of  whom  are  complete  strangers  to  each  other.  These strangers cooperate so e ectively that in 2008 Peugeot produced more than 1.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">million automobiles, earning revenues of about 55 billion euros. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a><img src="index-30_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">In what sense can we say that Peugeot SA (the company’s o cial name) exists? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are many Peugeot vehicles, but these are obviously not the company. Even if  every  Peugeot  in  the  world  were  simultaneously  junked  and  sold  for  scrap metal,  Peugeot  SA  would  not  disappear.  It  would  continue  to  manufacture  new cars  and  issue  its  annual  report.  The  company  owns  factories,  machinery  and showrooms,  and  employs  mechanics,  accountants  and  secretaries,  but  all  these together  do  not  comprise  Peugeot.  A  disaster  might  kill  every  single  one  of Peugeot’s employees, and go on to destroy all of its assembly lines and executive o ces. Even then, the company could borrow money, hire new employees, build new factories and buy new machinery. Peugeot has managers and shareholders, but neither do they constitute the company. All the managers could be dismissed and all its shares sold, but the company itself would remain intact. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">5. </b></a><b class="calibre3">The Peugeot Lion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It doesn’t mean that Peugeot SA is invulnerable or immortal. If a judge were to mandate the dissolution of the company, its factories would remain standing and its workers, accountants, managers and shareholders would continue to live – but Peugeot  SA  would  immediately  vanish.  In  short,  Peugeot  SA  seems  to  have  no essential connection to the physical world. Does it really exist? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peugeot  is  a  gment  of  our  collective  imagination.  Lawyers  call  this  a  ‘legal ction’. It can’t be pointed at; it is not a physical object. But it exists as a legal entity.  Just  like  you  or  me,  it  is  bound  by  the  laws  of  the  countries  in  which  it operates. It can open a bank account and own property. It pays taxes, and it can be sued and even prosecuted separately from any of the people who own or work for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peugeot  belongs  to  a  particular  genre  of  legal  ctions  called  ‘limited  liability companies’. The idea behind such companies is among humanity’s most ingenious inventions.  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> lived for untold millennia without them. During most of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>recorded  history  property  could  be  owned  only  by  esh-and-blood  humans,  the kind  that  stood  on  two  legs  and  had  big  brains.  If  in  thirteenth-century  France Jean set up a wagon-manufacturing workshop, he himself was the business. If a wagon he’d made broke down a week after purchase, the disgruntled buyer would have sued Jean personally. If Jean had borrowed 1,000 gold coins to set up his workshop and the business failed, he would have had to repay the loan by selling his private property – his house, his cow, his land. He might even have had to sell his  children into  servitude.  If  he  couldn’t  cover  the  debt,  he  could  be  thrown  in prison by the state or enslaved by his creditors. He was fully liable, without limit, for all obligations incurred by his workshop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you had lived back then, you would probably have thought twice before you opened  an  enterprise  of  your  own.  And  indeed  this  legal  situation  discouraged entrepreneurship. People were afraid to start new businesses and take economic risks. It hardly seemed worth taking the chance that their families could end up utterly destitute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  why  people  began  collectively  to  imagine  the  existence  of  limited liability companies. Such companies were legally independent of the people who set  them  up,  or  invested  money  in  them,  or  managed  them.  Over  the  last  few centuries such companies have become the main players in the economic arena, and  we  have  grown  so  used  to  them  that  we  forget  they  exist  only  in  our imagination.  In  the  US,  the  technical  term  for  a  limited  liability  company  is  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘corporation’,  which  is  ironic,  because  the  term  derives  from  ‘ <i class="calibre4">corpus</i>’  (‘body’  in Latin) – the one thing these corporations lack. Despite their having no real bodies, the  American  legal  system  treats  corporations  as  legal  persons,  as  if  they  were flesh-and-blood human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so did the French legal system back in 1896, when Armand Peugeot, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had inherited from his parents a metalworking shop that produced springs, saws and bicycles, decided to go into the automobile business. To that end, he set up a limited  liability  company.  He  named  the  company  after  himself,  but  it  was independent of him. If one of the cars broke down, the buyer could sue Peugeot, but  not  Armand  Peugeot.  If  the  company  borrowed  millions  of  francs  and  then went bust, Armand Peugeot did not owe its creditors a single franc. The loan, after all, had been given to Peugeot, the company, not to Armand Peugeot, the  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i>.  Armand  Peugeot  died  in  1915.  Peugeot,  the  company,  is  still  alive  and well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  exactly  did  Armand  Peugeot,  the  man,  create  Peugeot,  the  company?  In much  the  same  way  that  priests  and  sorcerers  have  created  gods  and  demons throughout  history,  and  in  which  thousands  of  French  <i class="calibre4">curés</i>  were  still  creating Christ’s body every Sunday in the parish churches. It all revolved around telling stories, and convincing people to believe them. In the case of the French  <i class="calibre4">curés</i>, the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>crucial  story  was  that  of  Christ’s  life  and  death  as  told  by  the  Catholic  Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to this story, if a Catholic priest dressed in his sacred garments solemnly said the right words at the right moment, mundane bread and wine turned into God’s  esh and blood. The priest exclaimed ‘ <i class="calibre4">Hoc est corpus meum! </i>’ (Latin for ‘This is my body!’) and hocus pocus – the bread turned into Christ’s  esh. Seeing that the  priest  had  properly  and  assiduously  observed  all  the  procedures,  millions  of devout French Catholics behaved as if God really existed in the consecrated bread and wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the case of Peugeot SA the crucial story was the French legal code, as written by the French parliament. According to the French legislators, if a certi ed lawyer followed all the proper liturgy and rituals, wrote all the required spells and oaths on a wonderfully decorated piece of paper, and a xed his ornate signature to the bottom of the document, then hocus pocus – a new company was incorporated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When in 1896 Armand Peugeot wanted to create his company, he paid a lawyer to go  through  all  these  sacred  procedures.  Once  the  lawyer  had  performed  all  the right rituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths, millions of upright French citizens behaved as if the Peugeot company really existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Telling e ective stories is not easy. The di culty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about  gods,  or  nations,  or  limited  liability  companies?  Yet  when  it  succeeds,  it gives  Sapiens  immense  power,  because  it  enables  millions  of  strangers  to cooperate and work towards common goals. Just try to imagine how di cult it would have been to create states, or churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  the  years,  people  have  woven  an  incredibly  complex  network  of  stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within this network,  ctions such as Peugeot not only exist, but also accumulate immense power. The kinds of things that people create through this network of stories are known in academic circles as ‘ ctions’, ‘social constructs’, or ‘imagined realities’. An imagined reality is not a lie. I lie when I say that there is a lion near the river when I know perfectly well that there is no lion there. There is nothing special about lies. Green monkeys and chimpanzees can lie. A green monkey, for example,  has  been  observed  calling  ‘Careful!  A  lion!’  when  there  was  no  lion around. This alarm conveniently frightened away a fellow monkey who had just found a banana, leaving the liar all alone to steal the prize for itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long  as  this  communal  belief  persists,  the  imagined  reality  exerts  force  in  the world.  The  sculptor  from  the  Stadel  Cave  may  sincerely  have  believed  in  the existence of the lion-man guardian spirit. Some sorcerers are charlatans, but most</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>sincerely believe in the existence of gods and demons. Most millionaires sincerely believe  in  the  existence  of  money  and  limited  liability  companies.  Most  human-rights  activists  sincerely  believe  in  the  existence  of  human  rights.  No  one  was lying when, in 2011, the UN demanded that the Libyan government respect the human rights of its citizens, even though the UN, Libya and human rights are all figments of our fertile imaginations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever  since  the  Cognitive  Revolution,  Sapiens  has  thus  been  living  in  a  dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by,  the  imagined  reality  became  ever  more  powerful,  so  that  today  the  very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bypassing the Genome</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ability to create an imagined reality out of words enabled large numbers of strangers  to  cooperate  e ectively.  But  it  also  did  something  more.  Since  large-scale  human  cooperation  is  based  on  myths,  the  way  people  cooperate  can  be altered  by  changing  the  myths  –  by  telling  di erent  stories.  Under  the  right circumstances myths can change rapidly. In 1789 the French population switched almost  overnight  from  believing  in  the  myth  of  the  divine  right  of  kings  to believing  in  the  myth  of  the  sovereignty  of  the  people.  Consequently,ever  since the  Cognitive  Revolution  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  has  been  able  to  revise  its  behaviour rapidly  in  accordance  with  changing  needs.  This  opened  a  fast  lane  of  cultural evolution, bypassing the tra c jams of genetic evolution. Speeding down this fast lane,  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> soon far outstripped all other human and animal species in its ability to cooperate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The behaviour of other social animals is determined to a large extent by their genes.  DNA  is  not  an  autocrat.  Animal  behaviour  is  also  in uenced  by environmental  factors  and  individual  quirks.  Nevertheless,  in  a  given environment, animals of the same species will tend to behave in a similar way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signi cant changes in social behaviour cannot occur, in general, without genetic mutations. For example, common chimpanzees have a genetic tendency to live in hierarchical  groups  headed  by  an  alpha  male.  Members  of  a  closely  related chimpanzee species, bonobos, usually live in more egalitarian groups dominated by female alliances. Female common chimpanzees cannot take lessons from their bonobo relatives and stage a feminist revolution. Male chimps cannot gather in a constitutional assembly to abolish the o ce of alpha male and declare that from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>here  on  out  all  chimps  are  to  be  treated  as  equals.  Such  dramatic  changes  in behaviour would occur only if something changed in the chimpanzees’ DNA. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For similar reasons, archaic humans did not initiate any revolutions. As far as we can tell, changes in social patterns, the invention of new technologies and the settlement  of  alien  habitats  resulted  from  genetic  mutations  and  environmental pressures more than from cultural initiatives. This is why it took humans hundreds of  thousands  of  years  to  make  these  steps.  Two  million  years  ago,  genetic mutations resulted in the appearance of a new human species called  <i class="calibre4">Homo erectus</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its  emergence  was  accompanied  by  the  development  of  a  new  stone  tool technology, now recognised as a de ning feature of this species. As long as  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">erectus</i>  did  not  undergo  further  genetic  alterations,  its  stone  tools  remained roughly the same – for close to 2 million years! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  contrast,  ever  since  the  Cognitive  Revolution,  Sapiens  have  been  able  to change their behaviour quickly, transmitting new behaviours to future generations without  any  need  of  genetic  or environmental  change.  As  a  prime  example, consider  the  repeated  appearance  of  childless  elites,  such  as  the  Catholic priesthood,  Buddhist  monastic  orders  and  Chinese  eunuch  bureaucracies.  The existence  of  such  elites  goes  against  the  most  fundamental  principles  of  natural selection, since these dominant members of society willingly give up procreation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas  chimpanzee  alpha  males  use  their  power  to  have  sex  with  as  many females  as  possible  –  and  consequently  sire  a  large  proportion  of  their  troop’s young – the Catholic alpha male abstains completely from sexual intercourse and childcare.  This  abstinence  does  not  result  from  unique  environmental  conditions such as a severe lack of food or want of potential mates. Nor is it the result of some quirky genetic mutation. The Catholic Church has survived for centuries, not by passing on a ‘celibacy gene’ from one pope to the next, but by passing on the stories of the New Testament and of Catholic canon law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained  xed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature  of  their  interpersonal  relations,  their  economic  activities  and  a  host  of other  behaviours  within  a  decade  or  two.  Consider  a  resident  of  Berlin,  born  in 1900  and  living  to  the  ripe  age  of  one  hundred.  She  spent  her  childhood  in  the Hohenzollern Empire of Wilhelm II; her adult years in the Weimar Republic, the Nazi  Third  Reich  and  Communist  East  Germany;  and  she  died  a  citizen  of  a democratic  and  reuni ed  Germany.  She  had  managed  to  be  a  part  of  ve  very different sociopolitical systems, though her DNA remained exactly the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  the  key  to  Sapiens’  success.  In  a  one-on-one  brawl,  a  Neanderthal would probably have beaten a Sapiens. But in a conflict of hundreds, Neanderthals wouldn’t  stand  a  chance.  Neanderthals  could  share  information  about  the whereabouts of lions, but they probably could not tell – and revise – stories about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a><img src="index-35_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">tribal spirits. Without an ability to compose  ction, Neanderthals were unable to cooperate effectively in large numbers, nor could they adapt their social behaviour to rapidly changing challenges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While we can’t get inside a Neanderthal mind to understand how they thought, we  have  indirect  evidence  of  the  limits  to  their  cognition  compared  with  their Sapiens  rivals.  Archaeologists  excavating  30,000-year-old  Sapiens  sites  in  the European heartland occasionally  nd there seashells from the Mediterranean and Atlantic  coasts.  In  all  likelihood,  these  shells  got  to  the  continental  interior through  long-distance  trade  between  di erent  Sapiens  bands.  Neanderthal  sites lack any evidence of such trade. Each group manufactured its own tools from local materials. <a href="index_split_005.html#p353">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">6. </b></a><b class="calibre3">The Catholic alpha male abstains from sexual intercourse and childcare, even though there is no</b> <b class="calibre3">genetic or ecological reason for him to do so</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another example comes from the South Paci c. Sapiens bands that lived on the island of New Ireland, north of New Guinea, used a volcanic glass called obsidian to manufacture particularly strong and sharp tools. New Ireland, however, has no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>natural deposits of obsidian. Laboratory tests revealed that the obsidian they used was brought from deposits on New Britain, an island 400 kilometres away. Some of the inhabitants of these islands must have been skilled navigators who traded from island to island over long distances. <a href="index_split_005.html#p353">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Trade may seem a very pragmatic activity, one that needs no  ctive basis. Yet the fact is that no animal other than Sapiens engages in trade, and all the Sapiens trade  neworks  about  which  we  have  detailed  evidence  were  based  on  ctions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trade  cannot  exist  without  trust,  and  it  is  very  di cult  to  trust  strangers.  The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such  ctional entities as the dollar,  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank,  and  the  totemic  trademarks  of  corporations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If archaic Sapiens believing in such  ctions traded shells and obsidian, it stands to  reason  that  they  could  also  have  traded  information,  thus  creating  a  much denser and wider knowledge network than the one that served Neanderthals and other archaic humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hunting  techniques  provide  another  illustration  of  these  di erences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neanderthals usually hunted alone or in small groups. Sapiens, on the other hand, developed  techniques  that  relied  on  cooperation  between  many  dozens  of individuals, and perhaps even between di erent bands. One particularly e ective method was to surround an entire herd of animals, such as wild horses, then chase them into a narrow gorge, where it was easy to slaughter them en masse. If all went  according  to  plan,  the  bands  could  harvest  tons  of  meat,  fat  and  animal skins in a single afternoon of collective e ort, and either consume these riches in a giant potlatch, or dry, smoke or (in Arctic areas) freeze them for later usage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Archaeologists have discovered sites where entire herds were butchered annually in  such  ways.  There  are  even  sites  where  fences  and  obstacles  were  erected  in order to create artificial traps and slaughtering grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  may  presume  that  Neanderthals  were  not  pleased  to  see  their  traditional hunting  grounds  turned  into  Sapiens-controlled  slaughterhouses.  However,  if violence broke out between the two species, Neanderthals were not much better o   than  wild  horses.  Fifty  Neanderthals  cooperating  in  traditional  and  static patterns were no match for 500 versatile and innovative Sapiens. And even if the Sapiens lost the  rst round, they could quickly invent new stratagems that would enable them to win the next time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">b. Rapid innovation of social</p>
<p class="calibre1">rights</p>
<p class="calibre1">behaviour</p>
<p class="calibre1">History and Biology</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  immense  diversity  of  imagined  realities  that  Sapiens  invented,  and  the resulting  diversity  of  behaviour  patterns,  are  the  main  components  of  what  we call ‘cultures’. Once cultures appeared, they never ceased to change and develop, and these unstoppable alterations are what we call ‘history’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Cognitive  Revolution  is  accordingly  the  point  when  history  declared  its independence  from  biology.  Until  the  Cognitive  Revolution,  the  doings  of  all human species belonged to the realm of biology, or, if you so prefer, prehistory (I tend to avoid the term ‘prehistory’, because it wrongly implies that even before the  Cognitive  Revolution,  humans  were  in  a  category  of  their  own).  From  the Cognitive Revolution onwards, historical narratives replace biological theories as our primary means of explaining the development of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. To understand the rise of Christianity or the French Revolution, it is not enough to comprehend the  interaction  of  genes,  hormones  and  organisms.  It  is  necessary  to  take  into account the interaction of ideas, images and fantasies as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This does not mean that  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> and human culture became exempt from biological laws. We are still animals, and our physical, emotional and cognitive abilities are still shaped by our DNA. Our societies are built from the same building blocks  as  Neanderthal  or  chimpanzee  societies,  and  the  more  we  examine  these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>building  blocks  –  sensations,  emotions,  family  ties  –  the  less  di erence  we  nd between us and other apes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is, however, a mistake to look for the di erences at the level of the individual or  the  family.  One  on  one,  even  ten  on  ten,  we  are  embarrassingly  similar  to chimpanzees.  Signi cant  di erences  begin  to  appear  only  when  we  cross  the threshold  of  150  individuals,  and  when  we  reach  1,000–2,000  individuals,  the di erences  are  astounding.  If  you  tried  to  bunch  together  thousands  of chimpanzees into Tiananmen Square, Wall Street, the Vatican or the headquarters of  the  United  Nations,  the  result  would  be  pandemonium.  By  contrast,  Sapiens regularly  gather  by  the  thousands  in  such  places.  Together,  they  create  orderly patterns  –  such  as  trade  networks,  mass  celebrations  and  political  institutions  –</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  could  never  have  created  in  isolation.  The  real  di erence  between  us and  chimpanzees  is  the  mythical  glue  that  binds  together  large  numbers  of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, we also needed other skills, such as the ability to make and use tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  tool-making  is  of  little  consequence  unless  it  is  coupled  with  the  ability  to cooperate with many others. How is it that we now have intercontinental missiles with  nuclear  warheads,  whereas  30,000  years  ago  we  had  only  sticks  with  int spearheads?  Physiologically,  there  has  been  no  signi cant  improvement  in  our tool-making  capacity  over  the  last  30,000  years.  Albert  Einstein  was  far  less dexterous  with  his  hands  than  was  an  ancient  hunter-gatherer.  However,  our capacity to cooperate with large numbers of strangers has improved dramatically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ancient  int spearhead was manufactured in minutes by a single person, who relied  on  the  advice  and help  of  a  few  intimate  friends.  The  production  of  a modern nuclear warhead requires the cooperation of millions of strangers all over the world – from the workers who mine the uranium ore in the depths of the earth to  theoretical  physicists  who  write  long  mathematical  formulas  to  describe  the interactions of subatomic particles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  summarise  the  relationship  between  biology  and  history  after  the  Cognitive Revolution:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">a</b>.  Biology  sets  the  basic  parameters  for  the  behaviour  and  capacities  of  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i>.  The  whole  of  history  takes  place  within  the  bounds  of  this  biological arena. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">b</b>.  However,  this  arena  is  extraordinarily  large,  allowing  Sapiens  to  play  an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent  ction, Sapiens create  more  and  more  complex  games,  which  each  generation  develops  and elaborates even further. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a><b class="calibre3">c</b>. Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions. Referring only to our biological constraints would  be  like  a  radio  sports-caster  who,  attending  the  World  Cup  football championships,  o ers  his  listeners  a  detailed  description  of  the  playing  eld rather than an account of what the players are doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What games did our Stone Age ancestors play in the arena of history? As far as we know, the people who carved the Stadel lion-man some 30,000 years ago had the same  physical,  emotional  and  intellectual  abilities  we  have.  What  did  they  do when they woke up in the morning? What did they eat for breakfast – and lunch? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  were  their  societies  like?  Did  they  have  monogamous  relationships  and nuclear  families?  Did  they  have  ceremonies,  moral  codes,  sports  contests  and religious rituals? Did they  ght wars? The next chapter takes a peek behind the curtain of the ages, examining what life was like in the millennia separating the Cognitive Revolution from the Agricultural Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p24">* </a>Here and in the fol owing pages, when speaking about Sapiens language, I refer to the basic linguistic abilities of our  species  and  not  to  a  particular  dialect.  English,  Hindi  and  Chinese  are  al   variants  of  Sapiens  language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, even at the time of the Cognitive Revolution, different Sapiens groups had different dialects. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A Day in the Life of Adam and Eve</p>
<p class="calibre1">TO UNDERSTAND OUR NATURE, HISTORY and psychology, we must get inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  heads  of  our  hunter-gatherer  ancestors.  For  nearly  the  entire  history  of  our species,  Sapiens  lived  as  foragers.  The  past  200  years,  during  which  ever increasing numbers of Sapiens have obtained their daily bread as urban labourers and  o ce  workers,  and  the  preceding  10,000  years,  during  which  most  Sapiens lived  as  farmers  and  herders,  are  the  blink  of  an  eye  compared  to  the  tens  of thousands of years during which our ancestors hunted and gathered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ourishing  eld  of  evolutionary  psychology  argues  that  many  of  our present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped during this long pre-agricultural era. Even today, scholars in this  eld claim, our brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and gathering. Our eating habits, our conflicts and our sexuality are all the result of the way our hunter-gatherer minds interact with our  current  post-industrial  environment,  with  its  mega-cities,  aeroplanes, telephones and computers. This environment gives us more material resources and longer lives than those enjoyed by any previous generation, but it often makes us feel  alienated,  depressed  and  pressured.  To  understand  why,  evolutionary psychologists argue, we need to delve into the hunter-gatherer world that shaped us, the world that we subconsciously still inhabit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, for example, do people gorge on high-calorie food that is doing little good to their bodies? Today’s a uent societies are in the throes of a plague of obesity, which is rapidly spreading to developing countries. It’s a puzzle why we binge on the sweetest and greasiest food we can  nd, until we consider the eating habits of our  forager  forebears.  In  the  savannahs  and  forests  they  inhabited,  high-calorie sweets  were  extremely  rare  and  food  in  general  was  in  short  supply.  A  typical forager 30,000 years ago had access to only one type of sweet food – ripe fruit. If a Stone Age woman came across a tree groaning with  gs, the most sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot, before the local baboon band  picked  the  tree  bare.  The  instinct  to  gorge  on  high-calorie  food  was  hard-wired into our genes. Today we may be living in high-rise apartments with over-stu ed refrigerators, but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah. That’s what makes  us  spoon  down  an  entire  tub  of  Ben  &amp;  Jerry’s  when  we  nd  one  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>freezer and wash it down with a jumbo Coke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  ‘gorging  gene’  theory  is  widely  accepted.  Other  theories  are  far  more contentious.  For  example,  some  evolutionary  psychologists  argue  that  ancient foraging  bands  were  not  composed  of  nuclear  families  centred  on  monogamous couples.  Rather,  foragers  lived  in  communes  devoid  of  private  property, monogamous relationships and even fatherhood. In such a band, a woman could have sex and form intimate bonds with several men (and women) simultaneously, and  all  of  the  band’s  adults  cooperated  in  parenting  its  children.  Since  no  man knew de nitively which of the children were his, men showed equal concern for all youngsters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such a social structure is not an Aquarian utopia. It’s well documented among animals,  notably  our  closest  relatives,  the  chimpanzees  and  bonobos.  There  are even  a  number  of  present-day  human  cultures  in  which  collective  fatherhood  is practised, as for example among the Barí Indians. According to the beliefs of such societies,  a  child  is  not  born  from  the  sperm  of  a  single  man,  but  from  the accumulation of sperm in a woman’s womb. A good mother will make a point of having sex with several different men, especially when she is pregnant, so that her child will enjoy the qualities (and paternal care) not merely of the best hunter, but also of the best storyteller, the strongest warrior and the most considerate lover. If this  sounds  silly,  bear  in  mind  that  before  the  development  of  modern embryological studies, people had no solid evidence that babies are always sired by a single father rather than by many. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  proponents  of  this  ‘ancient  commune’  theory  argue  that  the  frequent in delities that characterise modern marriages, and the high rates of divorce, not to mention the cornucopia of psychological complexes from which both children and adults su er, all result from forcing humans to live in nuclear families and monogamous relationships that are incompatible with our biological software. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many scholars vehemently reject this theory, insisting that both monogamy and the  forming  of  nuclear  families  are  core  human  behaviours.  Though  ancient hunter-gatherer  societies  tended  to  be  more  communal  and  egalitarian  than modern  societies,  these  researchers  argue,  they  were  nevertheless  comprised  of separate  cells,  each  containing  a  jealous  couple  and  the  children  they  held  in common.  This  is  why  today  monogamous  relationships  and  nuclear  families  are the norm in the vast majority of cultures, why men and women tend to be very possessive of their partners and children, and why even in modern states such as North Korea and Syria political authority passes from father to son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to resolve this controversy and understand our sexuality, society and politics, we need to learn something about the living conditions of our ancestors, to examine how Sapiens lived between the Cognitive Revolution of 70,000 years ago, and the start of the Agricultural Revolution about 12,000 years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Unfortunately,  there  are  few  certainties  regarding  the  lives  of  our  forager ancestors.  The  debate  between  the  ‘ancient  commune’  and  ‘eternal  monogamy schools is based on  imsy evidence. We obviously have no written records from the age of foragers, and the archaeological evidence consists mainly of fossilised bones  and  stone  tools.  Artefacts  made  of  more  perishable  materials  –  such  as wood,  bamboo  or  leather  –  survive  only  under  unique  conditions.  The  common impression  that  pre-agricultural  humans  lived  in  an  age  of  stone  is  a misconception  based  on  this  archaeological  bias.  The  Stone  Age  should  more accurately  be  called  the  Wood  Age,  because  most  of  the  tools  used  by  ancient hunter-gatherers were made of wood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any  reconstruction  of  the  lives  of  ancient  hunter-gatherers  from  the  surviving artefacts  is  extremely  problematic.  One  of  the  most  glaring  di erences  between the  ancient  foragers  and  their  agricultural and  industrial  descendants  is  that foragers had very few artefacts to begin with, and these played a comparatively modest role in their lives. Over the course of his or her life, a typical member of a modern a uent society will own several million artefacts – from cars and houses to  disposable  nappies  and  milk  cartons.  There’s  hardly  an  activity,  a  belief,  or even an emotion that is not mediated by objects of our own devising. Our eating habits are mediated by a mind-boggling collection of such items, from spoons and glasses to genetic engineering labs and gigantic ocean-going ships. In play, we use a  plethora  of  toys,  from  plastic  cards  to  100,000-seater  stadiums.  Our  romantic and  sexual  relations  are  accoutred  by  rings,  beds,  nice  clothes,  sexy  underwear, condoms,  fashionable  restaurants,  cheap  motels,  airport  lounges,  wedding  halls and  catering  companies.  Religions  bring  the  sacred  into  our  lives  with  Gothic churches, Muslim mosques, Hindu ashrams, Torah scrolls, Tibetan prayer wheels, priestly cassocks, candles, incense, Christmas trees, matzah balls, tombstones and icons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We hardly notice how ubiquitous our stu  is until we have to move it to a new house.  Foragers  moved  house  every  month,  every  week,  and  sometimes  even every  day,  toting  whatever  they  had  on  their  backs.  There  were  no  moving companies, wagons, or even pack animals to share the burden. They consequently had  to  make  do  with  only  the  most  essential  possessions.  It’s  reasonable  to presume, then, that the greater part of their mental, religious and emotional lives was  conducted  without  the  help  of  artefacts.  An  archaeologist  working  100,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">years  from  now  could  piece  together  a  reasonable  picture  of  Muslim  belief  and practice  from  the  myriad  objects  he  unearthed  in  a  ruined  mosque.  But  we  are largely at a loss in trying to comprehend the beliefs and rituals of ancient hunter-gatherers. It’s much the same dilemma that a future historian would face if he had to depict the social world of twenty- rst-century teenagers solely on the basis of their  surviving  snail  mail  –  since  no  records  will  remain  of  their  phone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>conversations, emails, blogs and text messages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A reliance on artefacts will thus bias an account of ancient hunter-gatherer life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  way  to  remedy  this  is  to  look  at  modern  forager  societies.  These  can  be studied directly, by anthropological observation. But there are good reasons to be very careful in extrapolating from modern forager societies to ancient ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Firstly, all forager societies that have survived into the modern era have been in uenced by neighbouring agricultural and industrial societies. Consequently, it’s risky to assume that what is true of them was also true tens of thousands of years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, modern forager societies have survived mainly in areas with di cult climatic  conditions  and  inhospitable  terrain,  ill-suited  for  agriculture.  Societies that have adapted to the extreme conditions of places such as the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa may well provide a very misleading model for understanding ancient societies in fertile areas such as the Yangtze River Valley. In particular, population  density  in  an  area  like  the  Kalahari  Desert  is  far  lower  than  it  was around  the  ancient  Yangtze,  and  this  has  far-reaching  implications  for  key questions about the size and structure of human bands and the relations between them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirdly,  the  most  notable  characteristic  of  hunter-gatherer  societies  is  how di erent they are one from the other. They di er not only from one part of the world  to  another  but  even  in  the  same  region.  One  good  example  is  the  huge variety the first European settlers found among the Aborigine peoples of Australia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  before  the  British  conquest,  between  300,000  and  700,000  hunter-gatherers lived on the continent in 200–600 tribes, each of which was further divided into several  bands. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">2</a>  Each  tribe  had  its  own  language,  religion,  norms  and  customs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Living around what is now Adelaide in southern Australia were several patrilineal clans  that  reckoned  descent  from  the  father’s  side.  These  clans  bonded  together into  tribes  on  a  strictly  territorial  basis.  In  contrast,  some  tribes  in  northern Australia gave more importance to a person’s maternal ancestry, and a person’s tribal identity depended on his or her totem rather than his territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It stands to reason that the ethnic and cultural variety among ancient hunter-gatherers was equally impressive, and that the 5 million to 8 million foragers who populated the world on the eve of the Agricultural Revolution were divided into thousands of separate tribes with thousands of di erent languages and cultures. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This, after all, was one of the main legacies of the Cognitive Revolution. Thanks to  the  appearance  of  ction,  even  people  with  the  same  genetic  make-up  who lived  under  similar  ecological  conditions  were  able  to  create  very  di erent imagined realities, which manifested themselves in different norms and values. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  there’s  every  reason  to  believe  that  a  forager  band  that  lived 30,000  years  ago  on  the  spot  where  Oxford  University  now  stands  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>spoken  a  di erent  language  from  one  living  where  Cambridge  is  now  situated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  band  might  have  been  belligerent  and  the  other  peaceful.  Perhaps  the Cambridge  band  was  communal  while  the  one  at  Oxford  was  based  on  nuclear families. The Cantabrigians might have spent long hours carving wooden statues of  their  guardian  spirits,  whereas  the  Oxonians  may  have  worshipped  through dance. The former perhaps believed in reincarnation, while the latter thought this was nonsense. In one society, homosexual relationships might have been accepted, while in the other they were taboo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, while anthropological observations of modern foragers can help us understand some of the possibilities available to ancient foragers, the ancient horizon of possibilities was much broader, and most of it is hidden from our view. <a href="#p58">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The heated debates about  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>’ ‘natural way of life’ miss the main point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Original Affluent Society</p>
<p class="calibre1">What  generalisations  can  we  make  about  life  in  the  pre-agricultural  world nevertheless? It seems safe to say that the vast majority of people lived in small bands numbering several dozen or at most several hundred individuals, and that all these individuals were humans. It is important to note this last point, because it  is  far  from  obvious.  Most  members  of  agricultural  and  industrial  societies  are domesticated animals. They are not equal to their masters, of course, but they are members all the same. Today, the society called New Zealand is composed of 4.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">million Sapiens and 50 million sheep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was just one exception to this general rule: the dog. The dog was the  rst animal  domesticated  by  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>,  and  this  occurred  <i class="calibre4">before</i>  the  Agricultural Revolution.  Experts  disagree  about  the  exact  date,  but  we  have  incontrovertible evidence  of  domesticated  dogs  from  about  15,000  years  ago.  They  may  have joined the human pack thousands of years earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dogs were used for hunting and  ghting, and as an alarm system against wild beasts and human intruders. With the passing of generations, the two species co-evolved to communicate well with each other. Dogs that were most attentive to the needs and feelings of their human companions got extra care and food, and were more likely to survive. Simultaneously, dogs learned to manipulate people for their own needs. A 15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper understanding and  a ection  between  humans  and  dogs  than  between  humans  and  any  other</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a><img src="index-45_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">animal. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">4  </a>In  some  cases  dead  dogs  were  even  buried  ceremoniously,  much  like humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Members  of  a  band  knew  each  other  very  intimately,  and  were  surrounded throughout their lives by friends and relatives. Loneliness and privacy were rare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neighbouring  bands  probably  competed  for  resources  and  even  fought  one another,  but  they  also  had  friendly  contacts.  They  exchanged  members,  hunted together, traded rare luxuries, cemented political alliances and celebrated religious festivals. Such cooperation was one of the important trademarks of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>, and  gave  it  a  crucial  edge  over  other  human  species.  Sometimes  relations  with neighbouring  bands  were  tight  enough  that  together  they  constituted  a  single tribe,  sharing  a  common  language,  common  myths,  and  common  norms  and values. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet we should not overestimate the importance of such external relations. Even if  in  times  of  crisis  neighbouring  bands  drew  closer  together,  and  even  if  they occasionally gathered to hunt or feast together, they still spent the vast majority of their time in complete isolation and independence. Trade was mostly limited to prestige  items  such  as  shells,  amber  and  pigments.  There  is  no  evidence  that people traded staple goods like fruits and meat, or that the existence of one band depended  on  the  importing  of  goods  from  another.  Sociopolitical  relations,  too, tended to be sporadic. The tribe did not serve as a permanent political framework, and  even  if  it  had  seasonal  meeting  places,  there  were  no  permanent  towns  or institutions. The average person lived many months without seeing or hearing a human from outside of her own band, and she encountered throughout her life no more than a few hundred humans. The Sapiens population was thinly spread over vast territories. Before the Agricultural Revolution, the human population of the entire planet was smaller than that of today’s Cairo. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Her left hand is resting on the dog in a way that might indicate an emotional connection. There are, of</b> <b class="calibre3">course, other possible explanations. Perhaps, for example, the puppy was a gift to the gatekeeper of the</b> <b class="calibre3">next world</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most Sapiens bands lived on the road, roaming from place to place in search of food.  Their  movements  were  in uenced  by  the  changing  seasons,  the  annual migrations of animals and the growth cycles of plants. They usually travelled back and forth across the same home territory, an area of between several dozen and many hundreds of square kilometres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occasionally,  bands  wandered  outside  their  turf  and  explored  new  lands, whether due to natural calamities, violent con icts, demographic pressures or the initiative  of  a  charismatic  leader.  These  wanderings  were  the  engine  of  human worldwide  expansion.  If  a  forager  band  split  once  every  forty  years  and  its splinter group migrated to a new territory a hundred kilometres to the east, the distance  from  East  Africa  to  China  would  have  been  covered  in  about  10,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  some  exceptional  cases,  when  food  sources  were  particularly  rich,  bands settled  down  in  seasonal  and  even  permanent  camps.  Techniques  for  drying, smoking  and  freezing  food  also  made  it  possible  to  stay  put  for  longer  periods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  importantly,  alongside  seas  and  rivers  rich  in  seafood  and  waterfowl, humans  set  up  permanent  shing  villages  –  the  rst  permanent  settlements  in history,  long  predating  the  Agricultural  Revolution.  Fishing  villages  might  have appeared on the coasts of Indonesian islands as early as 45,000 years ago. These may have been the base from which  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> launched its  rst transoceanic enterprise: the invasion of Australia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  most  habitats,  Sapiens  bands  fed  themselves  in  an  elastic  and  opportunistic fashion. They scrounged for termites, picked berries, dug for roots, stalked rabbits and hunted bison and mammoth. Notwithstanding the popular image of ‘man the hunter’,  gathering  was  Sapiens’  main  activity,  and  it  provided  most  of  their calories, as well as raw materials such as flint, wood and bamboo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sapiens did not forage only for food and materials. They foraged for knowledge as  well.  To  survive,  they  needed  a  detailed  mental  map  of  their  territory.  To maximise the e ciency of their daily search for food, they required information about  the  growth  patterns  of  each  plant  and  the  habits  of  each  animal.  They needed to know which foods were nourishing, which made you sick, and how to use others as cures. They needed to know the progress of the seasons and what warning signs preceded a thunderstorm or a dry spell. They studied every stream, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>every walnut tree, every bear cave, and every  int-stone deposit in their vicinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each individual had to understand how to make a stone knife, how to mend a torn cloak, how to lay a rabbit trap, and how to face avalanches, snakebites or hungry lions. Mastery of each of these many skills required years of apprenticeship and practice. The average ancient forager could turn a  int stone into a spear point within minutes. When we try to imitate this feat, we usually fail miserably. Most of us lack expert knowledge of the  aking properties of  int and basalt and the fine motor skills needed to work them precisely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  other  words,  the  average  forager  had  wider,  deeper  and  more  varied knowledge of her immediate surroundings than most of her modern descendants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,  most  people  in  industrial  societies  don’t  need  to  know  much  about  the natural world in order to survive. What do you really need to know in order to get by  as  a  computer  engineer,  an  insurance  agent,  a  history  teacher  or  a  factory worker? You need to know a lot about your own tiny  eld of expertise, but for the vast  majority  of  life’s  necessities  you  rely  blindly  on  the  help  of  other  experts, whose  own  knowledge  is  also  limited  to  a  tiny  eld  of  expertise.  The  human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually <i class="calibre4">decreased</i> since the age of foraging. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">5</a> Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’</p>
<p class="calibre1">were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foragers  mastered  not  only  the  surrounding  world  of  animals,  plants  and objects, but also the internal world of their own bodies and senses. They listened to the slightest movement in the grass to learn whether a snake might be lurking there.  They  carefully  observed  the  foliage  of  trees  in  order  to  discover  fruits, beehives  and  bird  nests.  They  moved  with  a  minimum  of  e ort  and  noise,  and knew how to sit, walk and run in the most agile and e cient manner. Varied and constant  use  of  their  bodies  made  them  as  t  as  marathon  runners.  They  had physical  dexterity  that  people  today  are  unable  to  achieve  even  after  years  of practising yoga or t’ai chi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hunter-gatherer  way  of  life  di ered  signi cantly  from  region  to  region  and from season to season, but on the whole foragers seem to have enjoyed a more comfortable  and  rewarding  lifestyle  than  most of  the  peasants,  shepherds, labourers and office clerks who followed in their footsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While people in today’s a uent societies work an average of forty to forty- ve hours  a  week,  and  people  in  the  developing  world  work  sixty  and  even  eighty</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>hours a week, hunter-gatherers living today in the most inhospitable of habitats –</p>
<p class="calibre1">such as the Kalahari Desert work on average for just thirty- ve to forty- ve hours a week. They hunt only one day out of three, and gathering takes up just three to six hours daily. In normal times, this is enough to feed the band. It may well be that ancient hunter-gatherers living in zones more fertile than the Kalahari spent even less time obtaining food and raw materials. On top of that, foragers enjoyed a  lighter  load  of  household  chores.  They  had  no  dishes  to  wash,  no  carpets  to vacuum, no floors to polish, no nappies to change and no bills to pay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  forager  economy  provided  most  people  with  more  interesting  lives  than agriculture  or  industry  do.  Today,  a  Chinese  factory  hand  leaves  home  around seven in the morning, makes her way through polluted streets to a sweatshop, and there operates the same machine, in the same way, day in, day out, for ten long and mind-numbing hours, returning home around seven in the evening in order to wash  dishes  and  do  the  laundry.  Thirty  thousand  years  ago,  a  Chinese  forager might leave camp with her companions at, say, eight in the morning. They’d roam the nearby forests and meadows, gathering mushrooms, digging up edible roots, catching  frogs  and  occasionally  running  away  from  tigers.  By  early  afternoon, they  were  back  at  the  camp  to  make  lunch.  That  left  them  plenty  of  time  to gossip, tell stories, play with the children and just hang out. Of course the tigers sometimes  caught  them,  or  a  snake  bit  them,  but  on  the  other  hand  they  didn’t have to deal with automobile accidents and industrial pollution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  most  places  and  at  most  times,  foraging  provided  ideal  nutrition.  That  is hardly  surprising  –  this  had  been  the  human  diet  for  hundreds  of  thousands  of years,  and  the  human  body  was  well  adapted  to  it.  Evidence  from  fossilised skeletons indicates that ancient foragers were less likely to su er from starvation or  malnutrition,  and  were  generally  taller  and  healthier  than  their  peasant descendants. Average life expectancy was apparently just thirty to forty years, but this was due largely to the high incidence of child mortality. Children who made it through  the  perilous  rst  years  had  a  good  chance  of  reaching  the  age  of  sixty, and some even made it to their eighties. Among modern foragers, forty- ve-year-old women can expect to live another twenty years, and about 5–8 per cent of the population is over sixty. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  foragers’  secret  of  success,  which  protected  them  from  starvation  and malnutrition,  was  their  varied  diet.  Farmers  tend  to  eat  a  very  limited  and unbalanced diet. Especially in premodern times, most of the calories feeding an agricultural population came from a single crop – such as wheat, potatoes or rice</p>
<p class="calibre1">– that lacks some of the vitamins, minerals and other nutritional materials humans need.  The  typical  peasant  in  traditional  China  ate  rice  for  breakfast,  rice  for lunch, and rice for dinner. If she were lucky, she could expect to eat the same on the following day. By contrast, ancient foragers regularly ate dozens of di erent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>foodstu s.  The  peasant’s  ancient  ancestor,  the  forager,  may  have  eaten  berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits, snails and turtle for lunch; and rabbit steak with  wild  onions  for  dinner.  Tomorrows  menu  might  have  been  completely di erent. This variety ensured that the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, by not being dependent on any single kind of food, they were less liable to su er when one particular food source failed. Agricultural societies are ravaged by famine when drought,  re or earthquake devastates the annual rice or potato  crop.  Forager  societies  were  hardly  immune  to  natural  disasters,  and su ered from periods of want and hunger, but they were usually able to deal with such calamities more easily. If they lost some of their staple foodstu s, they could gather or hunt other species, or move to a less affected area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ancient  foragers  also  su ered  less  from  infectious  diseases.  Most  of  the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies (such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated animals and were transferred  to  humans  only  after  the  Agricultural  Revolution.  Ancient  foragers, who  had  domesticated  only  dogs,  were  free  of  these  scourges.  Moreover,  most people  in  agricultural  and  industrial  societies  lived  in  dense,  unhygienic permanent  settlements  –  ideal  hotbeds  for  disease.  Foragers  roamed  the  land  in small bands that could not sustain epidemics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wholesome and varied diet, the relatively short working week, and the rarity of  infectious  diseases  have  led  many  experts  to  de ne  pre-agricultural  forager societies  as  ‘the  original  a uent  societies’.  It  would  be  a  mistake,  however,  to idealise the lives of these ancients. Though they lived better lives than most people in  agricultural  and  industrial  societies,  their  world  could  still  be  harsh  and unforgiving.  Periods  of  want  and  hardship  were  not  uncommon,  child  mortality was  high,  and  an  accident  which  would  be  minor  today  could  easily  become  a death sentence. Most people probably enjoyed the close intimacy of the roaming band, but those unfortunates who incurred the hostility or mockery of their fellow band members probably su ered terribly. Modern foragers occasionally abandon and  even  kill  old  or  disabled  people  who  cannot  keep  up  with  the  band. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unwanted  babies  and  children  may  be  slain,  and  there  are  even  cases  of religiously inspired human sacrifice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Aché  people,  hunter-gatherers  who  lived  in  the  jungles  of  Paraguay  until the 1960s, o er a glimpse into the darker side of foraging. When a valued band member died, the Aché customarily killed a little girl and buried the two together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anthropologists  who  interviewed  the  Aché  recorded  a  case  in  which  a  band abandoned a middle-aged man who fell sick and was unable to keep up with the others. He was left under a tree. Vultures perched above him, expecting a hearty</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>meal. But the man recuperated, and, walking briskly, he managed to rejoin the band.  His  body  was  covered  with  the  birds’  faeces,  so  he  was  henceforth nicknamed ‘Vulture Droppings’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When an old Aché woman became a burden to the rest of the band, one of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">younger men would sneak behind her and kill her with an axe-blow to the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An Aché man told the inquisitive anthropologists stories of his prime years in the jungle.  ‘I  customarily  killed  old  women.  I  used  to  kill  my  aunts  …  The  women were afraid of me … Now, here with the whites, I have become weak.’ Babies born without hair, who were considered underdeveloped, were killed immediately. One woman recalled that her  rst baby girl was killed because the men in the band did not want another girl. On another occasion a man killed a small boy because he was  ‘in  a  bad  mood  and  the  child  was  crying’.  Another  child  was  buried  alive because ‘it was funny-looking and the other children laughed at it’. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We should be careful, though, not to judge the Aché too quickly. Anthropologists who lived with them for years report that violence between adults was very rare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  women  and  men  were  free  to  change  partners  at  will.  They  smiled  and laughed  constantly,  had  no  leadership  hierarchy,  and  generally  shunned domineering  people.  They  were  extremely  generous  with  their  few  possessions, and were not obsessed with success or wealth. The things they valued most in life were  good  social  interactions  and  high-quality  friendships<a href="index_split_005.html#p354">.8</a>  They  viewed  the killing  of  children,  sick  people  and  the  elderly  as  many  people  today  view abortion and euthanasia. It should also be noted that the Aché were hunted and killed  without  mercy  by  Paraguayan  farmers.  The  need  to  evade  their  enemies probably  caused  the  Aché  to  adopt  an  exceptionally  harsh  attitude  towards anyone who might become a liability to the band. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The truth is that Aché society, like every human society, was very complex. We should  beware  of  demonising  or  idealising  it  on  the  basis  of  a  super cial acquaintance. The Aché were neither angels nor  ends – they were humans. So, too, were the ancient hunter-gatherers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talking Ghosts</p>
<p class="calibre1">What  can  we  say  about  the  spiritual  and  mental  life  of  the  ancient  hunter-gatherers?  The  basics  of  the  forager  economy  can  be  reconstructed  with  some con dence  based  on  quanti able  and  objective  factors.  For  example,  we  can calculate  how  many  calories  per  day  a  person  needed  in  order  to  survive,  how many calories were obtained from a kilogram of walnuts, and how many walnuts could be gathered from a square kilometre of forest. With this data, we can make</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>an educated guess about the relative importance of walnuts in their diet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But did they consider walnuts a delicacy or a humdrum staple? Did they believe that walnut trees were inhabited by spirits? Did they  nd walnut leaves pretty? If a forager boy wanted to take a forager girl to a romantic spot, did the shade of a walnut  tree  su ce? The world of thought, belief and feeling is by de nition far more difficult to decipher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  scholars  agree  that  animistic  beliefs  were  common  among  ancient foragers. Animism (from ‘ <i class="calibre4">anima</i>’, ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ in Latin) is the belief that almost every  place,  every  animal,  every  plant  and  every  natural  phenomenon  has awareness  and  feelings,  and  can  communicate  directly  with  humans.  Thus, animists may believe that the big rock at the top of the hill has desires and needs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rock might be angry about something that people did and rejoice over some other  action.  The  rock  might  admonish  people  or  ask  for  favours.  Humans,  for their part, can address the rock, to mollify or threaten it. Not only the rock, but also  the  oak  tree  at  the  bottom  of  the  hill  is  an  animated  being,  and  so  is  the stream  owing below the hill, the spring in the forest clearing, the bushes growing around it, the path to the clearing, and the field mice, wolves and crows that drink there. In the animist world, objects and living things are not the only animated beings. There are also immaterial entities – the spirits of the dead, and friendly and malevolent beings, the kind that we today call demons, fairies and angels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Animists believe that there is no barrier between humans and other beings. They can all communicate directly through speech, song, dance and ceremony. A hunter may address a herd of deer and ask that one of them sacri ce itself. If the hunt succeeds, the hunter may ask the dead animal to forgive him. When someone falls sick, a shaman can contact the spirit that caused the sickness and try to pacify it or scare it away. If need be, the shaman may ask for help from other spirits. What characterises all these acts of communication is that the entities being addressed are  local  beings.  They  are  not  universal  gods,  but  rather  a  particular  deer,  a particular tree, a particular stream, a particular ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as there is no barrier between humans and other beings, neither is there a strict hierarchy. Non-human entities do not exist merely to provide for the needs of man. Nor are they all-powerful gods who run the world as they wish. The world does not revolve around humans or around any other particular group of beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Animism  is  not  a  speci c  religion.  It  is  a  generic  name  for  thousands  of  very di erent  religions,  cults  and  beliefs.  What  makes  all  of them  ‘animist’  is  this common  approach  to  the  world  and  to  man’s  place  in  it.  Saying  that  ancient foragers were probably animists is like saying that premodern agriculturists were mostly theists. Theism (from ‘ <i class="calibre4">theos</i>’, ‘god’ in Greek) is the view that the universal order is based on a hierarchical relationship between humans and a small group of ethereal  entities  called  gods.  It  is  certainly  true  to  say  that  premodern</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>agriculturists  tended  to  be  theists,  but  it  does  not  teach  us  much  about  the particulars.  The  generic  rubric  ‘theists’  covers  Jewish  rabbis  from  eighteenth-century  Poland,  witch-burning  Puritans  from  seventeenth-century  Massachusetts, Aztec  priests  from  fteenth-century  Mexico,  Su   mystics  from  twelfth-century Iran, tenth-century Viking warriors, second-century Roman legionnaires, and  rst-century Chinese bureaucrats. Each of these viewed the others’ beliefs and practices as weird and heretical. The di erences between the beliefs and practices of groups of ‘animistic’ foragers were probably just as big. Their religious experience may have been turbulent and filled with controversies, reforms and revolutions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But these cautious generalisations are about as far as we can go. Any attempt to describe the specifics of archaic spirituality is highly speculative, as there is next to no evidence to go by and the little evidence we have – a handful of artefacts and cave paintings – can be interpreted in myriad ways. The theories of scholars who claim to know what the foragers felt shed much more light on the prejudices of their authors than on Stone Age religions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead  of  erecting  mountains  of  theory  over  a  molehill  of  tomb  relics,  cave paintings and bone statuettes, it is better to be frank and admit that we have only the haziest notions about the religions of ancient foragers. We assume that they were animists, but that’s not very informative. We don’t know which spirits they prayed  to,  which  festivals  they  celebrated,  or  which  taboos  they  observed.  Most importantly, we don’t know what stories they told. It’s one of the biggest holes in our understanding of human history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sociopolitical world of the foragers is another area about which we know next to nothing. As explained above, scholars cannot even agree on the basics, such as the existence of private property, nuclear families and monogamous relationships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s  likely  that  di erent  bands  had  di erent  structures.  Some  may  have  been  as hierarchical,  tense  and  violent  as  the  nastiest  chimpanzee  group,  while  others were as laid-back, peaceful and lascivious as a bunch of bonobos. </p>

If so, the picture depicts not a prosaic hunting accident, but rather the</b> <b class="calibre3">passage from this world to the next. But we have no way of knowing whether any of these speculations</b> <b class="calibre3">are true. It’s a Rorschach test that reveals much about the preconceptions of modern scholars, and little</b> <b class="calibre3">about the beliefs of ancient foragers</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Sungir, Russia, archaeologists discovered in 1955 a 30,000-year-old burial site belonging to a mammoth-hunting culture. In one grave they found the skeleton of a  fty-year-old  man,  covered  with  strings  of  mammoth  ivory  beads,  containing about 3,000 beads in total. On the dead man’s head was a hat decorated with fox teeth, and on his wrists twenty- ve ivory bracelets. Other graves from the same site contained far fewer goods. Scholars deduced that the Sungir mammoth-hunters lived in a hierarchical society, and that the dead man was perhaps the leader of a band or of an entire tribe comprising several bands. It is unlikely that a few dozen members  of  a  single  band  could  have  produced  so  many  grave  goods  by themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">9. </b></a><b class="calibre3"> Hunter-gatherers made these handprints about 9,000 years ago in the ‘Hands Cave’, in Argentina. It</b> <b class="calibre3">looks as if these long-dead hands are reaching towards us from within the rock. This is one of the most</b> <b class="calibre3">moving relics of the ancient forager world – but nobody knows what it means</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Archaeologists then discovered an even more interesting tomb. It contained two skeletons,  buried  head  to  head.  One  belonged  to  a  boy  aged  about  twelve  or thirteen, and the other to a girl of about nine or ten. The boy was covered with 5,000 ivory beads. He wore a fox-tooth hat and a belt with 250 fox teeth (at least sixty foxes had to have their teeth pulled to get that many). The girl was adorned with 5,250 ivory beads. Both children were surrounded by statuettes and various ivory objects. A skilled craftsman (or craftswoman) probably needed about forty-ve minutes to prepare a single ivory bead. In other words, fashioning the 10,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">ivory  beads  that  covered  the  two  children,  not  to  mention  the  other  objects, required some 7,500 hours of delicate work, well over three years of labour by an experienced artisan! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  highly  unlikely  that  at  such  a  young  age  the  Sungir  children  had  proved themselves as leaders or mammoth-hunters. Only cultural beliefs can explain why they received such an extravagant burial. One theory is that they owed their rank to  their  parents.  Perhaps  they  were  the  children  of  the  leader,  in  a  culture  that believed  in  either  family  charisma  or  strict  rules  of  succession.  According  to  a second  theory,  the  children  had  been  identi ed  at  birth  as  the  incarnations  of some long-dead spirits. A third theory argues that the children’s burial re ects the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>way  they  died  rather  than  their  status  in  life.  They  were  ritually  sacri ced  –</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps as part of the burial rites of the leader – and then entombed with pomp and circumstance. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever the correct answer, the Sungir children are among the best pieces of evidence that 30,000 years ago Sapiens could invent sociopolitical codes that went far  beyond  the  dictates  of  our  DNA  and  the  behaviour  patterns  of  other  human and animal species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peace or War? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, there’s the thorny question of the role of war in forager societies. Some scholars  imagine  ancient  hunter-gatherer  societies  as  peaceful  paradises,  and argue that war and violence began only with the Agricultural Revolution, when people started to accumulate private property. Other scholars maintain that the world of the ancient foragers was exceptionally cruel and violent. Both schools of thought  are  castles  in  the  air,  connected  to  the  ground  by  the  thin  strings  of meagre  archaeological  remains  and  anthropological  observations  of  present-day foragers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The anthropological evidence is intriguing but very problematic. Foragers today live mainly in isolated and inhospitable areas such as the Arctic or the Kalahari, where population density is very low and opportunities to  ght other people are limited. Moreover, in recent generations, foragers have been increasingly subject to  the  authority  of  modern  states,  which  prevent  the  eruption  of  large-scale con icts. European scholars have had only two opportunities to observe large and relatively  dense  populations  of  independent  foragers:  in  north-western  North America  in  the  nineteenth  century,  and  in  northern  Australia  during  the nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries.  Both  Amerindian  and  Aboriginal Australian  cultures  witnessed  frequent  armed  con icts.  It  is  debatable,  however, whether  this  represents  a  ‘timeless’  condition  or  the  impact  of  European imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  archaeological  ndings  are  both  scarce  and  opaque.  What  telltale  clues might remain of any war that took place tens of thousands of years ago? There were no forti cations and walls back then, no artillery shells or even swords and shields.  An  ancient  spear  point  might  have  been  used  in  war,  but  it  could  have been used in a hunt as well. Fossilised human bones are no less hard to interpret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  fracture  might  indicate  a  war  wound  or  an  accident.  Nor  is  the  absence  of fractures  and  cuts  on  an  ancient  skeleton  conclusive  proof  that  the  person  to whom the skeleton belonged did not die a violent death. Death can be caused by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>trauma  to  soft  tissues  that  leaves  no  marks  on  bone.  Even  more  importantly, during pre-industrial warfare more than 90 per cent of war dead were killed by starvation, cold and disease rather than by weapons. Imagine that 30,000 years ago  one  tribe  defeated  its  neighbour  and  expelled  it  from  coveted  foraging grounds. In the decisive battle, ten members of the defeated tribe were killed. In the  following  year,  another  hundred  members  of  the  losing  tribe  died  from starvation,  cold  and  disease.  Archaeologists  who  come  across  these  no  skeletons may too easily conclude that most fell victim to some natural disaster. How would we be able to tell that they were all victims of a merciless war? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Duly  warned,  we  can  now  turn  to  the  archaeological  ndings.  In  Portugal,  a survey  was  made  of  400  skeletons  from  the  period  immediately  predating  the Agricultural  Revolution.  Only  two  skeletons  showed  clear  marks  of  violence.  A similar survey of 400 skeletons from the same period in Israel discovered a single crack in a single skull that could be attributed to human violence. A third survey of  400  skeletons  from  various  pre-agricultural  sites  in  the  Danube  Valley  found evidence  of  violence  on  eighteen  skeletons.  Eighteen  out  of  400  may  not  sound like  a  lot,  but  it’s  actually  a  very  high  percentage.  If  all  eighteen  indeed  died violently, it means that about 4.5 per cent of deaths in the ancient Danube Valley were caused by human violence. Today, the global average is only 1.5 per cent, taking war and crime together. During the twentieth century, only 5 per cent of human deaths resulted from human violence – and this in a century that saw the bloodiest wars and most massive genocides in history. If this revelation is typical, the ancient Danube Valley was as violent as the twentieth century. <a href="#p58">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  depressing  ndings  from  the  Danube  Valley  are  supported  by  a  string  of equally depressing  ndings from other areas. At Jabl Sahaba in Sudan, a 12,000-year-old cemetery containing  fty-nine skeletons was discovered. Arrowheads and spear  points  were  found  embedded  in  or  lying  near  the  bones  of  twenty-four skeletons,  40  per  cent  of  the  nd.  The  skeleton  of  one  woman  revealed  twelve injuries. In Ofnet Cave in Bavaria, archaeologists discovered the remains of thirty-eight foragers, mainly women and children, who had been thrown into two burial pits. Half the skeletons, including those of children and babies, bore clear signs of damage by human weapons such as clubs and knives. The few skeletons belonging to  mature  males  bore  the  worst  marks  of  violence.  In  all  probability,  an  entire forager band was massacred at Ofnet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which better represents the world of the ancient foragers: the peaceful skeletons from Israel and Portugal, or the abattoirs of Jabl Sahaba and Ofnet? The answer is neither. Just as foragers exhibited a wide array of religions and social structures, so,  too,  did  they  probably  demonstrate  a  variety  of  violence  rates.  While  some areas and some periods of time may have enjoyed peace and tranquillity, others were riven by ferocious conflicts. <a href="index_split_005.html#p354">10</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>The Curtain of Silence</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the larger picture of ancient forager life is hard to reconstruct, particular events are largely irretrievable. When a Sapiens band  rst entered a valley inhabited by Neanderthals, the following years might have witnessed a breathtaking historical drama.  Unfortunately,  nothing  would  have  survived  from  such  an  encounter except,  at  best,  a  few  fossilised  bones  and  a  handful  of  stone  tools  that  remain mute  under  the  most  intense  scholarly  inquisitions.  We  may  extract  from  them information about human anatomy, human technology, human diet, and perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">even human social structure. But they reveal nothing about the political alliance forged  between  neighbouring  Sapiens  bands,  about  the  spirits  of  the  dead  that blessed  this  alliance,  or  about  the  ivory  beads  secretly  given  to  the  local  witch doctor in order to secure the blessing of the spirits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This curtain of silence shrouds tens of thousands of years of history. These long millennia  may  well  have  witnessed  wars  and  revolutions,  ecstatic  religious movements, profound philosophical theories, incomparable artistic masterpieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  foragers  may  have  had  their  all-conquering  Napoleons,  who  ruled  empires half the size of Luxembourg; gifted Beethovens who lacked symphony orchestras but brought people to tears with the sound of their bamboo  utes; and charismatic prophets  who  revealed  the  words  of  a  local  oak  tree  rather  than  those  of  a universal creator god. But these are all mere guesses. The curtain of silence is so thick that we cannot even be sure such things occurred – let alone describe them in detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scholars  tend  to  ask  only  those  questions  that  they  can  reasonably  expect  to answer.  Without  the  discovery  of  as  yet  unavailable  research  tools,  we  will probably never know what the ancient foragers believed or what political dramas they  experienced.  Yet  it  is  vital  to  ask  questions  for  which  no  answers  are available,  otherwise  we  might  be  tempted  to  dismiss  60,000  of  70,000  years  of human history with the excuse that ‘the people who lived back then did nothing of importance’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The truth is that they did a lot of important things. In particular, they shaped the world around us to a much larger degree than most people realise. Trekkers visiting  the  Siberian  tundra,  the  deserts  of  central  Australia  and  the  Amazonian rainforest believe that they have entered pristine landscapes, virtually untouched by human hands. But that’s an illusion. The foragers were there before us and they brought about dramatic changes even in the densest jungles and the most desolate wildernesses. The next chapter explains how the foragers completely reshaped the ecology  of  our  planet  long  before  the  rst  agricultural  village  was  built.  The wandering  bands  of  storytelling  Sapiens  were  the  most  important  and  most destructive force the animal kingdom had ever produced. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a><a href="#p44">* </a>A ‘horizon of possibilities’ means the entire spectrum of beliefs, practices and experiences that are open before a particular society, given its ecological, technological and cultural limitations.

<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p56">* </a>It might be argued that not al  eighteen ancient Danubians actual y died from the violence whose marks can be seen on their remains. Some were only injured. However, this is probably counterbalanced by deaths from trauma to soft tissues and from the invisible deprivations that accompany war. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a><b class="calibre3">4</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Flood</p>
<p class="calibre1">PRIOR TO THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION, humans of all species lived exclusively</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  Afro-Asian  landmass.  True,  they  had  settled  a  few  islands  by  swimming short stretches of water or crossing them on improvised rafts. Flores, for example, was colonised as far back as 850,000 years ago. Yet they were unable to venture into the open sea, and none reached America, Australia, or remote islands such as Madagascar, New Zealand and Hawaii. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sea  barrier  prevented  not  just  humans  but  also  many  other  Afro-Asian animals and plants from reaching this ‘Outer World’. As a result, the organisms of distant lands like Australia and Madagascar evolved in isolation for millions upon millions of years, taking on shapes and natures very di erent from those of their distant  Afro-Asian  relatives.  Planet  Earth  was  separated  into  several  distinct ecosystems,  each  made  up  of  a  unique  assembly  of  animals  and  plants.  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i> was about to put an end to this biological exuberance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  the  Cognitive  Revolution,  Sapiens  acquired  the  technology,  the organisational skills, and perhaps even the vision necessary to break out of Afro-Asia and settle the Outer World. Their  rst achievement was the colonisation of Australia some 45,000 years ago. Experts are hard-pressed to explain this feat. In order  to  reach  Australia,  humans  had  to  cross  a  number  of  sea  channels,  some more than a hundred kilometres wide, and upon arrival they had to adapt nearly overnight to a completely new ecosystem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most reasonable theory suggests that, about 45,000 years ago, the Sapiens living in the Indonesian archipelago (a group of islands separated from Asia and from  each  other  by  only  narrow  straits) developed  the  rst  seafaring  societies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They learned how to build and manoeuvre ocean-going vessels and became long-distance  shermen,  traders  and  explorers.  This  would  have  brought  about  an unprecedented  transformation  in  human  capabilities  and  lifestyles.  Every  other mammal that went to sea – seals, sea cows, dolphins – had to evolve for aeons to develop specialised organs and a hydrodynamic body. The Sapiens in Indonesia, descendants of apes who lived on the African savannah, became Paci c seafarers without growing  ippers and without having to wait for their noses to migrate to the top of their heads as whales did. Instead, they built boats and learned how to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>steer them. And these skills enabled them to reach and settle Australia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True, archaeologists have yet to unearth rafts, oars or  shing villages that date back as far as 45,000 years ago (they would be di cult to discover, because rising sea levels have buried the ancient Indonesian shoreline under a hundred metres of ocean).  Nevertheless,  there  is  strong  circumstantial  evidence  to  support  this theory, especially the fact that in the thousands of years following the settlement of Australia, Sapiens colonised a large number of small and isolated islands to its north. Some, such as Buka and Manus, were separated from the closest land by 200 kilometres of open water. It’s hard to believe that anyone could have reached and colonised Manus without sophisticated vessels and sailing skills. As mentioned earlier,  there  is  also  rm  evidence  for  regular  sea  trade  between  some  of  these islands, such as New Ireland and New Britain<a href="index_split_005.html#p355">.1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The journey of the  rst humans to Australia is one of the most important events in history, at least as important as Columbus’ journey to America or the  <i class="calibre4">Apol o 11</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">expedition to the moon. It was the  rst time any human had managed to leave the Afro-Asian ecological system – indeed, the  rst time any large terrestrial mammal had managed to cross from Afro-Asia to Australia. Of even greater importance was what  the  human  pioneers  did  in  this  new  world.  The  moment  the  rst  hunter-gatherer  set  foot  on  an  Australian  beach  was  the  moment  that  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i> climbed to the top rung in the food chain on a particular landmass and thereafter became the deadliest species in the annals of planet Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up  until  then  humans  had  displayed  some  innovative  adaptations and</p>
<p class="calibre1">behaviours, but their e ect on their environment had been negligible. They had demonstrated  remarkable  success  in  moving  into  and  adjusting  to  various habitats, but they did so without drastically changing those habitats. The settlers of  Australia,  or  more  accurately,  its  conquerors,  didn’t  just  adapt,  they transformed the Australian ecosystem beyond recognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst human footprint on a sandy Australian beach was immediately washed away by the waves. Yet when the invaders advanced inland, they left behind a di erent footprint, one that would never be expunged. As they pushed on, they encountered  a  strange  universe  of  unknown  creatures  that  included  a  200-kilogram,  two-metre  kangaroo,  and  a  marsupial  lion,  as  massive  as  a  modern tiger,  that  was  the  continent’s  largest  predator.  Koalas  far  too  big  to  be  cuddly and cute rustled in the trees and  ightless birds twice the size of ostriches sprinted on  the  plains.  Dragon-like  lizards  and  snakes  ve  metres  long  slithered  through the undergrowth. The giant diprotodon, a two-and-a-half-ton wombat, roamed the forests. Except for the birds and reptiles, all these animals were marsupials – like kangaroos,  they  gave  birth  to  tiny,  helpless,  fetus-like  young  which  they  then nurtured  with  milk  in  abdominal  pouches.  Marsupial  mammals  were  almost unknown in Africa and Asia, but in Australia they reigned supreme. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>Within  a  few  thousand  years,  virtually  all  of  these  giants  vanished.  Of  the twenty-four Australian animal species weighing  fty kilograms or more, twenty-three became extinct. <a href="index_split_005.html#p355">2 </a>A large number of smaller species also disappeared. Food chains throughout the entire Australian ecosystem were broken and rearranged. It was the most important transformation of the Australian ecosystem for millions of years. Was it all the fault of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guilty as Charged</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some scholars try to exonerate our species, placing the blame on the vagaries of the climate (the usual scapegoat in such cases). Yet it is hard to believe that  <i class="calibre4">Homo</i> <i class="calibre4">sapiens</i> was completely innocent. There are three pieces of evidence that weaken the  climate  alibi,  and implicate our ancestors in the extinction of the Australian megafauna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Firstly,  even  though  Australia’s  climate  changed  some  45,000  years  ago,  it wasn’t a very remarkable upheaval. It’s hard to see how the new weather patterns alone could have caused such a massive extinction. It’s common today to explain anything  and  everything  as  the  result  of  climate  change,  but  the  truth  is  that earth’s climate never rests. It is in constant  ux. Every event in history occurred against the background of some climate change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  particular,  our  planet  has  experienced  numerous  cycles  of  cooling  and warming.  During  the  last  million  years,  there  has  been  an  ice  age  on  average every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to 15,000 years ago. Not unusually severe for an ice age, it had twin peaks, the  rst about 70,000 years ago and  the  second  at  about  20,000  years  ago.  The  giant  diprotodon  appeared  in Australia more than 1.5 million years ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages. It also survived the  rst peak of the last ice age, around 70,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">years ago. Why, then, did it disappear 45,000 years ago? Of course, if diprotodons had been the only large animal to disappear at this time, it might have been just a uke. But more than 90 per cent of Australia’s megafauna disappeared along with the  diprotodon.  The  evidence  is  circumstantial,  but  it’s  hard  to  imagine  that Sapiens, just by coincidence, arrived in Australia at the precise point that all these animals were dropping dead of the chills<a href="index_split_005.html#p355">.3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly,  when  climate  change  causes  mass  extinctions,  sea  creatures  are usually hit as hard as land dwellers. Yet there is no evidence of any signi cant disappearance of oceanic fauna 45,000 years ago. Human involvement can easily explain  why  the  wave  of  extinction  obliterated  the  terrestrial  megafauna  of Australia  while  sparing  that  of  the  nearby  oceans.  Despite  its  burgeoning</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>navigational abilities,  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> was still overwhelmingly a terrestrial menace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirdly, mass extinctions akin to the archetypal Australian decimation occurred again and again in the ensuing millennia – whenever people settled another part of  the  Outer  World.  In  these  cases  Sapiens  guilt  is  irrefutable.  For  example,  the megafauna of New Zealand – which had weathered the alleged ‘climate change’ of <i class="calibre4">c</i>.45,000  years  ago  without  a  scratch  –  su ered  devastating  blows  immediately after  the  rst  humans  set  foot  on  the  islands.  The  Maoris, New  Zealand’s  rst Sapiens colonisers, reached the islands about 800 years ago. Within a couple of centuries, the majority of the local megafauna was extinct, along with 60 per cent of all bird species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A similar fate befell the mammoth population of Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean (200 kilometres north of the Siberian coast). Mammoths had  ourished for millions  of  years  over  most  of  the  northern  hemisphere,  but  as  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i> spread  –  rst  over  Eurasia  and  then  over  North  America  –  the  mammoths retreated. By 10,000 years ago there was not a single mammoth to be found in the world,  except  on  a  few  remote  Arctic  islands,  most  conspicuously  Wrangel.  The mammoths  of  Wrangel  continued  to  prosper  for  a  few  more  millennia,  then suddenly disappeared about 4,000 years ago, just when the  rst humans reached the island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were  the  Australian  extinction  an  isolated  event,  we  could  grant  humans  the bene t  of  the  doubt.  But  the  historical  record  makes  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  look  like  an ecological serial killer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All the settlers of Australia had at their disposal was Stone Age technology. How could  they  cause  an  ecological  disaster?  There  are  three  explanations  that  mesh quite nicely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Large animals – the primary victims of the Australian extinction – breed slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pregnancy  is  long,  o spring  per  pregnancy  are  few,  and  there  are  long  breaks between  pregnancies.  Consequently,  if  humans  cut  down  even  one  diprotodon every few months, it would be enough to cause diprotodon deaths to outnumber births.  Within  a  few  thousand  years  the  last,  lonesome  diprotodon  would  pass away, and with her the entire species. <a href="index_split_005.html#p355">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  for  all  their  size,  diprotodons  and  Australia’s  other  giants  probably wouldn’t have been that hard to hunt because they would have been taken totally by  surprise  by  their  two-legged  assailants.  Various  human  species  had  been prowling and evolving in Afro-Asia for 2 million years. They slowly honed their hunting  skills,  and  began  going  after  large  animals  around  400,000  years  ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  big  beasts  of  Africa  and  Asia  learned  to  avoid  humans,  so  when  the  new mega-predator  –  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens  –</i>  appeared  on  the  Afro-Asian  scene,  the  large animals already knew to keep their distance from creatures that looked like it. In</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>contrast, the Australian giants had no time to learn to run away. Humans don’t come  across  as  particularly  dangerous.  They  don’t  have  long,  sharp  teeth  or muscular, lithe bodies. So when a diprotodon, the largest marsupial ever to walk the earth, set eyes for the  rst time on this frail-looking ape, he gave it one glance and  then  went  back  to  chewing  leaves.  These  animals  had  to  evolve  a  fear  of humankind, but before they could do so they were gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second explanation is that by the time Sapiens reached Australia, they had already  mastered  re  agriculture.  Faced  with  an  alien  and  threatening environment, they deliberately burned vast areas of impassable thickets and dense forests to create open grasslands, which attracted more easily hunted game, and were better suited to their needs. They thereby completely changed the ecology of large parts of Australia within a few short millennia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One body of evidence supporting this view is the fossil plant record. Eucalyptus trees  were  rare  in  Australia  45,000  years  ago.  But  the  arrival  of  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i> inaugurated  a  golden  age  for  the  species.  Since  eucalyptuses  are  particularly resistant  to  re,  they  spread  far  and  wide  while  other  trees  and  shrubs disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These changes in vegetation in uenced the animals that ate the plants and the carnivores  that  ate  the  vegetarians.  Koalas,  which  subsist  exclusively  on eucalyptus  leaves,  happily  munched  their  way  into  new  territories.  Most  other animals  su ered  greatly.  Many  Australian  food  chains  collapsed,  driving  the weakest links into extinction. <a href="index_split_005.html#p355">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">A third explanation agrees that hunting and  re agriculture played a signi cant role in the extinction, but emphasises that we can’t completely ignore the role of climate.  The  climate  changes  that  beset  Australia  about  45,000  years  ago destabilised  the  ecosystem  and  made  it  particularly  vulnerable.  Under  normal circumstances  the  system  would  probably  have  recuperated,  as  had  happened many  times  previously.  However,  humans  appeared  on  the  stage  at  just  this critical juncture and pushed the brittle ecosystem into the abyss. The combination of  climate  change  and  human  hunting  is  particularly  devastating  for  large animals,  since  it  attacks  them  from  di erent  angles.  It  is  hard  to  nd  a  good survival strategy that will work simultaneously against multiple threats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without  further  evidence,  there’s  no  way  of  deciding  between  the three scenarios. But there are certainly good reasons to believe that if  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> had never gone Down Under, it would still be home to marsupial lions, diprotodons and giant kangaroos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The End of Sloth</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>The  extinction  of  the  Australian  megafauna  was  probably  the  rst  signi cant ma rk  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  left  on  our  planet.  It  was  followed  by  an  even  larger ecological  disaster,  this  time  in  America.  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  was  the  rst  and  only human species to reach the western hemisphere landmass, arriving about 16,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">years  ago,  that  is  in  or  around  14,000 BC.  The  rst  Americans  arrived  on  foot, which they could do because, at the time, sea levels were low enough that a land bridge connected north-eastern Siberia with north-western Alaska. Not that it was easy – the journey was an arduous one, perhaps harder than the sea passage to Australia. To make the crossing, Sapiens  rst had to learn how to withstand the extreme  Arctic  conditions  of  northern  Siberia,  an  area  on  which  the  sun  never shines in winter, and where temperatures can drop to minus fifty degrees Celsius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  previous  human  species  had  managed  to  penetrate  places  like  northern Siberia.  Even  the  cold-adapted  Neanderthals  restricted  themselves  to  relatively warmer  regions  further  south.  But  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>,  whose  body  was  adapted  to living in the African savannah rather than in the lands of snow and ice, devised ingenious solutions. When roaming bands of Sapiens foragers migrated into colder climates,  they  learned  to  make  snowshoes  and  e ective  thermal  clothing composed  of  layers  of  furs  and  skins,  sewn  together  tightly  with  the  help  of needles. They developed new weapons and sophisticated hunting techniques that enabled them to track and kill mammoths and the other big game of the far north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  their  thermal  clothing  and  hunting  techniques  improved,  Sapiens  dared  to venture deeper and deeper into the frozen regions. And as they moved north, their clothes, hunting strategies and other survival skills continued to improve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  why  did  they  bother?  Why  banish  oneself  to  Siberia  by  choice?  Perhaps some  bands  were  driven  north  by  wars,  demographic pressures  or  natural disasters. Others might have been lured northwards by more positive reasons, such as  animal  protein.  The  Arctic  lands  were  full  of  large,  juicy  animals  such  as reindeer and mammoths. Every mammoth was a source of a vast quantity of meat (which, given the frosty temperatures, could even be frozen for later use), tasty fat, warm fur and valuable ivory. As the  ndings from Sungir testify, mammoth-hunters did not just survive in the frozen north – they thrived. As time passed, the bands  spread  far  and  wide,  pursuing  mammoths,  mastodons,  rhinoceroses  and reindeer.  Around  14,000 BC,  the  chase  took  some  of  them  from  north-eastern Siberia to Alaska. Of course, they didn’t know they were discovering a new world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For mammoth and man alike, Alaska was a mere extension of Siberia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  rst, glaciers blocked the way from Alaska to the rest of America, allowing no  more  than  perhaps  a  few  isolated  pioneers  to  investigate  the  lands  further south. However, around 12,000 BC global warming melted the ice and opened an easier  passage.  Making  use  of  the  new  corridor,  people  moved  south  en  masse, spreading over the entire continent. Though originally adapted to hunting large</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>game  in  the  Arctic,  they  soon  adjusted  to  an  amazing  variety  of  climates  and ecosystems.  Descendants  of  the  Siberians  settled  the  thick  forests  of  the  eastern United  States,  the  swamps  of  the  Mississippi  Delta,  the  deserts  of  Mexico  and steaming jungles of Central America. Some made their homes in the river world of the  Amazon  basin,  others  struck  roots  in  Andean  mountain  valleys  or  the  open pampas  of  Argentina.  And  all  this  happened  in  a  mere  millennium  or  two!  By 10,000 BC,  humans  already  inhabited  the  most  southern  point  in  America,  the island  of  Tierra  del  Fuego  at  the  continent’s  southern  tip.  The  human  blitzkrieg across  America  testi es  to  the  incomparable  ingenuity  and  the  unsurpassed adaptability  of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>. No other animal had ever moved into such a huge variety  of  radically  di erent  habitats  so  quickly,  everywhere  using  virtually  the same genes. <a href="index_split_005.html#p355">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  settling  of  America  was  hardly  bloodless.  It  left  behind  a  long  trail  of victims. American fauna 14,000 years ago was far richer than it is today. When the  rst Americans marched south from Alaska into the plains of Canada and the western  United  States, they encountered mammoths and mastodons, rodents the size  of  bears,  herds  of  horses  and  camels,  oversized  lions  and  dozens  of  large species the likes of which are completely unknown today, among them fearsome sabre-tooth cats and giant ground sloths that weighed up to eight tons and reached a  height  of  six  metres.  South  America  hosted  an  even  more  exotic  menagerie  of large  mammals,  reptiles  and  birds.  The  Americas  were  a  great  laboratory  of evolutionary  experimentation,  a  place  where  animals  and  plants  unknown  in Africa and Asia had evolved and thrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no longer. Within 2,000 years of the Sapiens arrival, most of these unique species  were  gone.  According  to  current  estimates,  within  that  short  interval, North  America  lost  thirty-four  out  of  its  forty-seven  genera  of  large  mammals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">South  America  lost  fty  out  of  sixty.  The  sabre-tooth  cats,  after  ourishing  for more than 30 million years, disappeared, and so did the giant ground sloths, the oversized  lions,  native  American  horses,  native  American  camels,  the  giant rodents  and  the  mammoths.  Thousands  of  species  of  smaller  mammals,  reptiles, birds,  and  even  insects  and  parasites  also  became  extinct  (when  the  mammoths died out, all species of mammoth ticks followed them to oblivion). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  decades,  palaeontologists  and  zooarchaeologists  –  people  who  search  for and study animal remains – have been combing the plains and mountains of the Americas  in  search  of  the  fossilised  bones  of  ancient  camels  and  the  petri ed faeces  of  giant  ground  sloths.  When  they  nd  what  they  seek,  the  treasures  are carefully  packed  up  and  sent  to  laboratories,  where  every  bone  and  every coprolite  (the  technical  name  for  fossilised  turds)  is  meticulously  studied  and dated.  Time  and  again,  these  analyses  yield  the  same  results:  the  freshest  dung balls and the most recent camel bones date to the period when humans  ooded</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>America,  that  is,  between  approximately  12,000  and  9000 BC.  Only  in  one  area have  scientists  discovered  younger  dung  balls:  on  several  Caribbean  islands,  in particular Cuba and Hispaniola, they found petri ed ground-sloth scat dating to about 5000 BC. This is exactly the time when the  rst humans managed to cross the Caribbean Sea and settle these two large islands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, some scholars try to exonerate  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> and blame climate change (which requires them to posit that, for some mysterious reason, the climate in the Caribbean  islands  remained  static  for  7,000  years  while  the  rest  of  the  western hemisphere warmed). But in America, the dung ball cannot be dodged. We are the culprits. There is no way around that truth. Even if climate change abetted us, the human contribution was decisive<a href="index_split_005.html#p355">.7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Noah’s Ark</p>
<p class="calibre1">If we combine the mass extinctions in Australia and America, and add the smaller-scale extinctions that took place as  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> spread over Afro-Asia – such as the extinction of all other human species – and the extinctions that occurred when ancient foragers settled remote islands such as Cuba, the inevitable conclusion is that  the  rst  wave  of  Sapiens  colonisation  was  one  of  the  biggest  and  swiftest ecological disasters to befall the animal kingdom. Hardest hit were the large furry creatures. At the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200  genera  of  large  terrestrial  mammals  weighing  over  fty  kilograms.  At  the time of the Agricultural Revolution, only about a hundred remained.  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> drove  to  extinction  about  half  of  the  planet’s  big  beasts  long  before  humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  ecological  tragedy  was  restaged  in  miniature  countless  times  after  the Agricultural Revolution. The archaeological record of island after island tells the same  sad  story.  The  tragedy  opens  with  a  scene  showing  a  rich  and  varied population of large animals, without any trace of humans. In scene two, Sapiens appear, evidenced by a human bone, a spear point, or perhaps a potsherd. Scene three  quickly  follows,  in  which  men  and  women  occupy  centre  stage  and  most large animals, along with many smaller ones, are gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  large  island  of  Madagascar,  about  400  kilometres  east  of  the  African mainland,  o ers  a  famous  example.  Through  millions  of  years  of  isolation,  a unique  collection  of  animals  evolved  there.  These  included  the  elephant  bird,  a ightless creature three metres tall and weighing almost half a ton – the largest bird  in  the  world  –  and  the  giant  lemurs,  the  globe’s  largest  primates.  The elephant birds and the giant lemurs, along with most of the other large animals of</p>

<p class="calibre1">In the Paci c Ocean, the main wave of extinction began in about 1500 BC, when Polynesian  farmers  settled  the  Solomon  Islands,  Fiji  and  New  Caledonia.  They killed  o ,  directly  or  indirectly,  hundreds  of  species  of  birds,  insects,  snails  and other local inhabitants. From there, the wave of extinction moved gradually to the east, the south and the north, into the heart of the Paci c Ocean, obliterating on its way the unique fauna of Samoa and Tonga (1200 BC); the Marquis Islands (AD 1); Easter Island, the Cook Islands and Hawaii (AD 500); and  nally New Zealand (AD</p>
<p class="calibre1">1200). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similar  ecological  disasters  occurred  on  almost  every  one  of  the  thousands  of islands  that  pepper  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  Indian  Ocean,  Arctic  Ocean  and Mediterranean  Sea.  Archaeologists  have  discovered  on  even  the  tiniest  islands evidence of the existence of birds, insects and snails that lived there for countless generations, only to vanish when the  rst human farmers arrived. None but a few extremely  remote  islands  escaped  man’s  notice  until  the  modern  age,  and  these islands  kept  their  fauna  intact.  The  Galapagos  Islands,  to  give  one  famous example,  remained  uninhabited  by  humans  until  the  nineteenth  century,  thus preserving their unique menagerie, including their giant tortoises, which, like the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>ancient diprotodons, show no fear of humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The First Wave Extinction, which accompanied the spread of the foragers, was followed  by  the  Second  Wave  Extinction,  which  accompanied  the  spread  of  the farmers,  and  gives  us  an  important  perspective  on  the  Third  Wave  Extinction, which  industrial  activity  is  causing  today.  Don’t  believe  tree-huggers  who  claim that  our  ancestors  lived  in  harmony  with  nature.  Long  before  the  Industrial Revolution,  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  held  the  record  among  all  organisms  for  driving  the most  plant  and  animal  species  to  their  extinctions.  We  have  the  dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  if  more  people  were  aware  of  the  First  Wave  and  Second  Wave extinctions, they’d be less nonchalant about the Third Wave they are part of. If we knew how many species we’ve already eradicated, we might be more motivated to protect those that still survive. This is especially relevant to the large animals of the  oceans.  Unlike  their  terrestrial  counterparts,  the  large  sea  animals  su ered relatively little from the Cognitive and Agricultural Revolutions. But many of them are on the brink of extinction now as a result of industrial pollution and human overuse of oceanic resources. If things continue at the present pace, it is likely that whales, sharks, tuna and dolphins will follow the diprotodons, ground sloths and mammoths to oblivion. Among all the world’s large creatures, the only survivors of  the  human  ood  will  be  humans  themselves,  and  the  farmyard  animals  that serve as galley slaves in Noah’s Ark. </p>

<p class="calibre1">History’s Biggest Fraud</p>
<p class="calibre1">FOR  2.5  MILLION  YEARS  HUMANS  FED  themselves  by  gathering  plants  and hunting  animals  that  lived  and  bred  without  their  intervention.  <i class="calibre4">Homo  erectus</i>, <i class="calibre4">Homo  ergaster</i>  and  the  Neanderthals  plucked  wild  gs  and  hunted  wild  sheep without  deciding  where  g  trees  would  take  root,  in  which  meadow  a  herd  of sheep  should  graze,  or  which  billy  goat  would  inseminate  which  nanny  goat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> spread from East Africa to the Middle East, to Europe and Asia, and nally  to  Australia  and  America  –  but  everywhere  they  went,  Sapiens  too continued  to  live  by  gathering  wild  plants  and  hunting  wild  animals.  Why  do anything else when your lifestyle feeds you amply and supports a rich world of social structures, religious beliefs and political dynamics? </p>
<p class="calibre1">All this changed about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to devote almost all  their  time  and  e ort  to  manipulating  the  lives  of  a  few  animal  and  plant species.  From  sunrise  to  sunset  humans  sowed  seeds,  watered  plants,  plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to prime pastures. This work, they thought, would provide them with more fruit, grain and meat. It was a revolution in the way humans lived – the Agricultural Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The transition to agriculture began around 9500–8500 BC in the hill country of south-eastern  Turkey,  western  Iran,  and  the  Levant.  It  began  slowly  and  in  a restricted  geographical  area.  Wheat  and  goats  were  domesticated  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximately  9000 BC;  peas  and  lentils  around  8000 BC;  olive  trees  by  5000 BC; horses  by  4000 BC; and grapevines in 3500 BC. Some animals and plants, such as camels and cashew nuts, were domesticated even later, but by 3500 BC the main wave of domestication was over. Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC – wheat, rice, maize (called ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley. No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years. If our minds are those of hunter-gatherers, our cuisine is that of ancient farmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scholars  once  believed  that  agriculture  spread  from  a  single  Middle  Eastern point  of  origin  to  the  four  corners  of  the  world.  Today,  scholars  agree  that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>agriculture  sprang  up  in  other  parts  of  the  world  not  by  the  action  of  Middle Eastern farmers exporting their revolution but entirely independently. People in Central America domesticated maize and beans without knowing anything about wheat  and  pea  cultivation  in  the  Middle  East.  South  Americans  learned  how  to raise potatoes and llamas, unaware of what was going on in either Mexico or the Levant.  Chinas  rst  revolutionaries  domesticated  rice,  millet  and  pigs.  North America’s first gardeners were those who got tired of combing the undergrowth for edible gourds and decided to cultivate pumpkins. New Guineans tamed sugar cane and  bananas,  while  the  rst  West  African  farmers  made  African  millet,  African rice, sorghum and wheat conform to their needs. From these initial focal points, agriculture spread far and wide. By the  rst century AD the vast majority of people throughout most of the world were agriculturists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why  did  agricultural  revolutions  erupt  in  the  Middle  East,  China  and  Central America but not in Australia, Alaska or South Africa? The reason is simple: most species of plants and animals can’t be domesticated. Sapiens could dig up delicious tru es  and  hunt  down  woolly  mammoths,  but  domesticating  either  species  was out of the question. The fungi were far too elusive, the giant beasts too ferocious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of the thousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few were  suitable  candidates  for  farming  and  herding.  Those  few  species  lived  in particular places, and those are the places where agricultural revolutions occurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scholars once proclaimed that the agricultural revolution was a great leap forward for  humanity.  They  told  a  tale  of  progress  fuelled  by  human  brain  power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evolution  gradually  produced  ever  more  intelligent  people.  Eventually,  people were so smart that they were able to decipher nature’s secrets, enabling them to tame  sheep  and  cultivate  wheat.  As  soon  as  this  happened,  they  cheerfully abandoned  the  gruelling,  dangerous,  and  often  spartan  life  of  hunter-gatherers, settling down to enjoy the pleasant, satiated life of farmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a><img src="index-72_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">That tale is a fantasy. There is no evidence that people became more intelligent with  time.  Foragers  knew  the  secrets  of  nature  long  before  the  Agricultural Revolution,  since  their  survival  depended  on  an  intimate  knowledge  of  the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered. Rather than heralding a new era  of  easy  living,  the  Agricultural  Revolution  left  farmers  with  lives  generally more  di cult  and  less  satisfying  than  those  of  foragers.  Hunter-gatherers  spent their  time  in  more  stimulating  and  varied  ways,  and  were  less  in  danger  of starvation  and  disease.  The  Agricultural  Revolution  certainly  enlarged  the  sum total  of  food  at  the  disposal  of  humankind,  but  the  extra  food  did  not  translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Who  was  responsible?  Neither  kings,  nor  priests,  nor  merchants.  The  culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These plants domesticated  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i>, rather than vice versa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think  for  a  moment  about  the  Agricultural  Revolution  from  the  viewpoint  of wheat.  Ten  thousand  years  ago  wheat  was  just  a  wild  grass,  one  of  many, con ned  to  a  small  range  in  the  Middle  East.  Suddenly,  within  just  a  few  short millennia, it was growing all over the world. According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction, wheat has become one of the most successful plants  in  the  history  of  the  earth.  In  areas  such  as  the  Great  Plains  of  North</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk  for  hundreds  upon  hundreds  of  kilometres  without  encountering  any  other plant. Worldwide, wheat covers about 2.25 million square kilometres of the globes surface,  almost  ten  times  the  size  of  Britain.  How  did  this  grass  turn  from insignificant to ubiquitous? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wheat did it by manipulating  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> to its advantage. This ape had been living  a  fairly  comfortable  life  hunting  and  gathering  until  about  10,000  years ago, but then began to invest more and more e ort in cultivating wheat. Within a couple  of  millennia,  humans  in  many  parts  of  the  world  were  doing  little  from dawn  to  dusk  other  than  taking  care  of  wheat  plants.  It  wasn’t  easy.  Wheat demanded  a  lot  of  them.  Wheat  didn’t  like  rocks  and  pebbles,  so  Sapiens  broke their backs clearing  elds. Wheat didn’t like sharing its space, water and nutrients with  other  plants,  so  men  and  women  laboured  long  days  weeding  under  the scorching sun. Wheat got sick, so Sapiens had to keep a watch out for worms and blight. Wheat was defenceless against other organisms that liked to eat it, from rabbits to locust swarms, so the farmers had to guard and protect it. Wheat was thirsty, so humans lugged water from springs and streams to water it. Its hunger even  impelled  Sapiens  to  collect  animal  faeces  to  nourish  the  ground  in  which wheat grew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  body  of  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  had  not  evolved  for  such  tasks.  It  was  adapted  to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price. Studies of ancient  skeletons  indicate that  the  transition  to  agriculture  brought  about  a plethora  of  ailments,  such  as  slipped  discs,  arthritis  and  hernias.  Moreover,  the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat  elds. This completely changed their way of life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‘domesticate’ comes from the Latin  <i class="calibre4">domus</i>, which means ‘house’. Who’s the one living in a house? Not the wheat. It’s the Sapiens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did wheat convince  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> to exchange a rather good life for a more miserable  existence?  What  did  it  o er  in  return?  It  did  not  o er  a  better  diet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember, humans are omnivorous apes who thrive on a wide variety of foods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grains  made  up  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  human  diet  before  the  Agricultural Revolution.  A  diet  based  on  cereals  is  poor  in  minerals  and  vitamins,  hard  to digest, and really bad for your teeth and gums. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wheat did not give people economic security. The life of a peasant is less secure than that of a hunter-gatherer. Foragers relied on dozens of species to survive, and could therefore weather di cult years even without stocks of preserved food. If the availability of one species was reduced, they could gather and hunt more of other species. Farming societies have, until very recently, relied for the great bulk</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a><img src="index-74_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">of their calorie intake on a small variety of domesticated plants. In many areas, they  relied  on  just  a  single  staple,  such  as  wheat,  potatoes  or  rice.  If  the  rains failed or clouds of locusts arrived or if a fungus learned how to infect that staple species, peasants died by the thousands and millions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor could wheat o er security against human violence. The early farmers were at  least  as  violent  as  their  forager  ancestors,  if  not  more  so.  Farmers  had  more possessions  and  needed  land  for  planting.  The  loss  of  pasture  land  to  raiding neighbours could mean the di erence between subsistence and starvation, so there was much less room for compromise. When a foraging band was hard-pressed by a stronger rival, it could usually move on. It was di cult and dangerous, but it was feasible. When a strong enemy threatened an agricultural village, retreat meant giving up  elds, houses and granaries. In many cases, this doomed the refugees to starvation. Farmers, therefore, tended to stay put and fight to the bitter end. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">12. </b></a><b class="calibre3">Tribal warfare in New Guinea between two farming communities (1960). Such scenes were probably</b> <b class="calibre3">widespread in the thousands of years following the Agricultural Revolution</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  anthropological  and  archaeological  studies  indicate  that  in  simple agricultural  societies  with  no  political  frameworks  beyond  village  and  tribe, human violence was responsible for about 15 per cent of deaths, including 25 per cent of male deaths. In contemporary New Guinea, violence accounts for 30 per cent of male deaths in one agricultural tribal society, the Dani, and 35 per cent in another,  the  Enga.  In  Ecuador,  perhaps  50  per  cent  of  adult  Waoranis  meet  a violent  death  at  the  hands  of  another  human<a href="index_split_005.html#p356">!3</a>  In  time,  human  violence  was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>brought  under  control  through  the  development  of  larger  social  frameworks  –</p>
<p class="calibre1">cities, kingdoms and states. But it took thousands of years to build such huge and effective political structures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Village life certainly brought the  rst farmers some immediate bene ts, such as better protection against wild animals, rain and cold. Yet for the average person, the disadvantages probably outweighed the advantages. This is hard for people in today’s prosperous societies to appreciate. Since we enjoy a uence and security, and  since  our  a uence  and  security  are  built  on  foundations  laid  by  the Agricultural  Revolution,  we  assume  that  the  Agricultural  Revolution  was  a wonderful  improvement.  Yet  it  is  wrong  to  judge  thousands  of  years  of  history from the perspective of today. A much more representative viewpoint is that of a three-year-old  girl  dying  from  malnutrition  in  rst-century  China  because  her father’s  crops  have  failed.  Would  she  say  ‘I  am  dying  from  malnutrition,  but  in 2,000 years, people will have plenty to eat and live in big air-conditioned houses, so my suffering is a worthwhile sacrifice’? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  then  did  wheat  o er  agriculturists,  including  that  malnourished  Chinese girl? It o ered nothing for people as individuals. Yet it did bestow something on <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> as a species. Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory,  and  thereby  enabled  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  to  multiply  exponentially.  Around 13,000 BC, when people fed themselves by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals, the area around the oasis of Jericho, in Palestine, could support at most one  roaming  band  of  about  a  hundred  relatively  healthy  and  well-nourished people.  Around  8500 BC,  when  wild  plants  gave  way  to  wheat  elds,  the  oasis supported  a  large  but  cramped  village  of  1,000  people,  who  su ered  far  more from disease and malnourishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes.  Just  as  the  economic  success  of  a  company  is  measured  only  by  the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA.  If  no  more  DNA  copies  remain,  the  species  is  extinct,  just  as  a  company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species  ourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than  a  hundred  copies.  This  is  the  essence  of  the  Agricultural  Revolution:  the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  why  should  individuals  care  about  this  evolutionary  calculus?  Why  would any sane person lower his or her standard of living just to multiply the number of copies of the  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> genome? Nobody agreed to this deal: the Agricultural Revolution was a trap. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>The Luxury Trap</p>
<p class="calibre1">The rise of farming was a very gradual a air spread over centuries and millennia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  band  of  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  gathering  mushrooms  and  nuts  and  hunting  deer  and rabbit  did  not  all  of  a  sudden  settle  in  a  permanent  village,  ploughing  elds, sowing wheat and carrying water from the river. The change proceeded by stages, each of which involved just a small alteration in daily life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>  reached  the  Middle  East  around  70,000  years  ago.  For  the  next 50,000  years  our  ancestors  ourished  there  without  agriculture.  The  natural resources of the area were enough to support its human population. In times of plenty people had a few more children, and in times of need a few less. Humans, like  many  mammals,  have  hormonal  and  genetic  mechanisms  that  help  control procreation.  In  good  times  females  reach  puberty  earlier,  and  their  chances  of getting  pregnant  are  a  bit  higher.  In  bad  times  puberty  is  late  and  fertility decreases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  these  natural  population  controls  were  added  cultural  mechanisms.  Babies and small children, who move slowly and demand much attention, were a burden on nomadic foragers. People tried to space their children three to four years apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Women  did  so  by  nursing  their  children  around  the  clock  and  until  a  late  age (around-the-clock  suckling  signi cantly  decreases  the  chances  of  getting pregnant).  Other  methods  included  full  or  partial  sexual  abstinence  (backed perhaps by cultural taboos), abortions and occasionally infanticide. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">During these long millennia people occasionally ate wheat grain, but this was a marginal part of their diet. About 18,000 years ago, the last ice age gave way to a period of global warming. As temperatures rose, so did rainfall. The new climate was  ideal  for  Middle  Eastern  wheat  and  other  cereals,  which  multiplied  and spread.  People  began  eating  more  wheat,  and  in  exchange  they  inadvertently spread  its  growth.  Since  it  was  impossible  to  eat  wild  grains  without  rst winnowing, grinding and cooking them, people who gathered these grains carried them  back  to  their  temporary  campsites  for  processing.  Wheat  grains  are  small and  numerous,  so  some of  them  inevitably  fell  on  the  way  to  the  campsite  and were  lost.  Over  time,  more  and  more  wheat  grew  along  favourite  human  trails and near campsites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  humans  burned  down  forests  and  thickets,  this  also  helped  wheat.  Fire cleared away trees and shrubs, allowing wheat and other grasses to monopolise the  sunlight,  water  and  nutrients.  Where  wheat  became  particularly  abundant, and  game  and  other  food  sources  were  also  plentiful,  human  bands  could gradually  give  up  their  nomadic  lifestyle  and  settle  down  in  seasonal  and  even permanent camps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  rst they might have camped for four weeks during the harvest. A generation</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>later, as wheat plants multiplied and spread, the harvest camp might have lasted for  ve weeks, then six, and  nally it became a permanent village. Evidence of such settlements has been discovered throughout the Middle East, particularly in the Levant, where the Natu an culture  ourished from 12,500 BC  to  9500 BC.  The Natu ans were hunter-gatherers who subsisted on dozens of wild species, but they lived  in  permanent  villages  and  devoted  much  of  their  time  to  the  intensive gathering and processing of wild cereals. They built stone houses and granaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stored grain for times of need. They invented new tools such as stone scythes for harvesting wild wheat, and stone pestles and mortars to grind it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  years  following  9500 BC,  the  descendants  of  the  Natu ans  continued  to gather  and  process  cereals,  but  they  also  began  to  cultivate  them  in  more  and more elaborate ways. When gathering wild grains, they took care to lay aside part of  the  harvest  to  sow  the  elds  next  season.  They  discovered  that  they  could achieve much better results by sowing the grains deep in the ground rather than haphazardly  scattering  them  on  the  surface.  So  they  began  to  hoe  and  plough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gradually  they  also  started  to  weed  the  elds,  to  guard  them  against  parasites, and  to  water  and  fertilise  them.  As  more  e ort  was  directed  towards  cereal cultivation,  there  was  less  time  to  gather  and  hunt  wild  species.  The  foragers became farmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  single  step  separated  the  woman  gathering  wild  wheat  from  the  woman farming  domesticated  wheat,  so  it’s  hard  to  say  exactly  when  the  decisive transition to agriculture took place. But, by 8500 BC, the Middle East was peppered with  permanent  villages such  as  Jericho,  whose  inhabitants  spent  most  of  their time cultivating a few domesticated species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  move  to  permanent  villages  and  the  increase  in  food  supply,  the population  began  to  grow.  Giving  up  the  nomadic  lifestyle  enabled  women  to have a child every year. Babies were weaned at an earlier age – they could be fed on porridge and gruel. The extra hands were sorely needed in the  elds. But the extra mouths quickly wiped out the food surpluses, so even more  elds had to be planted.  As  people  began  living  in  disease-ridden  settlements,  as  children  fed more on cereals and less on mother’s milk, and as each child competed for his or her  porridge  with  more  and  more  siblings,  child  mortality  soared.  In  most agricultural societies at least one out of every three children died before reaching twenty. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">5 </a>Yet the increase in births still outpaced the increase in deaths; humans kept having larger numbers of children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  time,  the  ‘wheat  bargain’  became  more  and  more  burdensome.  Children died  in  droves,  and  adults  ate  bread  by  the  sweat  of  their  brows.  The  average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of  9500 BC  or  13,000 BC.  But  nobody  realised  what  was  happening.  Every</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>generation  continued  to  live  like  the  previous  generation,  making  only  small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why did people make such a fateful miscalculation? For the same reason that people throughout history have miscalculated. People were unable to fathom the full  consequences  of  their  decisions.  Whenever  they  decided  to  do  a  bit  of  extra work – say, to hoe the  elds instead of scattering seeds on the surface – people thought, ‘Yes, we will have to work harder. But the harvest will be so bountiful! </p>
<p class="calibre1">We won’t have to worry any more about lean years. Our children will never go to sleep hungry.’ It made sense. If you worked harder, you would have a better life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst  part  of  the  plan  went  smoothly.  People  indeed  worked  harder.  But people did not foresee that the number of children would increase, meaning that the extra wheat would have to be shared between more children. Neither did the early farmers understand that feeding children with more porridge and less breast milk would weaken their immune system, and that permanent settlements would be  hotbeds  for  infectious  diseases.  They  did  not  foresee  that  by  increasing  their dependence  on  a  single  source  of  food,  they  were  actually  exposing  themselves even  more  to  the  depredations  of  drought.  Nor  did  the  farmers  foresee  that  in good years their bulging granaries would tempt thieves and enemies, compelling them to start building walls and doing guard duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  why  didn’t  humans  abandon  farming  when  the  plan  back red?  Partly because  it  took  generations  for  the  small  changes  to  accumulate  and  transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly  because  population  growth  burned  humanity’s  boats.  If  the  adoption  of ploughing  increased  a  village’s  population  from  a  hundred  to  no,  which  ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for the last time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  happens  to  us  today.  How  many  young  college  graduates  have  taken demanding jobs in high-powered  rms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty- ve? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children  to  school,  houses  in  the  suburbs  that  necessitate  at  least  two  cars  per family,  and  a  sense  that  life  is  not  worth  living  without  really  good  wine  and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>granted.  Then  they  begin  to  count  on  it.  Finally  they  reach  a  point  where  they can’t live without it. Let’s take another familiar example from our own time. Over the  last  few  decades,  we  have  invented  countless  time-saving  devices  that  are supposed  to  make  life  more  relaxed  –  washing  machines,  vacuum  cleaners, dishwashers, telephones, mobile phones, computers, email. Previously it took a lot of  work  to  write  a  letter,  address and  stamp  an  envelope,  and  take  it  to  the mailbox. It took days or weeks, maybe even months, to get a reply. Nowadays I can dash o  an email, send it halfway around the globe, and (if my addressee is online) receive a reply a minute later. I’ve saved all that trouble and time, but do I live a more relaxed life? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadly  not.  Back  in  the  snail-mail  era,  people  usually  only  wrote  letters  when they had something important to relate. Rather than writing the  rst thing that came into their heads, they considered carefully what they wanted to say and how to phrase it. They expected to receive a similarly considered answer. Most people wrote  and  received  no  more  than  a  handful  of  letters  a  month  and  seldom  felt compelled  to  reply  immediately.  Today  I  receive  dozens  of  emails  each  day,  all from people who expect a prompt reply. We thought we were saving time; instead we revved up the treadmill of life to ten times its former speed and made our days more anxious and agitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here  and  there  a  Luddite  holdout  refuses  to  open  an  email  account,  just  as thousands  of  years  ago  some  human  bands  refused  to  take  up  farming  and  so escaped the luxury trap. But the Agricultural Revolution didn’t need every band in a  given  region  to  join  up.  It  only  took  one.  Once  one  band  settled  down  and started  tilling,  whether  in  the  Middle  East  or  Central  America,  agriculture  was irresistible.  Since  farming  created  the  conditions  for  swift  demographic  growth, farmers could usually overcome foragers by sheer weight of numbers. The foragers could either run away, abandoning their hunting grounds to  eld and pasture, or take up the ploughshare themselves. Either way, the old life was doomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  story  of  the  luxury  trap  carries  with  it  an  important  lesson.  Humanity’s search for an easier life released immense forces of change that transformed the world  in  ways  nobody  envisioned  or  wanted.  Nobody  plotted  the  Agricultural Revolution or sought human dependence on cereal cultivation. A series of trivial decisions aimed mostly at  lling a few stomachs and gaining a little security had the  cumulative  e ect  of  forcing  ancient  foragers  to  spend  their  days  carrying water buckets under a scorching sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divine Intervention</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>The above scenario explains the Agricultural Revolution as a miscalculation. It’s very  plausible.  History  is  full  of  far  more  idiotic  miscalculations.  But  there’s another  possibility.  Maybe  it  wasn’t  the  search  for  an  easier  life  that  brought about  the  transformation.  Maybe  Sapiens  had  other  aspirations,  and  were consciously willing to make their lives harder in order to achieve them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scientists usually seek to attribute historical developments to cold economic and demographic factors. It sits better with their rational and mathematical methods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  case  of  modern  history,  scholars  cannot  avoid  taking  into  account  non-material  factors  such  as  ideology  and  culture.  The  written  evidence  forces  their hand. We have enough documents, letters and memoirs to prove that World War Two was not caused by food shortages or demographic pressures. But we have no documents  from  the  Natu an  culture,  so  when  dealing  with  ancient  periods  the materialist  school  reigns  supreme.  It  is  di cult  to  prove  that  preliterate  people were motivated by faith rather than economic necessity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,  in  some  rare  cases,  we  are  lucky  enough  to  nd  telltale  clues.  In  1995</p>
<p class="calibre1">archaeologists began to excavate a site in south-east Turkey called Göbekli Tepe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  oldest  stratum  they  discovered  no  signs  of  a  settlement,  houses  or  daily activities. They did, however,  nd monumental pillared structures decorated with spectacular engravings. Each stone pillar weighed up to seven tons and reached a height  of  ve  metres.  In  a  nearby  quarry  they  found  a  half-chiselled  pillar weighing  fty  tons.  Altogether,  they  uncovered  more  than  ten  monumental structures, the largest of them nearly thirty metres across. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Archaeologists are familiar with such monumental structures from sites around the world – the best-known example is Stonehenge in Britain. Yet as they studied Göbekli Tepe, they discovered an amazing fact. Stonehenge dates to 2500 BC, and was built by a developed agricultural society. The structures at Göbekli Tepe are dated to about 9500 BC, and all available evidence indicates that they were built by hunter-gatherers. The archaeological community initially found it difficult to credit these  ndings,  but  one  test  after  another  con rmed  both  the  early  date  of  the structures  and  the  pre-agricultural  society  of  their  builders.  The  capabilities  of ancient  foragers,  and  the  complexity  of  their  cultures,  seem  to  be  far  more impressive than was previously suspected. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a><img src="index-81_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">13. </b></a><b class="calibre3">Opposite: The remains of a monumental structure from Göbekli Tepe. Right: One of the decorated</b> <b class="calibre3">stone pillars (about five metres high)</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why  would  a  foraging  society  build  such  structures?  They  had  no  obvious utilitarian  purpose.  They  were  neither  mammoth  slaughterhouses  nor  places  to shelter from rain or hide from lions. That leaves us with the theory that they were built  for  some  mysterious  cultural  purpose  that  archaeologists  have  a  hard  time deciphering.  Whatever  it  was,  the  foragers  thought  it  worth  a  huge  amount  of e ort and time. The only way to build Göbekli Tepe was for thousands of foragers belonging to di erent bands and tribes to cooperate over an extended period of time.  Only  a  sophisticated  religious  or  ideological  system  could  sustain  such efforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Göbekli Tepe held another sensational secret. For many years, geneticists have been tracing the origins of domesticated wheat. Recent discoveries indicate that at least one domesticated variant, einkorn wheat, originated in the Karaçadag Hills –</p>
<p class="calibre1">about thirty kilometres from Göbekli Tepe. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a><img src="index-82_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">This can hardly be a coincidence. It’s likely that the cultural centre of Göbekli Tepe was somehow connected to the initial domestication of wheat by humankind and of humankind by wheat. In order to feed the people who built and used the monumental structures, particularly large quantities of food were required. It may well  be  that  foragers  switched  from  gathering  wild  wheat  to  intense  wheat cultivation,  not  to  increase  their  normal  food  supply,  but  rather  to  support  the building and running of a temple. In the conventional picture, pioneers  rst built a village, and when it prospered, they set up a temple in the middle. But Göbekli Tepe suggests that the temple may have been built  rst, and that a village later grew up around it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victims of the Revolution</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Faustian  bargain  between  humans  and  grains  was  not  the  only  deal  our species  made.  Another  deal  was  struck  concerning  the  fate  of  animals  such  as sheep, goats, pigs and chickens. Nomadic bands that stalked wild sheep gradually altered the constitutions of the herds on which they preyed. This process probably began with selective hunting. Humans learned that it was to their advantage to hunt only adult rams and old or sick sheep. They spared fertile females and young</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>lambs  in  order  to  safeguard  the  long-term  vitality  of  the  local  herd.  The  second step might have been to actively defend the herd against predators, driving away lions, wolves and rival human bands. The band might next have corralled the herd into a narrow gorge in order to better control and defend it. Finally, people began to  make  a  more  careful  selection  among  the  sheep  in  order  to  tailor  them  to human needs. The most aggressive rams, those that showed the greatest resistance to  human  control,  were  slaughtered  rst.  So  were  the  skinniest  and  most inquisitive females. (Shepherds are not fond of sheep whose curiosity takes them far from the herd.) With each passing generation, the sheep became fatter, more submissive  and  less  curious.  <i class="calibre4">Voilà</i>!  Mary  had  a  little  lamb  and  everywhere  that Mary went the lamb was sure to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alternatively, hunters may have caught and adopted’ a lamb, fattening it during the months of plenty and slaughtering it in the leaner season. At some stage they began  keeping  a  greater  number  of  such  lambs.  Some  of  these  reached  puberty and began to procreate. The most aggressive and unruly lambs were  rst to the slaughter. The most submissive, most appealing lambs were allowed to live longer and procreate. The result was a herd of domesticated and submissive sheep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  domesticated  animals  –  sheep,  chickens,  donkeys  and  others  –  supplied food  (meat,  milk,  eggs),  raw  materials  (skins,  wool),  and  muscle  power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Transportation,  ploughing,  grinding  and  other  tasks,  hitherto  performed  by human sinew, were increasingly carried out by animals. In most farming societies people focused on plant cultivation; raising animals was a secondary activity. But a  new  kind  of  society  also  appeared  in  some  places,  based  primarily  on  the exploitation of animals: tribes of pastoralist herders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  humans  spread  around  the  world,  so  did  their  domesticated  animals.  Ten thousand years ago, not more than a few million sheep, cattle, goats, boars and chickens lived in restricted Afro-Asian niches. Today the world contains about a billion sheep, a billion pigs, more than a billion cattle, and more than 25 billion chickens. And they are all over the globe. The domesticated chicken is the most widespread  fowl  ever.  Following  <i class="calibre4">Homo  sapiens</i>,  domesticated  cattle,  pigs  and sheep  are  the  second,  third  and  fourth  most  widespread  large  mammals  in  the world.  From  a  narrow  evolutionary  perspective,  which  measures  success  by  the number  of  DNA  copies,  the  Agricultural  Revolution  was  a  wonderful  boon  for chickens, cattle, pigs and sheep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,  the  evolutionary  perspective  is  an  incomplete  measure  of success. It judges everything by the criteria of survival and reproduction, with no regard  for  individual  su ering  and  happiness.  Domesticated  chickens  and  cattle may  well  be  an  evolutionary  success  story,  but  they  are  also  among  the  most miserable creatures that ever lived. The domestication of animals was founded on a  series  of  brutal  practices  that  only  became  crueller  with  the  passing  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a><img src="index-84_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  natural  lifespan  of  wild  chickens  is  about  seven  to  twelve  years,  and  of cattle  about  twenty  to  twenty- ve  years.  In  the  wild,  most  chickens  and  cattle died long before that, but they still had a fair chance of living for a respectable number of years. In contrast, the vast majority of domesticated chickens and cattle are slaughtered at the age of between a few weeks and a few months, because this has  always  been  the  optimal  slaughtering  age  from  an  economic  perspective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Why keep feeding a cock for three years if it has already reached its maximum weight after three months?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Egg-laying hens, dairy cows and draught animals are sometimes allowed to live for many years. But the price is subjugation to a way of life completely alien to their urges and desires. It’s reasonable to assume, for example, that bulls prefer to spend their days wandering over open prairies in the company of other bulls and cows  rather  than  pulling  carts  and  ploughshares  under  the  yoke  of  a  whip-wielding ape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  turn  bulls,  horses,  donkeys  and  camels  into  obedient  draught animals, their natural instincts and social ties had to be broken, their aggression and  sexuality  contained,  and  their  freedom  of  movement  curtailed.  Farmers developed techniques such as locking animals inside pens and cages, bridling them in  harnesses  and  leashes,  training  them  with  whips  and  cattle  prods,  and mutilating them. The process of taming almost always involves the castration of males.  This  restrains  male  aggression  and  enables  humans  selectively  to  control the herd’s procreation. </p>

(Note the hunched position of the Egyptian farmer who, much like the ox, spent his life in</b> <b class="calibre3">hard labour oppressive to his body, his mind and his social relationships.)</b> In many New Guinean societies, the wealth of a person has traditionally been determined by the number of pigs he or she owns. To ensure that the pigs can’t run away, farmers in northern New Guinea slice o  a chunk of each pig’s nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This causes severe pain whenever the pig tries to sni . Since the pigs cannot  nd food or even  nd their way around without sni ng, this mutilation makes them completely dependent on their human owners. In another area of New Guinea, it has been customary to gouge out pigs’ eyes, so that they cannot even see where they’re going. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  dairy  industry  has  its  own  ways  of  forcing  animals  to  do  its  will.  Cows, goats and sheep produce milk only after giving birth to calves, kids and lambs, and only as long as the youngsters are suckling. To continue a supply of animal milk, a farmer needs to have calves, kids or lambs for suckling, but must prevent them from monopolising the milk. One common method throughout history was to simply slaughter the calves and kids shortly after birth, milk the mother for all she was  worth,  and  then  get  her  pregnant  again.  This  is  still  a  very  widespread technique.  In  many  modern  dairy  farms  a  milk  cow  usually  lives  for  about  ve years  before  being  slaughtered.  During  these  ve  years  she  is  almost  constantly pregnant,  and  is  fertilised  within  60  to  120  days  after  giving  birth  in  order  to preserve  maximum  milk  production.  Her  calves  are  separated  from  her  shortly after birth. The females are reared to become the next generation of dairy cows, whereas the males are handed over to the care of the meat industry. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another method is to keep the calves and kids near their mothers, but prevent them by various stratagems from suckling too much milk. The simplest way to do that is to allow the kid or calf to start suckling, but drive it away once the milk starts  owing.  This  method  usually  encounters  resistance  from  both  kid  and mother. Some shepherd tribes used to kill the o spring, eat its  esh, and then stu the  skin.  The  stu ed  o spring  was  then  presented  to  the  mother  so  that  its presence would encourage her milk production. The Nuer tribe in the Sudan went so far as to smear stu ed animals with their mother’s urine, to give the counterfeit calves a familiar, live scent. Another Nuer technique was to tie a ring of thorns around  a  calf’s  mouth,  so  that  it  pricks  the  mother  and  causes  her  to  resist suckling. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">9 </a>Tuareg camel breeders in the Sahara used to puncture or cut o  parts of the nose and upper lip of young camels in order to make suckling painful, thereby discouraging them from consuming too much milk. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">10</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">Not  all  agricultural  societies  were  this  cruel  to  their  farm  animals.  The  lives  of some domesticated animals could be quite good. Sheep raised for wool, pet dogs and  cats,  war  horses  and  race  horses  often  enjoyed  comfortable  conditions.  The Roman  emperor  Caligula  allegedly  planned  to  appoint  his  favourite  horse, Incitatus,  to  the  consulship.  Shepherds  and  farmers  throughout  history  showed a ection  for  their  animals  and  have  taken  great  care  of  them,  just  as  many slaveholders  felt  a ection  and  concern  for  their  slaves.  It  was  no  accident  that kings and prophets styled themselves as shepherds and likened the way they and the gods cared for their people to a shepherd’s care for his flock. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_005.html#p367"><b class="calibre3">15. </b></a><b class="calibre3"> A modern calf in an industrial meat farm. Immediately after birth the calf is separated from its</b> <b class="calibre3">mother and locked inside a tiny cage not much bigger than the calf’s own body. There the calf spends its</b> <b class="calibre3">entire life – about four months on average. It never leaves its cage, nor is it allowed to play with other</b> <b class="calibre3">calves or even walk – all so that its muscles will not grow strong.

In evolutionary terms, cattle represent one of the most successful animal</b> <b class="calibre3">species ever to exist. At the same time, they are some of the most miserable animals on the planet</b>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s hard to avoid  the  impression  that  for  the  vast  majority  of  domesticated  animals,  the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. Their evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink of extinction is probably more satis ed than a calf who spends its short life inside a tiny box, fattened to produce</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>juicy steaks. The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being among the last of its kind. The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the suffering the individual endures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  discrepancy  between  evolutionary  success  and  individual  su ering  is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep  and  Sapiens,  each  with  a  complex  world  of  sensations  and  emotions,  we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience. In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective  power  and  ostensible  success  of  our  species  went  hand  in  hand  with much individual suffering. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Building Pyramids</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE  AGRICULTURAL  REVOLUTION  IS  ONE  of  the  most  controversial  events  in history. Some partisans proclaim that it set humankind on the road to prosperity and progress. Others insist that it led to perdition. This was the turning point, they say,  where  Sapiens  cast  o   its  intimate  symbiosis  with  nature  and  sprinted towards  greed  and  alienation.  Whichever  direction  the  road  led,  there  was  no going back. Farming enabled populations to increase so radically and rapidly that no  complex  agricultural  society  could  ever  again  sustain  itself  if  it  returned  to hunting  and  gathering.  Around  10,000 BC,  before  the  transition  to  agriculture, earth  was  home  to  about  5–8  million  nomadic  foragers.  By  the  rst  century AD, only 1–2 million foragers remained (mainly in Australia, America and Africa), but their numbers were dwarfed by the world’s 250 million farmers. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The vast majority of farmers lived in permanent settlements; only a few were nomadic  shepherds.  Settling  down  caused  most  peoples  turf  to  shrink dramatically. Ancient hunter-gatherers usually lived in territories covering many dozens and even hundreds of square kilometres. ‘Home’ was the entire territory, with  its  hills,  streams,  woods  and  open  sky.  Peasants,  on  the  other  hand,  spent most  of  their  days  working  a  small  eld  or  orchard,  and  their  domestic  lives centred on a cramped structure of wood, stone or mud, measuring no more than a few  dozen  metres  –  the  house.  The  typical  peasant  developed  a  very  strong attachment to this structure. This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation  from the  neighbours  became  the  psychological  hallmark  of  a  much more self-centred creature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new agricultural territories were not only far smaller than those of ancient foragers, but also far more arti cial. Aside from the use of  re, hunter-gatherers made few deliberate changes to the lands in which they roamed. Farmers, on the other hand, lived in artificial human islands that they laboriously carved out of the surrounding wilds. They cut down forests, dug canals, cleared  elds, built houses, ploughed  furrows,  and  planted  fruit  trees  in  tidy  rows.  The  resulting  arti cial habitat was meant only for humans and ‘their’ plants and animals, and was often fenced  o   by  walls  and  hedges.  Farmer  families  did  all  they  could  to  keep  out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>wayward  weeds  and  wild  animals.  If  such  interlopers  made  their  way  in,  they were  driven  out.  If  they  persisted,  their  human  antagonists  sought  ways  to exterminate  them.  Particularly  strong  defences  were  erected  around  the  home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the dawn of agriculture until this very day, billions of humans armed with branches, swatters, shoes and poison sprays have waged relentless war against the diligent  ants,  furtive  roaches,  adventurous  spiders  and  misguided  beetles  that constantly infiltrate the human domicile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For most of history these man-made enclaves remained very small, surrounded by expanses of untamed nature. The earth’s surface measures about 510 million square  kilometres,  of  which  155  million  is  land.  As  late  as AD  1400,  the  vast majority of farmers, along with their plants and animals, clustered together in an area  of  just  11  million  square  kilometres  –  2  per  cent  of  the  planet’s  surface. <a href="index_split_005.html#p356">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Everywhere else was too cold, too hot, too dry, too wet, or otherwise unsuited for cultivation. This minuscule 2 per cent of the earth’s surface constituted the stage on which history unfolded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People found it di cult to leave their arti cial islands. They could not abandon their houses,  elds and granaries without grave risk of loss. Furthermore, as time went  on  they  accumulated  more  and  more  things  –  objects,  not  easily transportable, that tied them down. Ancient farmers might seem to us dirt poor, but a typical family possessed more artefacts than an entire forager tribe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Coming of the Future</p>
<p class="calibre1">While  agricultural  space  shrank,  agricultural  time  expanded.  Foragers  usually didn’t waste much time thinking about next week or next month. Farmers sailed in their imagination years and decades into the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foragers discounted the future because they lived from hand to mouth and could only  preserve  food  or  accumulate  possessions  with  di culty.  Of  course,  they clearly engaged in some advanced planning. The creators of the cave paintings of Chauvet,  Lascaux  and  Altamira  almost  certainly  intended  them  to  last  for generations. Social alliances and political rivalries were long-term a airs. It often took  years  to  repay  a  favour  or  to  avenge  a  wrong.  Nevertheless,  in  the subsistence economy of hunting and gathering, there was an obvious limit to such long-term planning. Paradoxically, it saved foragers a lot of anxieties. There was no sense in worrying about things that they could not influence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Agricultural  Revolution  made  the  future  far  more  important  than  it  had ever been before. Farmers must always keep the future in mind and must work in its service. The agricultural economy was based on a seasonal cycle of production, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>comprising long months of cultivation followed by short peak periods of harvest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the night following the end of a plentiful harvest the peasants might celebrate for all they were worth, but within a week or so they were again up at dawn for a long day in the  eld. Although there was enough food for today, next week, and even next month, they had to worry about next year and the year after that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Concern about the future was rooted not only in seasonal cycles of production, but also in the fundamental uncertainty of agriculture. Since most villages lived by cultivating a very limited variety of domesticated plants and animals, they were at the mercy of droughts,  oods and pestilence. Peasants were obliged to produce more than they consumed so that they could build up reserves. Without grain in the silo, jars of olive oil in the cellar, cheese in the pantry and sausages hanging from  the  rafters,  they  would  starve  in  bad  years.  And  bad  years  were  bound  to come, sooner or later. A peasant living on the assumption that bad years would not come didn’t live long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently,  from  the  very  advent  of  agriculture,  worries  about  the  future became major players in the theatre of the human mind. Where farmers depended on  rains  to  water  their  elds,  the  onset  of  the  rainy  season  meant  that  each morning the farmers gazed towards the horizon, sni ng the wind and straining their eyes. Is that a cloud? Would the rains come on time? Would there be enough? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would violent storms wash the seeds from the  elds and batter down seedlings? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  in  the  valleys  of  the  Euphrates,  Indus  and  Yellow  rivers,  other peasants monitored, with no less trepidation, the height of the water. They needed the  rivers  to  rise  in  order  to  spread  the  fertile  topsoil  washed  down  from  the highlands, and to enable their vast irrigation systems to  ll with water. But  oods that surged too high or came at the wrong time could destroy their  elds as much as a drought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peasants were worried about the future not just because they had more cause for worry,  but  also  because  they  could  do  something  about  it.  They  could  clear another  eld, dig another irrigation canal, sow more crops. The anxious peasant was as frenetic and hardworking as a harvester ant in the summer, sweating to plant  olive  trees  whose  oil  would  be  pressed  by  his  children  and  grandchildren, putting o  until the winter or the following year the eating of the food he craved today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stress of farming had far-reaching consequences. It was the foundation of large-scale political and social systems. Sadly, the diligent peasants almost never achieved the future economic security they so craved through their hard work in the  present.  Everywhere,  rulers  and  elites  sprang  up,  living  o   the  peasants’</p>
<p class="calibre1">surplus food and leaving them with only a bare subsistence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  forfeited  food  surpluses  fuelled  politics,  wars,  art  and  philosophy.  They built palaces, forts, monuments and temples. Until the late modern era, more than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>90 per cent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by the sweat of their brows. The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites –</p>
<p class="calibre1">kings,  government  o cials,  soldiers,  priests,  artists  and  thinkers  –  who  ll  the history books. History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An Imagined Order</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  food  surpluses  produced  by  peasants,  coupled  with  new  transportation technology, eventually enabled more and more people to cram together  rst into large villages, then into towns, and  nally into cities, all of them joined together by new kingdoms and commercial networks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet in order to take advantage of these new opportunities, food surpluses and improved  transportation  were  not  enough.  The  mere  fact  that  one  can  feed  a thousand people in the same town or a million people in the same kingdom does not guarantee that they can agree how to divide the land and water, how to settle disputes  and  con icts,  and  how  to  act  in  times  of  drought  or  war.  And  if  no agreement can be reached, strife spreads, even if the storehouses are bulging. It was  not  food  shortages  that  caused  most  of  history’s  wars  and  revolutions.  The French  Revolution  was  spearheaded  by  a uent  lawyers,  not  by  famished peasants. The Roman Republic reached the height of its power in the  rst century BC, when treasure  eets from throughout the Mediterranean enriched the Romans beyond their ancestors’ wildest dreams. Yet it was at that moment of maximum a uence  that  the  Roman  political  order  collapsed  into  a  series  of  deadly  civil wars.  Yugoslavia  in  1991  had  more  than  enough  resources  to  feed  all  its inhabitants, and still disintegrated into a terrible bloodbath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem at the root of such calamities is that humans evolved for millions of years  in  small  bands  of  a  few  dozen  individuals.  The  handful  of  millennia separating  the  Agricultural  Revolution  from  the  appearance  of  cities,  kingdoms and  empires  was  not  enough  time  to  allow  an  instinct  for  mass  cooperation  to evolve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the lack of such biological instincts, during the foraging era, hundreds of strangers  were  able  to  cooperate  thanks  to  their  shared  myths.  However,  this cooperation was loose and limited. Every Sapiens band continued to run its life independently  and  to  provide  for  most  of  its  own  needs.  An  archaic  sociologist living  20,000  years  ago,  who  had  no  knowledge  of  events  following  the Agricultural  Revolution,  might  well  have  concluded  that  mythology  had  a  fairly limited scope. Stories about ancestral spirits and tribal totems were strong enough</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>to enable 500 people to trade seashells, celebrate the odd festival, and join forces to wipe out a Neanderthal band, but no more than that. Mythology, the ancient sociologist would have thought, could not possibly enable millions of strangers to cooperate on a daily basis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that turned out to be wrong. Myths, it transpired,  <i class="calibre4">are</i> stronger than anyone could have imagined. When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links.  While  human  evolution  was  crawling  at  its  usual  snail’s  pace,  the  human imagination  was  building  astounding  networks  of  mass  cooperation,  unlike  any other ever seen on earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around  8500 BC  the  largest  settlements  in  the  world  were  villages  such  as Jericho,  which  contained  a  few  hundred  individuals.  By  7000 BC  the  town  of Çatalhöyük in Anatolia numbered between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals. It may well  have  been  the  world’s  biggest  settlement  at  the  time.  During  the  fth  and fourth  millennia BC,  cities  with  tens  of  thousands  of  inhabitants  sprouted  in  the Fertile Crescent, and each of these held sway over many nearby villages. In 3100</p>
<p class="calibre1">BC  the  entire  lower  Nile  Valley  was  united  into  the  rst  Egyptian  kingdom.  Its pharaohs  ruled  thousands  of  square  kilometres  and  hundreds  of  thousands  of people. Around 2250 BC Sargon the Great forged the  rst empire, the Akkadian. It boasted over a million subjects and a standing army of 5,400 soldiers. Between 1000 BC and 500 BC, the  rst mega-empires appeared in the Middle East: the Late Assyrian Empire, the Babylonian Empire, and the Persian Empire. They ruled over many millions of subjects and commanded tens of thousands of soldiers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 221 BC the Qin dynasty united China, and shortly afterwards Rome united the Mediterranean basin. Taxes levied on 40 million Qin subjects paid for a standing army  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  soldiers  and  a  complex  bureaucracy  that employed more than 100,000 o cials. The Roman Empire at its zenith collected taxes from up to 100 million subjects. This revenue  nanced a standing army of 250,000–500,000  soldiers,  a  road  network  still  in  use  1,500  years  later,  and theatres and amphitheatres that host spectacles to this day. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Impressive,  no  doubt,  but  we  mustn’t  harbour  rosy  illusions  about  ‘mass cooperation  networks’  operating  in  pharaonic  Egypt  or  the  Roman  Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Cooperation’  sounds  very  altruistic,  but  is  not  always  voluntary  and  seldom egalitarian.  Most  human  cooperation  networks  have  been  geared  towards oppression  and  exploitation.  The  peasants  paid  for  the  burgeoning  cooperation networks  with  their  precious  food  surpluses,  despairing  when  the  tax  collector wiped out an entire year of hard labour with a single stroke of his imperial pen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The famed Roman amphitheatres were often built by slaves so that wealthy and idle Romans could watch other slaves engage in vicious gladiatorial combat. Even prisons and concentration camps are cooperation networks, and can function only because thousands of strangers somehow manage to coordinate their actions. </p>
